* Korean study in BMJ acupuncture journal draws criticism* Alternative medicine professor says findings not plausible* Acupuncturist more likely to reduce cash than body weightBy LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Scientists derided research
published on Tuesday that suggested ear acupuncture may help
people lose weight, saying the study's design was flawed and its
conclusions highly implausible.Responding to the findings of research published online in
the journal Acupuncture in Medicine, experts not involved in the
work said it was unreliable and probably a waste of money."It is hard to think of a treatment that is less plausible
than ear acupuncture," said Edzard Ernst, a professor of
complementary medicine at Britain's University of Exeter.A summary statement about the study, conducted by Korean
researchers, said it compared three approaches in a total of 91
people - acupuncture on five points on the outer ear,
acupuncture on one point, and a sham treatment as a control.It said participants were asked to follow a restrictive
diet, but not one designed to lead to weight loss, and not to
take any extra exercise during eight weeks of treatment.Its results suggested significant differences were apparent
after four weeks, with the active treatment groups receiving
acupuncture on one or five points having lower body mass index
scores compared with the sham treatment group, where there was
no such reduction.Weight also differed significantly after four weeks in both
active treatment groups compared with the sham treatment group,
the researchers reported in the journal, which is one of 50
specialist titles published by British Medical Journal group.According to background information given in the journal,
auricular acupuncture therapy is based on the understanding that
the outer ear represents all parts of the body and was first
used in France in 1956 by a doctor who noticed that a patient's
back-ache was cured after a burn on the ear.But external experts said this research and its apparent
conclusions should be viewed with extreme caution."While it's good to see attempts to evaluate so-called
alternative treatments using the same approach as is used for
more conventional treatments, this study has several features
that complicate the picture," said Kevin McConway, a professor
of applied statistics at Open University.He noted that more than a third of the study's small number
of starting participants did not complete the course, and yet
the main results did not take this into account."The study lasted only eight weeks, which is not long when
it comes to a long-term issue like being overweight," he said."It tells us nothing about what might happen after eight
weeks, and the world is full of weight-loss treatments that have
no demonstrable longer-term effect".Ernst, whose research at Exeter evaluates scientific
evidence for acupuncture, homeopathy, herbal medicine, and other
alternative therapies, said the trial had "several serious
flaws". He too pointed to its small sample size and high
drop-out rate, as well as what he called "questionable
statistics"."Collectively, these limitations render the findings far too
unreliable for issuing recommendations about the use of ear
acupuncture," he said. "Consulting an acupuncturist will reduce
your cash but not your body weight."
