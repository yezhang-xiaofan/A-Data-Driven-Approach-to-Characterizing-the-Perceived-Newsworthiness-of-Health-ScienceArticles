* The two disorders may have common underlying features* Findings point to new ways of tackling anorexia* Autism often diagnosed in boys, but girls may be missedBy LONDON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Scientists studying girls with the
eating disorder anorexia have found they show a mild echo of the
characteristics of autism -  a finding which could point to new
ways of helping anorexics overcome their illness.A study by the leading autism expert Simon Baron-Cohen at
Cambridge University's Autism Research Centre found that
compared to typical girls, those with anorexia have an
above-average number of autistic traits.They were also found to have an above-average interest in
systems and order, and below-average scores in empathy - a
profile similar, but less pronounced, to that seen in people
with autism, suggesting the two disorders may have common
underlying features, Baron-Cohen said."Traditionally, anorexia has been viewed purely as an eating
disorder. This is quite reasonable, since the girls' dangerously
low weight and their risk of malnutrition or even death has to
be the highest priority," he said."But this new research is suggesting that underlying the
surface behaviour, the mind of a person with anorexia may share
a lot with the mind of a person with autism. In both conditions,
there is a strong interest in systems. In girls with anorexia,
they have latched onto a system that concerns body weight,
shape, and food intake."People with autism have varying levels of impairment across
three main areas - social interaction and empathy or
understanding, repetitive behaviour and interests, and language
and communication.Cohen noted that autism and anorexia share certain features,
such as rigid attitudes and behaviours, a tendency to be very
self-focused, and a fascination with detail. Both disorders also
share similar differences in the structure and function of brain
regions involved in social perception.OVERLOOKEDAs many as one in 50 school age children in the United
States are diagnosed with autism. In Europe experts say the rate
is around one in 100 children. Most cases are diagnosed in boys.But Bonnie Auyeung, who worked with Baron-Cohen on this
latest research, said its findings suggested a proportion of
females with autism may be being overlooked or misdiagnosed
because doctors see them first with anorexia.The study, published in the BioMed Central journal Molecular
Autism, tested how 66 girls aged 12 to 18 with anorexia but
without autism scored on tests to measure autistic traits.The researchers compared them to more than 1,600 typical
teenagers in the same age range, measuring their autistic traits
using a score called the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), their
"systemising" using the Systemising Quotient (SQ), and their
empathy using the Empathy Quotient (EQ).They found that compared to typical girls on the AQ, five
times more girls with anorexia scored in the range where people
with autism score. On tests of empathy and systemising, girls
with anorexia had a higher SQ, and a reduced EQ, a profile the
researchers said parallels that seen in autism.Tony Jaffa, who co-led the study, said acknowledging that
some anorexic patients may also have a higher than normal number
of autistic traits and a love of systems offers specialists new
ideas for ways to treat people with the eating disorder."Shifting their interest away from body weight and dieting
on to a different but equally systematic topic may be helpful,"
he said. "(And) recognising that some patients with anorexia may
also need help with social skills and communication, and with
adapting to change, also gives us a new treatment angle."
