* TB often thought of as disease of the past* But study finds huge costs demand more investment* Drug-resistant cases costs tens of thousands of euros eachBy LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Europe is facing a
multi-billion-euro time bomb of rising costs to control
tuberculosis (TB) as drug-resistant forms of the lung disease
spread, a pioneering study found.Often thought of as a disease of the past or one restricted
to marginalised communities, TB is already inflicting annual
direct costs of more than 500 million euros on the region and
another 5.3 billion euros in productivity losses.The study, by health economists based in Germany, also
suggests the economic burden of TB far outweighs the likely
costs of investing in much-needed research to develop more
effective medicines and vaccines - something they said
governments and the drug industry should do urgently."We know that new drugs and vaccines are very expensive (to
develop), but if you take these costs into consideration, then
everything is justified," said Roland Diel, a health economics
professor at Germany's University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein in
Kiel, who led the study.The emergence of strains of that can't be treated with even
the most powerful of drugs has turned TB into one of the world's
most pressing health problems.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), TB
infected 8.7 million people worldwide in 2011 and killed 1.4
million. As many as 2 million people may have drug-resistant
strains by 2015, the Geneva-based health agency says.Treating even typical TB is a long process. Patients need to
take a cocktail of antibiotics for six months and many fail to
complete the treatment. That, alongside overuse and misuse of
antibiotics, has fuelled the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB
(MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant (XDR-TB).For this study, published online in the European Respiratory
Journal on Friday and the first of its kind, researchers used a
systematic review of literature and institutional websites for
the 27 EU member states to summarise data on TB treatment costs
in 2011.They split the countries into two groups based on gross
domestic product (GDP) per person.For the old EU 15 countries plus Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia,
the average direct cost per case of typical TB was 10,282 euros
($13,600), but was more than 57,200 euros for MDR cases and more
than 170,700 euros for XDR cases. For the remaining EU states,
average costs were 3,427 euros for standard treatable TB and
around 24,100 euros for drug resistant cases.The total treatment cost of all TB cases in 2011 was
536,890,315 euros ($712.26 million).While the number of drug-resistant TB cases in Europe is
currently only a tiny fraction of the total of around 70,000
cases per year, Diel said that would swiftly change."It's a time bomb in terms of drug-resistant cases. They are
just a small fraction right now, but that will increase...so the
costs will also rise," he said in a telephone interview.Beyond the direct costs, Diel's team also calculated TB's
impact in terms of the monetary value of lost productivity.Using disability-adjusted life years, or DALYs - a measure
of disease burden that looks at the number of years lost due to
ill-health, disability or early death - they found the total
years lost was 103,104 in 2011. In monetary terms, this amounted
to more than 5.3 billion euros.Diel said this was the figure that shocked him the most."People assume that in most parts of Europe, TB doesn't play
much of a role in comparison to other diseases. But, in fact,
the costs of it are very high," he told Reuters in a telephone
interview. "It's billions, and nobody realised that before."Responding to the findings, Francesco Blasi, President of
the European Respiratory Society, said they showed the huge
burden of TB on both the economy and on society in Europe."It is critical that healthcare professionals and
policymakers take note," he said in a statement.
