* Psychosis a feature of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder* Many patients don't get better with first medication* MRI brain scans used to find "markers" for drug responseBy LONDON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - The extent of "folds" on the
outer layer of the brain could give doctors a clue as to how
well people suffering problems such as hallucinations or
delusions will respond to antipsychotic drugs.Researchers using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of
people with psychosis identified patterns of folds in the brain
that could act as markers of whether a patient's symptoms will
be eased by medication.Since around half of young patients get little or no benefit
from the first medicines prescribed after a psychotic episode,
the scientists said the finding could help identify those at
greatest risk and may also help the search for better drugs."There have been few advances in developing novel
anti-psychotic drugs over the past 50 years and we still face
the same problems with a sub-group of people who do not respond
to the drugs we currently use," said Paola Dazzan from King's
College London's Institute of Psychiatry, who led the research."We could envisage using a marker like this one to identify
people who are least likely to respond to existing medications
and focus our efforts on developing new medication specifically
adapted to this group," she added.Psychosis describes mental illness symptoms like delusions
and hearing voices and can be a feature of schizophrenia, which
the World Health Organisation says affects about 24 million
people globally, and bipolar disorder, which is estimated to
affect 4 percent of people.Current treatment involves a combination of antipsychotic
drugs, psychological therapies and social support. But many
patients do not respond to the initial medicines prescribed by
their doctor, putting them at risk of further psychotic episodes
and deteriorating mental health.Dazzan's team, whose work was published on Wednesday in the
journal JAMA Psychiatry, used MRI to scan the brains of 126
people - 80 who had experienced a first episode of psychosis and
46 healthy controls.The scans were done shortly after the psychotic episodes,
and the participants were assessed again 12 weeks later to see
whether symptoms had improved after initial treatment with
antipsychotic medications.The researchers looked at a feature of the brain called
"cortical gyrification" - the extent of folding or wrinkling of
the cerebral cortex, the outermost sheet of brain tissue that
plays a key role in memory, language and consciousness.They found that people who did not respond to treatment had
less gyrification in many brain regions - particularly in areas
considered important in psychosis such as the temporal and
frontal lobes."All of us have complex and varying patterns of folding in
our brains. For the first time we are showing that the
measurement of these variations could potentially guide us in
treating psychosis," said Lena Palaniyappan of Britain's
Nottingham University, who worked with Dazzan.The researchers said their findings would need to be
validated by further studies before routine MRI scanning could
be recommended for all psychotic patients.But Dazzan said that in the longer term, "if we are able to
identify poor responders at the outset, we may be able to
formulate personalised treatment plans for that individual
patient."
