 U.S. states that opt to expand
Medicaid under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act
(ACA) can expect to enroll new patients who are younger,
thinner, healthier, less depressed and more likely to be white
than those now covered by Medicaid, U.S. researchers said on
Monday.The latest findings add to a growing picture of the incoming
class of Medicaid enrollees under the ACA, which gives states
the option to expand their Medicaid rolls to include previously
ineligible low-income adults.Medicaid expansion is expected to add more than 10 million
people to the program, which has traditionally covered poor
children, the elderly, pregnant women, the disabled and some
parents.Under Obama's signature healthcare law, the federal
government will cover 100 percent of the cost of Medicaid
expansion for the first three years and 90 percent after that,
but many states have decided against expansion, often citing the
cost of covering these new, previously uninsured individuals."There has been a lot of debate about how expensive the
Medicaid expansion would be, and until now, it hadn't been clear
which Americans had the potential to benefit from the added
healthcare coverage in states that participate," said Dr Tammy
Chang of the University of Michigan Medical School, whose study
appears in the Annals of Family Medicine.As of Aug. 1, 23 states and Washington had accepted the
expansion, while 21 states had turned it down, according to
consultants Avalere Health. A 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling
allowed states to opt out.Chang said a major concern for policy makers has been that
new Medicaid enrollees would be "just as sick or even sicker"
than the current Medicaid population. "What we found is, that is
not likely to be true," Chang said.In her study, Chang and her colleagues used the latest
nationally representative data from a federal study called the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which was done
between 2007 and 2010. They used the data from an estimated 13.8
million adult Medicaid beneficiaries and 13.6 million adults who
are potentially eligible for such coverage under ACA.The team compared characteristics such as age, sex,
race/ethnicity, education and various health measures, measured
body mass index, blood sugar levels, blood pressure, depression,
tobacco and alcohol use and other information gathered from a
questionnaire.According to the study, people who gain coverage under
Medicaid expansion will have an average age of 36 versus 38 for
the current Medicaid population.Some 49 percent will be male, versus 33 percent of the
current population, and 60 percent will be white, compared with
50 percent now.New enrollees also will be at least as healthy as, if not
healthier than, the current Medicaid population, having fewer
chronic diseases such as obesity and depression.Alcohol and smoking are the two biggest risk factors among
the new Medicaid class - nearly half are current smokers and
more than a third are moderate to heavy drinkers, far more than
the current Medicaid pool.The conclusions dovetail with a study published in June by
Sandra Decker of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention which found that low-income uninsured adults who
become eligible for Medicaid under the ACA are less likely to
have chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes
and high cholesterol.That study, also based on NHANES data, found that when
compared with those enrolled in Medicaid, uninsured adults
reported better overall health, were less likely to be obese and
less likely to report a physical, mental or emotional
limitation. They were also much less likely to have multiple
health problems.But because this group is uninsured, people with chronic
conditions such as diabetes or high cholesterol are less likely
to have them under control, suggesting that once they do get
coverage they are likely to need treatment.Sara Rosenbaum, a professor in the school of public health
at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who was not
involved in either study, said the findings suggest states that
expand Medicaid do not have to fear they will be "burdened with
the sickest, most costly, most disabled people in the state.""There will be some of them," she said. "But most very
disabled people who are poor already are on Medicaid because
they are classified as disabled."The ACA expands Medicaid coverage to otherwise ineligible
individuals and families who earn up to 138 percent of the
federal poverty line, or about $15,856 for a single adult and
$32,500 for a family of four this year.
