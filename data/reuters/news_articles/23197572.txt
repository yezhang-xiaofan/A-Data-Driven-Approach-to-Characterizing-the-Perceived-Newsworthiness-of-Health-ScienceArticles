 Nov 28 Eli Lilly's erectile
dysfunction drug Cialis can correct abnormal blood flow in
patients with a certain type of muscular dystrophy and could in
future be used to slow progression of the disorder, researchers
said on Wednesday.The findings suggest that while Cialis can't cure the
condition, known as Becker muscular dystrophy, it could be used
as a treatment to slow or prevent muscle weakening and help
patients retain more function for longer.Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is an inherited disorder
that involves slowly worsening muscle weakness of the legs and
pelvis. It is mostly found in boys and occurs in about 3 to 6
out of every 100,000 births.Patients with BMD often have difficulties with walking that
get worse over time. There is no cure for the condition, and by
the age of 25 to 30 many patients are unable to walk.In a small study involving men with the disorder,
researchers from the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles,
in the United States took measurements when volunteers' forearm
muscles were either rested or lightly exercised with a handgrip.They found that almost all the patients had defective blood
flow when they exercised. This lack of blood flow may contribute
to muscle fatigue and weakness, the researchers wrote in a study
in the journal Science Translational Medicine.But after giving some of the patients a single oral dose of
Cialis and comparing them to others given a placebo, or dummy
pill, the scientists found that normal blood flow was restored
to the muscles of 8 out of 9 patients who got the drug.Like other erectile dysfunction drugs, Cialis, known
generically as tadalafil, dilates blood vessels and is designed
to increase blood flow. In the impotence drug market, it is a
longer-acting alternative to Pfizer's blue pill, Viagra.Sales of Cialis for erectile dysfunction brought in $1.875
billion for Eli Lilly in 2011, up 10 percent on 2010.While using the drug in BMD may be a possibility in future,
the researchers cautioned that doctors should not prescribe it
for this indication until more, larger studies have been
conducted to show whether the improved blood flow has a
meaningful effect on dystrophic muscles.
