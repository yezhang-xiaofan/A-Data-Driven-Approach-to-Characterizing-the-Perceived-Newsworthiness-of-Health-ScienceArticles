n"&gt;Jan 24 Taking at least one aspirin every week is
linked to the development of age-related vision loss, according
to an Australian study that looked at information collected over
15 years.Currently, over 100 billion aspirin tablets are consumed
every year, the researchers wrote in JAMA Internal Medicine,
commonly used in the prevention of heart attacks or strokes.In 2011, a European study found that seniors who took a
daily aspirin were twice as likely to develop vision loss such
as macular degeneration, compared to those who did not -
prompting new study leader Jie Jin Wang into trying to confirm
its findings.Overall, Wang, from the University of Sydney, and her
colleagues had information on 2,389 people over 45. Of those,
257 said they took at least one aspirin every week.By the end of the study, 63 people had developed so-called
wet macular degeneration, the most severe form. A total of 5.8
percent of regular aspirin users developed the vision loss,
compared to 2.3 percent of people who did not regularly take
aspirin."Regular aspirin use is associated with increased risk of
incident neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration,
independent of a history of cardiovascular disease and smoking,"
Wang and her colleagues wrote.They warned, though, that there's still not enough evidence
to say taking aspirin leads to the condition."We still need to accumulate more evidence," Wang said.But in a commentary published with the study, Sanjay Kaul
and George Diamond cautioned that the study had limitations,
noting that previous studies had found mixed results when
looking at aspirin use and vision loss.They wrote that the evidence was not convincing enough for
doctors to change how they prescribe aspirin, especially with
its benefits in preventing heart attack and stroke."In the final analysis, decisions about aspirin use are best
made by balancing the risks against the benefit in context of
each individual's medical history and value judgment," they
wrote.Wang agreed that the findings are not strong enough to
support a change in clinical practice, but she said some doctors
may want to keep a closer watch on patients at higher risk for
macular degeneration who are also using aspirin.
