* Depression a major cause of illness worldwide* Antidepressants only work for some patients, sometimes* Experts say few patients are offered talking therapiesBy LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Patients with depression who fail
to benefit from antidepressant drugs may do better if they are
also treated with a type of "talking" psychotherapy called CBT,
according to new research published on Friday.In the first large-scale trial to test the effectiveness of
cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT, alongside medication for
depression, scientists said they found that the combination
works where drug treatment alone fails.Nicola Wiles of Bristol University's school of social and
community medicine, who led the study, said the findings
underline the need to increase the availability of therapy for
depressed patients."While there have been initiatives to increase access to CBT
in both the UK and Australia, worldwide initiatives are rare,"
she said in a statement.Wiles and colleagues recruited 469 adults from across
Britain who had not responded to at least 6 weeks of treatment
with an antidepressant. For the study, 235 patients continued
with their usual antidepressant medication, while 234 patients
got their usual care plus CBT and were followed up for 12
months.The results, published in The Lancet medical journal, showed
that after 6 months, 46 percent of those who got CBT as well as
their usual care had improved - reporting at least a 50 percent
reduction in their depressive symptoms. This compared to 22
percent of those who did not get CBT.Patients treated with CBT, which involves talking through
behaviours and ways of thinking with a trained psychotherapist
or psychologist, were also more likely to go into remission and
have fewer symptoms of anxiety, the researchers said. Similar
effects were reported at 12 months.Major depression affects around 20 percent of people at some
point in their lives. The World Health Organisation
(WHO)predicts that by 2020, depression will rival heart disease
as the health disorder with the highest global disease burden.While there are many antidepressants on the market,
including top sellers such as Prozac and Seroxat, it is widely
accepted that many antidepressants work in only half of patients
half of the time, and drugmakers are struggling to come up with
a new generation of drugs in this field.Willem Kuyken, a clinical psychology professor at Exeter
University who also worked on the study, said its results showed
that doctors and patients should be looking beyond drugs."This trial provides further evidence that psychological
treatments like cognitive therapy can provide substantive and
lasting help to people who suffer depression," he said.Wiles added, however, that even in wealthy countries such as
Britain, where there has been a recent push to invest more into
psychological therapies, many people who have not responded to
antidepressants still don't get the chance of trying intensive
CBT that take between 12 and 18 sessions.In the United States, only about a quarter of people with
depression have received any form of psychological therapy in
the last 12 months, she said.
