* Schizophrenia one of world's most common mental illnesses* Scans show disconnection between two key brain regions* Researchers hope findings will lead to new treatmentsBy LONDON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The delusions and other psychotic
symptoms experienced by people with schizophrenia may be caused
by a faulty brain "switch" that blurs their ability to
distinguish inner thoughts from objective reality, scientists
said on Wednesday.In a study published in the journal Neuron, researchers
found the severity of symptoms such as hearing voices and
delusions was due to a disconnection between two key regions of
the brain - the insula and the lateral frontal cortex.The finding, they said, could in future lead to the
development of better, more targeted treatments for
schizophrenia, with fewer side effects."In our daily life, we constantly switch between our inner,
private world and the outer, objective world," said Lena
Palaniyappan, of Nottingham University's psychiatry department,
who co-led the study."This switching action is enabled by the connections between
the insula and frontal cortex. (But) this switch process appears
to be disrupted in patients with schizophrenia."Schizophrenia is one of the most common serious psychiatric
disorders affecting around 1 in 100 people worldwide. Scientists
are not yet clear what causes it, but believe it could be a
combination of a genetic predisposition to the condition
combined with environmental factors.Drug use is known to be a key trigger - people who use
cannabis, or stimulant drugs, are three to four times more
likely to go on to develop recurrent psychotic symptoms.Researchers also think underdevelopment of the brain in the
womb and in early childhood could play a role in schizophrenia.SIDE-EFFECTSPrevious studies have found that schizophrenia patients have
unusually smooth "folding" patterns of the brain over the insula
region - suggesting this brain area may not have developed
normally.In this latest study, Palaniyappan's team used functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to compare the brains of
35 healthy volunteers with those of 38 schizophrenic patients.The results showed that whereas the majority of healthy
people were able to make the switch from inner thoughts to
external reality using the connections between the insula and
frontal cortex regions, the patients with schizophrenia were
less likely to shift to using their frontal cortex."This could explain why internal thoughts sometime appear as
external objective reality, experienced (by schizophrenia
patients) as voices or hallucinations," Palaniyappan said.She said it could also explain why people with schizophrenia
find it hard to take in external material pleasures - for
example to enjoy a social event or listening to music.Palaniyappan said that normally, the insular and frontal
cortex form a loop in the brain - with the insular stimulating
the frontal cortex while it in turn inhibits the insula - but in
patients with schizophrenia this system was found to be flawed.The study offers clues for the development of more effective
treatments for schizophrenia - which for now generally involve a
combination of antipsychotic drugs and psychological therapies.Although antipsychotic drugs can help some patients, many
find they do not work and often stop taking them in the longer
term because of their side-effects. Experts say that with
current treatments, only around 20 percent of patients with
schizophrenia achieve complete recovery.The team is looking at an experimental treatment technique
called transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, which uses a
magnetic pulse to stimulate malfunctioning brain regions.Palaniyappan said her results suggested the loop between the
insular and the frontal cortex could be targeted with TMS - with
a pulse delivered to the frontal lobe aimed at stimulating the
insula and resetting the "switching" capability.
