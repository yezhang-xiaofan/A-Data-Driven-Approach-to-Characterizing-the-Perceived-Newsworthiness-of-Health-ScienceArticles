* Genetic method creates male-only offspring* Malaria parasite spread by biting female mosquitoes* Some 627,000 people die each year from malaria* Hope is that new method could "crash" mosquito populationsBy LONDON, June 10 (Reuters) - Scientists have found a way of
genetically modifying mosquitoes to produce sperm that only
creates males, offering a potential fresh approach to fighting
and eventually eradicating malaria.Researchers from Imperial College London tested a genetic
method that distorts the sex ratio of Anopheles gambiae
mosquitoes, the main transmitters of the malaria parasite, so
that the female mosquitoes that bite and pass the disease to
humans are no longer produced.In a study published in the journal Nature Communications,
the team reported that in the first laboratory tests, the
technique created a fully fertile mosquito strain that produced
95 percent male offspring."For the very first time, we have been able to inhibit the
production of female offspring in the laboratory and this
provides a new means to eliminate the disease," said Andrea 
Crisanti, who led the research at Imperial's department of life
sciences.Nikolai Windbichler, who co-led the work, said what was most
promising about the results is that they are self-sustaining."Once modified mosquitoes are introduced, males will start
to produce mainly sons, and their sons will do the same, so
essentially the mosquitoes carry out the work for us," he said.In their experiments, which took more than six years, the
scientists inserted a DNA cutting enzyme called I-PpoI into
Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes.The enzyme works by cutting the DNA of the female-producing
X chromosome during production of sperm, so that almost no
functioning sperm carry it. As a result, the offspring of the
genetically modified mosquitoes was almost exclusively male.SIX GENERATIONSThe scientists introduced the genetically modified
mosquitoes to five caged wild-type mosquito populations. In four
of the five cages, this eliminated the entire population within
six generations due to the lack of females.The hope is that if this could be replicated in the wild,
this would ultimately cause the malaria-carrying mosquito
population to crash.Experts not directly involved in the work were impressed
with its results and enthusiastic about its potential."This is super cool work," said Michael Bonsall, a reader in
zoology at Britain's University of Oxford. "Reducing mating
potential of mosquitoes by modifying sperm is a population
suppression technology. It will be very exciting to see how this
... is now taken forward."Malaria kills some 627,000 people worldwide each year,
according to the World Health Organisation, and the vast
majority of its victims are babies and children in sub-Saharan
Africa.Malaria control has been threatened by the spread of
insecticide resistant mosquitoes and malaria parasites resistant
to drugs, and the WHO says more than 3.4 billion people remain 
at risk from contracting the disease."Malaria is debilitating and often fatal and we need to find
new ways of tackling it," said Crisanti. "We think our
innovative approach is a huge step forward."
