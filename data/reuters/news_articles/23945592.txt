* First genomic map of mutations that lead to tumours* Findings help explain mutations found in 30 cancer types* "Profound implications" for cancer treatment, preventionBy LONDON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Researchers in Britain have set
out the first comprehensive map of mutational processes behind
the development of tumours - work that should in future lead to
better ways to treat and prevent a wide range of cancers.In a study published in the journal Nature on Wednesday,
researchers who analysed more than 7,000 genomes, or genetic
codes, of common forms of cancer uncovered 21 so-called
"signatures" of processes that mutate DNA."(This) is an important step to discovering the processes
that drive cancer formation," said Serena Nik-Zainal of the
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute who worked on the research."Through detailed analysis, we can start to use the
overwhelming amounts of information buried deep in the DNA of
cancers to our advantage in terms of understanding how and why
cancers arise."All cancers are caused by mutations in DNA occurring in
cells of the body during someone's lifetime.Scientists are clear about some things, such as that
chemicals in tobacco smoke cause mutations in lung cells that
lead to lung cancers, or that ultraviolet light triggers
mutations in skin cells that lead to skin cancers.But they have yet to figure out the biological processes
that cause mutations behind most common cancers."We're beginning to know quite a lot about what the
consequences of those mutations are. But actually we have a
really rudimentary understanding of what is causing the
mutations in the first place," said Mike Stratton, the Sanger
Institute's director and the lead researcher on this study."And after all, the things that are causing those mutations
are the causes of cancer."The team analysed the genetic codes of 7,042 cases of cancer
in people from around the world, covering 30 different types of
the disease, to see if they could find patterns, or signatures,
of mutational processes.They discovered that all the cancers contained two or more
signatures - a finding that shows the variety of processes that
work together when a cancer develops.They also found that different cancers have different
numbers of mutational processes. While two mutational processes
underlie the development of ovarian cancer, there are six behind
the development of liver cancer, the researchers saidAnd some signatures are found in multiple cancer types,
while others are only found in one type. Out of the 30 cancers,
25 had signatures from mutational processes linked to ageing.In a suggestion of what might be behind many common cancers,
the team also discovered that a family of enzymes called
APOBECs, known to mutate DNA, was linked to more than half of
the cancer types studied.APOBECs can be activated when the body is responding to a
viral infection. The researchers said it may be that the
resulting "signatures" are collateral damage on the human genome
caused by the enzymes acting to protect cells from viruses.Stratton described the results as like uncovering the
"archaeological traces" of the many mutational processes that
lead to most cancers."This compendium of mutational signatures and the consequent
insights into the mutational processes underlying them has
profound implications for the understanding of cancer."(Editing by )
