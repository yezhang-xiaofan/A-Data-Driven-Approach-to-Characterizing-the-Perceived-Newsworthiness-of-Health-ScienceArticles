* Study criticises involvement in health policy* Says industry-sponsored research biased* Recommends more external regulationBy LONDON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Multinational food, drink and
alcohol companies are using strategies similar to those employed
by the tobacco industry to undermine public health policies,
health experts said on Tuesday.In an international analysis of involvement by so-called
"unhealthy commodity" companies in health policy-making,
researchers from Australia, Britain, Brazil and elsewhere said
self-regulation was failing and it was time the industry was
regulated more stringently from outside.The researchers said that through the aggressive marketing
of ultra-processed food and drink, multinational companies were
now major drivers of the world's growing epidemic of chronic
diseases such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes.Writing in The Lancet medical journal, the researchers cited
industry documents they said revealed how companies seek to
shape health legislation and avoid regulation.This is done by "building financial and institutional
relations" with health professionals, non-governmental
organisations and health agencies, distorting research findings,
and lobbying politicians to oppose health reforms, they said.They cited analysis of published research which found
systematic bias from industry funding: articles sponsored
exclusively by food and drinks companies were between four and
eight times more likely to have conclusions that favoured the
companies than those not sponsored by them."Regulation, or the threat of regulation, is the only way to
change these transnational corporations," wrote the researchers,
led by Rob Moodie from the University of Melbourne in Australia.Ian Gilmore, special adviser on alcohol to Britain's Royal
College of Physicians said the findings were "a final nail in
the coffin" of the idea that involving the alcohol industry in
public health measures could work."Any government serious about public health should in future
divorce its public health activities from industry involvement,"
Gilmore, who was not involved in study, said in a statement.Responding to the study's criticisms, UNESDA, which
represents the non-alcoholic drinks industry in Europe, said
experts recognise obesity has many causes including diet, lack
of exercise, genetics and lack of nutritional knowledge.It added that, within the EU, the European Commission had
opted to take a "multi-stakeholder approach gathering
governments, industry, the healthcare community and civil
society to work together to teach people how to eat better, take
more exercise and lead healthy, balanced lifestyles".The researchers said, however, that their evidence showed
this collaborative approach had failed. They recommended that,
in future, food, drinks and tobacco firms should have no role in
national or international policies on chronic diseases.Instead, they proposed a system of "public regulation" which
they said would focus on directly pressuring industry by
"raising awareness of their shady practices and maintaining
active public pressure".
