 Jan 29 In experiments that could open a
new era in stem cell biology, scientists have found a cheap and
easy way to reprogramme mature cells from mice back into an
embryonic-like state that allowed them to generate many types of
tissue.The research, described as game-changing by experts in the
field, suggests human cells could in future be reprogrammed by
the same technique, offering a simpler way to replace damaged
cells or grow new organs for sick and injured people.Chris Mason, chair of regenerative medicine bioprocessing at
University College London, who was not involved in the work,
said its approach was "the most simple, lowest-cost and quickest
method" to generate so-called pluripotent cells - able to
develop into many different cell types - from mature cells."If it works in man, this could be the game changer that
ultimately makes a wide range of cell therapies available using
the patient's own cells as starting material - the age of
personalised medicine would have finally arrived," he said.The experiments, reported in two papers in the journal
Nature on Wednesday, involved scientists from the RIKEN Center
for Developmental Biology in Japan and Brigham and Women's
Hospital and Harvard Medical School in the United States.Beginning with mature, adult cells, researchers let them
multiply and then subjected them to stress "almost to the point
of death", they explained, by exposing them to various events
including trauma, low oxygen levels and acidic environments.Within days, the scientists found that the cells survived
and recovered from the stressful stimulus by naturally reverting
into a state similar to that of an embryonic stem cell.These stem cells created by this exposure to stresses -
dubbed STAP cells by the researchers - were then able to
differentiate and mature into different types of cells and
tissue, depending on the environments they were given."If we can work out the mechanisms by which differentiation
states are maintained and lost, it could open up a wide range of
possibilities for new research and applications using living
cells," said Haruko Obokata, who lead the work at RIKEN.Stem cells are the body's master cells and are able to
differentiate into all other types of cells. Scientists say
that, by helping to regenerate tissue, they could offer ways of
tackling diseases for which there are currently only limited
treatments - including heart disease, Parkinson's and stroke.There are two main types of stem cells: embryonic ones,
harvested from embryos, and adult or iPS cells, which are taken
from skin or blood and reprogrammed back into stem cells.Because the harvesting of embryonic stem cells requires the
destruction of a human embryo, the technique has been the
subject of ethical concerns and protests from pro-life
campaigners.Dusko Ilic, a reader in stem cell science at Kings College
London, said the Nature studies described "a major scientific
discovery" and predicted their findings would open "a new era in
stem cell biology"."Whether human cells would respond in a similar way to
comparable environmental cues ... remains to be shown," he said
in an emailed comment. "I am sure that the group is working on
this and I would not be surprised if they succeed even within
this calendar year."
