* International team visited Saudi Arabia* 38 people killed since new coronovirus emerged late 2012* Nine infected patients received dialysis at same hospitalBy LONDON, June 19 (Reuters) - The new Middle East coronavirus
that has killed 38 people after emerging late last year is a
serious risk in hospitals because it is easily transmitted in
healthcare environments, infectious disease experts said on
Wednesday.In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
the researchers said the Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS)was not only easily transmitted from patient to patient,
but also from the transfer of sick patients to other hospitals.Nine infected patients in Saudi Arabia had received dialysis
treatment at the same hospital, some at the same time.The international investigative team of specialists, who
went to Saudi Arabia to analyse the outbreak in May, said it was
even more deadly than a similar outbreak of SARS, or severe
acute respiratory syndrome, in Canadian hospitals in 2003.MERS is related to SARS because the virus that causes it is
from the same coronavirus family.The MERS virus, which can cause coughing, fever and
pneumonia, has spread from the Gulf to France, Germany, Italy,
Tunisia and Britain. The World Health Organisation puts the
latest global toll at 38 deaths from a total of 64
laboratory-confirmed cases.The team, which included Saudi, Canadian and other
scientists, was invited by Saudi officials to help investigate
the outbreak in several Saudi hospitals.For the study, they compared it to an outbreak of SARS in
Toronto in 2003 which the same team had also investigated.Trish Perl, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine in the United States and a member of the
international team, said the investigation "showed some
surprising similarities between MERS and SARS"."Both are very deadly viruses and easily transferred between
people, and even between healthcare facilities," she said in a
statement about their findings.PATIENTS TRANSFERREDInitially, 23 people in Saudi Arabia were infected with MERS
at the time of the investigation, and 11 died. Saudi health
officials now put the death toll at 32, with another 49
infected.Among the 23 infected initially, five were family members
and two were health care workers, the researchers said.As well as the nine infected patients on dialysis, another
dialysis patient had been transferred between units at different
hospitals, where others became infected.Eight other infected patients were transferred between
facilities or hospitals - a factor the researchers said probably
led to more patients becoming exposed.The team did not say specifically why MERS was a serious
risk in hospitals, but wards are often high risk areas for the
spread of infections because sick people with weakened immune
systems are vulnerable to bugs and viruses being inadvertently
spread by health workers caring for multiple patients."The story of how this outbreak occurred and how this virus
was transmitted became very clear once we started to lay out the
evidence," said Perl."(We) saw that one infected patient had been in the hospital
at the same time as another infected patient, and this patient
was transferred to another hospital, where another patient
became infected shortly thereafter."Among the team's major findings was that MERS, even with
relatively fewer people infected than in the SARS outbreak, had
a death rate many times higher than SARS, at 48 percent and 8
percent, respectively.The researchers noted, however, that the MERS death rate may
come down if more cases are identified, including cases in
people with milder symptoms.
