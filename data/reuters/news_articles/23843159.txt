* Poor diet is No. 1 risk factor for ill-health* Many live longer, but in painBy CHICAGO, July 10 (Reuters) - The United States is falling
behind its economic peers in most measures of health, despite
making gains in the past two decades, according to a sweeping
study of data from 34 countries.Although Americans are living longer, with overall U.S. life
expectancy increasing to 78.2 in 2010 from 75.2 in 1990,
increases in psychiatric disorders, substance abuse and
conditions that cause back, muscle and joint pain mean many do
not feel well enough to enjoy those added years of life."Despite a level of health expenditures that would have
seemed unthinkable a generation ago, the health of the U.S.
population has improved only gradually and has fallen behind the
pace of progress in many other wealthy nations," Dr. Harvey
Fineberg of the Institute of Medicine in Washington, D.C., wrote
in an editorial published on Wednesday with the study in the
Journal of the American Medical Association.The study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation
at the University of Washington in Seattle is the first
comprehensive analysis of disease burden in the United States in
more than 15 years. It includes estimates for death and
disability from 291 diseases, conditions, and injuries as well
as 67 risk factors.It is one of three new papers by the institute being
released simultaneously at the request of first lady Michelle
Obama, who plans to present the findings to mayors of U.S.
cities in an invitation-only event at the White House as part of
her campaign to improve the nation's health.They add to a growing pile of research showing that despite
lavish spending on healthcare in the United States, Americans
are failing to make significant gains in many measures of
overall health.In a 2010 report by the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund, the
United States, despite spending twice as much on healthcare,
came in dead last compared with six peers - Britain, Canada,
Germany, Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand.'MEDIOCRE' HEALTHThe latest study in JAMA compared 20 years of health data
from a vast number of surveys, published studies and death
certificates in the United States with similar records in 34
high-income countries in Europe, Asia and North America.Overall, the United States fell in the rankings between 1990
and 2010 on nearly every major health measure."Compared to other high-income countries, U.S. health
outcomes are pretty mediocre," said Dr. Christopher Murray,
director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at
the University of Washington, who led the study.the researchers identified the leading causes of diseases,
injuries and risk factors associated with disease over the past
two decades. They found top causes of premature death in the
United States still include heart disease, lung cancer and
stroke, but suicide and road injuries also ranked among the
leading causes of early deaths in the United States.Among the leading diseases, the team found "a big and
somewhat under recognized volume of disability in the U.S. that
is related to bone and joint disease - things like low back pain
- as well as mental disorders and substance abuse," Murray said.As for the top risk factors that lead to ill-health, a poor
diet is the No. 1 cause, followed by tobacco, obesity and high
blood pressure, he said.Those may help explain why the United States consistently
gets poor marks on these kinds of studies, Murray said.KENTUCKY, GEORGIA, FLORIDA GETTING FITIn addition to comparing the United States with other
countries, the team also compared various counties within the
United States in a pair of studies focused on obesity and
physical activity.Those studies, published in the journal Population Health
Metrics, found rising obesity rates in nearly all of the
hundreds of U.S. counties it studied between 2001 and 2009, but
they also found that many Americans are becoming more physically
active.Counties in Kentucky, Georgia and Florida all reported major
increases in the number of people getting sufficient physical
activity, which the team defined as 150 total minutes of
moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week.For men, Concho County, Texas, proved to have the biggest
increases in physical activity, with the ratio of men getting
adequate exercise rising to 58.2 percent in 2009 from 41.4
percent in 2001.For women, the biggest increase occurred in Morgan County,
Kentucky, where the ratio of women getting adequate exercise
rose to 44 percent from 25.7 percent."Understanding local trends in obesity and physical activity
in both rural and urban areas will help communities develop
successful strategies and learn from one another," said Dr. Ali
Mokdad of the University of Washington, who worked on both of
the studies.
