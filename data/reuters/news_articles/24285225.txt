* Report says limited access to key drugs "a global scandal"* Opioids such as morphine and oxycodon are highly addictive* Without opioids, cancer patients face excruciating painBy LONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - A "pandemic of over-regulation"
of opioid-based painkillers such as morphine and fentanyl means
billions of cancer patients around the world suffer intolerable
pain, researchers said on Thursday.Describing what they said was a "scandal of global
proportions", researchers from the Global Opioid Policy
Initiative (GOPI) said governments that over-regulate should
consider the unintended consequences of restricting access to
medicines and change their approach.More than 4 billion people live in countries - many of them
in emerging and developing regions - where regulations, often
imposed over the risk of addiction to the drugs, leave the
patients in excruciating pain, they wrote in a global analysis
published in the Annals of Oncology journal."This is a tragedy born out of good intentions," said Nathan
Cherny, from Israel's Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem,
who led the study."When opioids are over-regulated, the precautionary measures
to prevent abuse and diversion are excessive and impair the
ability of healthcare systems to relieve real suffering."The study, conducted in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Latin
America and the Caribbean looked at the availability of the
seven opioid medications considered by the World Health
Organisation to be essential for the relief of cancer pain."The GOPI study has uncovered a pandemic of over-regulation
in much of the developing world that is making it
catastrophically difficult to provide basic medication to
relieve strong cancer pain," Cherny said."Most of the world's population lacks the necessary access
to opioids for cancer pain management and palliative care, as
well as acute, post-operative, obstetric and chronic pain."The drugs studied were codeine, oral oxycodone, transdermal
fentanyl, immediate and slow release oral morphine, injectable
morphine and oral methadone.As well as being very effective painkillers, opioids are
highly addictive. One of the best-known is Oxycontin, a
long-acting form of oxycodone which is often linked with tales
of drug addiction among celebrities in the United States.U.S. drug regulators said in September that labels on
long-acting opioids should contain stronger warnings
highlighting the dangers of addiction and abuse.Yet the situation in other countries is very different.The GOPI study found that while there were problems with the
supply of opioids in many countries, the main problem was the
over-regulation, making it difficult for doctors to prescribe
and administer them for legitimate medical use.James Cleary of the Palliative Medicine at the University of
Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, who co-led the study, said
regulatory reform should be coupled with education of health
workers about safe and responsible use of opioid drugs."The next step is for international and local organisations
working alongside governments and regulators to thoughtfully
address the problems," he said.The authors pointed to Ukraine as one example of a country
which used to have very restrictive laws but is now reforming
its policy to improve access to opioids.
