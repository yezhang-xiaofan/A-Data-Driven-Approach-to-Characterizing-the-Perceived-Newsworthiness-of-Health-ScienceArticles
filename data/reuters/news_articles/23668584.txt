* Decline in premature death rates lags behind other nations* Alzheimer's, alcohol and drug abuse cause much ill-health* Experts call for bold action by politicians

 (Adds reaction, details of journal publication)By LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - Years of universal healthcare,
rising health spending, cancer screening, immunisation and
anti-smoking laws have failed to stop Britain falling behind its
peers in reducing early death and disease, a study showed on
Tuesday.Researchers who compared Britain's health performance since
1990 with 14 European Union countries plus Australia, Canada,
Norway and the United States said its pace of decline in
premature death was "persistently and significantly" behind the
average - a finding they described as "startling".Chris Murray, who led the work at the University of
Washington, said Britain's poor performance was partly due to
dramatic increases in Alzheimer's disease and in drug and
alcohol abuse problems, and to a failure to tackle leading
killers such as heart disease, strokes and lung diseases."Concerted action is urgently needed," said Murray, director
of the university's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation,
whose study was published in the medical journal The Lancet.Using data from a vast study called the Global Burden of
Diseases, headline findings of which were published last year,
researchers analysed patterns of ill health and death in
Britain, calculated the contribution of various preventable risk
factors, and ranked it among high-income countries that spent
similar amounts on health in 1990 and 2010.They found that only in men older than 55 years had seen
significantly faster drops in death rates than other nations
over the last 20 years.Britain's ranking in premature mortality rates for adults
aged between 20 and 54 had "worsened substantially", they found.This was partly due to dramatic growth in problems linked to
drugs and alcohol, which were ranked among the least important
causes of death in this age group in 1990 - ranked 32nd and 43rd
respectively - but rose to sixth and 18th place in 2010."WAKE-UP CALL"Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wellbeing at Public
Health England, who worked with Murray on the study, said the
findings were "both a wake-up call and an opportunity"."While it's encouraging that overall the health of the UK
has improved substantially since the last report, the pace of
improvement is not enough," he said in a statement.The study found Britain's eight leading causes of death have
changed little in the last 20 years, with heart disease, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, lung cancer and lower
respiratory infections remaining the top five.There has been a startling increase Alzheimer's disease  -
which rose from 24th to 10th place - in cirrhosis, which is
linked to alcohol abuse, and in drug use disorders. They rose
from 14th to 9th position and from 64th to 21st respectively.Andrew Chidgey of the Alzheimer's Society said he was sad
but not surprised by the findings on rising cases of the
brain-wasting condition. "With numbers soaring and costs
trebling, we need urgent action to find more effective
treatments," he said.The study found that in 2010, Britain had significantly
lower premature death rates from diabetes, road injuries, liver
cancer and chronic kidney disease on average than other nations.But it had not kept pace on rates of early death from other
conditions such as heart and lung diseases, breast and
oesophageal cancer and pre-term birth complications.Commenting on the findings, Edmund Jessop from the UK
Faculty of Public Health in London said there was "plenty of
room for bold action by politicians".He said ministers should introduce tighter health policies
such as plain packaging for cigarettes, a minimum price for
alcohol, a ban on trans fats, improved control of hypertension
and a greater focus on psychiatric disorders."Alternatively, the UK can continue to languish at the
bottom of European league tables," he said.
