n"&gt;May 9 The number of teenagers who have
experienced mania, a hallmark of bipolar disorder, is close to
the number of adults estimated to have the mood disorder,
suggesting that for many the condition begins during
adolescence, according to a U.S. study."The traditional wisdom has been that mania begins in your
20s and 30s," said Kathleen Ries Merikangas, the study's lead
author and chief of the genetic epidemiology branch at the
National Institute of Mental Health."I think the important thing is for people to recognize that
mania does occur in adolescents."The most common definition of bipolar disorder includes
alternate cycles of mania and depression, though one type of
bipolar diagnosis involves mania alone.The study, published in the Archives of General Psychiatry,
included more than 10,000 teenagers who went through extensive
interviews about their moods and behavior.The researchers found that 2.5 percent met the criteria for
having had mania and depression, and 2.2 percent of teens had
experienced it within the last 12 months.Also, within the year preceding the survey, 1.3 percent of
the teens had mania alone and 5.7 percent had depression.According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 2.6
percent of adults have had bipolar disorder in the last 12
months."I think our data suggest that bipolar disorder is more
common in adolescents than previous studies had shown,"
Merikangas told Reuters Health.She said it could be because the questions used during the
interviews were somewhat broader than what earlier surveys had
asked, but all the teens considered to have a mood disorder in
her study met the criteria for diagnosis in the DSM-IV, the
standard diagnostic manual for psychiatry."This (study) confirms the impression that onset in
adolescents is part of the picture for this disorder for many,
many patients," said Robert Finding, director of the division of
child and adolescent psychiatry at University Hospitals Case
Medical Center in Cleveland, who was not involved with the
study.The mood disorders also became more common as the teens got
older, with 1.4 percent of 13 and 14-year-olds meeting the
criteria for mania - but nearly twice as many 17 and 18 year
olds had the disorder.About one out of every five teens with mania and depression
had made a suicide attempt, and more than half had an anxiety or
behavioral disorder as well.Experts said that the study results don't necessarily
suggest that the rates of bipolar symptoms in teens are rising
but more likely that increasing numbers of teens who seek
treatment for a psychiatric problem are being diagnosed with
bipolar disorder."The take home message is that adolescence is when we really
see bipolar disorder begin, so we should shift our focus of
prevention and intervention earlier in the lifespan," Merikangas
said.
