* Studies show children in same-sex families do 'fine'* Nearly 2 million kids raised by gay, lesbian parentsBy  and Genevra PittmanWASHINGTON/NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - Gay and lesbian
couples should be able to get married for the health and
well-being of their children and families, the nation's leading
group for pediatricians said on Thursday in a policy statement
that also backs adoption rights.The American Academy of Pediatrics, in calling on the legal
right for same-sex couples to marry, said children's well-being
is affected far more by other factors such as their parents'
health and economic security than their sexual orientation."It is better that children have two parents than one
parent, and assuming that these parents love each other and love
the child and have economic and social security and stability,
then that's the critical ingredient for the optimal growth and
development of the child," said Dr. Benjamin Siegel, head of an
AAP committee that studied the issue.Siegel said the academy's board of directors voted
unanimously for the organization, which represents 60,000
pediatricians, to support same-sex marriage as well as the right
for gay parents to adopt or foster children."We need to have laws and regulations that support families
to nurture children," said Siegel, a pediatrician at Boston
Medical Center and the Boston University School of Medicine.The U.S. Supreme Court is preparing to take up two major gay
rights cases next week, one on federal benefits for same-sex
married couples and another on California's law defining
marriage as between a man and a woman.Recent Reuters/Ipsos polls have found a majority of
Americans support same-sex marriage and access to federal
benefits such as such as tax exemptions for a surviving spouse's
inheritance.Close to 2 million American children already are being raised
by gay and lesbian parents, according to the pediatric group.THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHTThe group previously backed allowing a biological parent's
partner to adopt a child and allowing same-sex spouses to
receive federal benefits.But its new statement, published in the journal Pediatrics, 
 is based on more recent data showings kids do just as well when
they are raised by parents of the same or different genders."Scientific evidence affirms that children have similar
developmental and emotional needs and receive similar parenting
whether they are raised by parents of the same or different
genders," AAP said, citing research over the last 30 years.One 2010 study in the journal Pediatrics found teenagers
with lesbian moms performed better in school and had fewer
social problems, for example, when compared to teens with a
mother and father ().Some gay rights opponents have questioned the long-term
effects of gay marriage on children."There cannot yet be decisive evidence," George Will, a
conservative columnist, wrote in The Washington Post last week
about whether same-sex marriage was harmful.Nine states and Washington, D.C., have legalized same-sex
marriage. Public and political support for marriage equality has
grown in recent years and on Monday, former Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton became the latest politician to come out in
favor of same-sex marriage.The pediatrician's group said marriage, not civil unions, is
key because it offers families stronger economic security and
helps avoid issues of discrimination, intolerance and inequality
that can affect parents' self-esteem. Various state laws on
adoption by gay and lesbian parents are also "an inconsistent
patchwork," it added.In Massachusetts, where same-sex marriage has been legal
since 2004, Siegel sees broad acceptance of kids with gay or
lesbian parents."My experience is that parents are happier (and) the kids
are fine," he said.
