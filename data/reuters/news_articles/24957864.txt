* Schizophrenia affects around 1 in 100 people worldwide* Cannabis use among people with schizophrenia is high* Researchers say this may be down to common genetic risksBy LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - Genes that increase the risk of
a person developing schizophrenia may also increase the chance
they will use cannabis, researchers said on Tuesday after
studying more than 1,000 users of the drug.The results chime with previous studies linking
schizophrenia and cannabis, but suggest the association may be
due to common genes and might not be a causal relationship where
cannabis use leads to increased schizophrenia risk.Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in the world,
and its use is higher among people with schizophrenia than in
the general population."We know that cannabis increases the risk of schizophrenia.
Our study certainly does not rule this out, but it suggests that
there is likely to be an association in the other direction as
well - that a pre-disposition to schizophrenia also increases
your likelihood of cannabis use," said Robert Power, who led the
study at the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London.Schizophrenia is a common and severe psychiatric disorder
that affects around one in 100 people. People who use cannabis
are about twice as likely as those who do not to develop it.The disorder typically begins in late adolescence or early
adulthood and its most common symptoms are disruptions in
thinking, language and perception. It often includes psychotic
experiences, such as hearing voices or delusions.While the exact cause is unknown, research to date suggests
a combination of physical, genetic, psychological and
environmental factors can make people more likely to develop it.Previous studies have found a number of genetic risk
variants associated with schizophrenia, each of which slightly
increases a person's risk of developing the condition.Cannabis use has frequently been associated with it, but
there is much debate about whether this is because of a direct
cause, or whether there may be shared genes which predispose
people to both cannabis use and schizophrenia.A study published in March 2011 found that people who use
cannabis in their youth dramatically increase their risk of
psychotic symptoms, and that continued use of the drug can raise
the risk of developing a psychotic disorder in later life.And earlier research found that young people who smoke
cannabis for six years or more are twice as likely to have
psychotic episodes, hallucinations or delusions.This latest study, published in the journal Molecular
Psychiatry on Tuesday, included 2,082 healthy people of whom
1,011 had used cannabis. Each participant's genetic risk profile
- the number of genes related to schizophrenia each of them
carried - was measured.The researchers found that people genetically predisposed to
schizophrenia were more likely to use cannabis, and to use it in
greater amounts than those who had no schizophrenia risk genes.Power said the result "highlights the complex interactions
between genes and environments" when it comes to cannabis as a
risk factor for schizophrenia."Certain environmental risks, such as cannabis use, may be
more likely given an individual's innate behaviour and
personality, itself influenced by their genetic make-up," he
said, adding that this finding was important to consider when
calculating the economic and health impact of cannabis.
