 May 21 A Florida scientist
studying simple sea animals called comb jellies has found the
road map to a new form of brain development that could lead to
treatments for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and other
neurodegenerative diseases."There is more than one way to make a brain," University of
Florida researcher Leonid Moroz, who led an international
research team, told Reuters.Moroz said his research, published on Wednesday in a report
in the magazine Nature, also places comb jelly-like creatures on
the first branch of the animal kingdom's "tree of life,"
replacing and bumping up sponge-like species from the bottom
rung of evolutionary progression.Moroz said that finding should lead to a reclassification of
the animal kingdom's "tree of life" and reshape two centuries of
zoological thought.Comb jellies are different from common jellyfish.Moroz said his team found that comb jellies' molecular
makeup and the way they developed was radically different -
although still complex - from all other animals, involving
different genes and neural transmitters.Traditional scientific reasoning has held that simple nerve
nets evolved all the way up to a human level of complexity along
a single path. But it now appears that comb jellies took a
different route, using neurochemical language that does not
exist in other animals."All other animals have the same chemical language and these
guys have completely different language. It's not only different
grammar. It's a different alphabet," Moroz said.Comb jellies, for example, don't use dopamine, implicated in
Parkinson's disease, to control brain activity. They also can
regenerate their brains in less than four days. In one
experiment, a comb jelly regenerated its brain four times."Now we know we can construct neural systems differently,"
Moroz said.Moroz said degenerative brain diseases typically can be
treated to stall progression but not reversed.Discovering the key to regeneration, or appropriating the
comb jellies' different chemical languages, could lead to
advancements in synthetic and regenerative medicine, he said.
