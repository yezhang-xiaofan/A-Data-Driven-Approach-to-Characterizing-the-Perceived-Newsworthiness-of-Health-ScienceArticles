n"&gt;Jan 11 Heart attacks are usually most common on
weekdays and mornings, especially Mondays, but the pattern
reversed in New Orleans after it was devastated by Hurricane
Katrina, according to a U.S. study."The fact that it's such a polar opposite shift is really
surprising," said lead author Matthew Peters at Tulane
University in New Orleans.After the 2005 storm, the overall number of attacks tripled,
likely due to an increased number of smokers. Attacks were more
likely on weekday evenings and weekends, according to data
published in the American Journal of Cardiology.Before the hurricane, 23 percent of heart attacks happened
on Mondays, in line with national averages. This fell to 10
percent after the storm, less than on any other day of the week.Previous research has attributed the usual excess of Monday
and morning heart attacks to work stress, which also peaks on
Monday and in the morning, but researchers were puzzled to find
the pattern reversed after Katrina."Studies before have looked at the overall increase in
(heart attack) after disasters, like the earthquake in Japan and
Katrina, but this is the first time we've looked at the timing,"
Peters said.If the result holds up after further study, the authors
offer a tentative explanation: sources of stress change in a
city following a major disaster.Peters suggests that for people put out of work by the
storm, Mondays stopped being especially draining. For those
still working, a job became a welcome break from stresses of
hurricane related fallout at home."People aren't getting up and going to work, and home lives
are even more difficult," Peters said.But the idea of "stress relief at work" doesn't account for
all the findings, said David Krantz, who studies stress induced
heart attacks at Uniformed Services University of the Health
Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland.Morning heart attacks have been attributed to hormone shifts
and increased strain on the heart while waking up, which
wouldn't be affected by a hurricane, said Krantz.Data were limited to one medical center, Tulane University
Hospital. A previous study based on data from the same hospital
found that after the storm, more heart attack patients lacked
insurance, had temporary housing, were divorced and failed to
regularly take prescribed medications."(The study) doesn't confirm yet that experiencing the storm
changed people, the storm may simply have changed who remained
in town," said Kathryn Roecklein, who studies the influence of
body rhythms on biology at the University of Pittsburgh.Katrina displaced 1.3 million Gulf Coast households, who
were dispersed through all 50 states, temporarily or
permanently."A disaster that doesn't cause people to move away from the
area might make for a better test of this question," she added.The study also did not take into account other factors that
changed. Post-Katrina patients were on average younger, more
unemployed, less likely to be insured and more likely to smoke,
which is a sizeable risk factor for heart attack. These changes
might have influenced the shift in heart attack timing, but
Krantz said it's difficult to tell.
