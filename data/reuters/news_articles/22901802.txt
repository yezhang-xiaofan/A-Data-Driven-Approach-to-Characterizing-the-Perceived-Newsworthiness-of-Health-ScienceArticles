* Hormone-free drug made male mice infertile in treatment* Drug effects proved reversible* Did not appear to reduce sex driveBy CHICAGO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. researchers have stumbled
on a compound that may finally lead to a birth control pill for
men.In lab experiments, male mice given the pill were rendered
completely infertile during treatment as they produced fewer and
less mobile sperm. The drug, originally tested as part of a
broader cancer research project, does not affect the hormone
system or sex drive, the team said on Thursday."There is no effect on the mouse's mojo. The animals exhibit
the normal sexual behaviors and frequency of copulation," said 
Dr. James Bradner of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston,
whose study appears in the journal Cell.What's more, the effect is completely reversible. Once
doctors stopped giving the drug to mice, they were able to sire
healthy litters, with no apparent side effects, Bradner said.Scientists say the research is exciting because it applies a
unique approach to the problem of male contraception, which is
now largely comprised of less reliable methods like condom use,
or more permanent procedures like vasectomies.Bradner's lab focuses on developing new drugs to undermine
the molecular memory of cancer cells that tell them to divide.
Those memory markers are distributed throughout the genome, the
DNA that makes up a person's genetic code, and Bradner likens
them to post-it notes that give cells instructions.The team was experimenting with a compound developed in
Bradner's lab called JQ1, which was originally synthesized at
Dana-Farber to block BRD4, a cancer-causing gene.They discovered that it appears to target a protein specific
to the testes called BRDT that instructs sperm to mature.
Bradner said the compound does not appear to do damage to
sperm-making cells, but they forget how to create mature sperm
while under the influence of the drug.DRUG IMPEDES SPERM PRODUCTIONBradner reached out to reproductive health expert Martin
Matzuk of Baylor College of Medicine, another author of the
report, and his team tested the compound in mice.What they found is that the animals began producing fewer
sperm, and the ones they did produce were poor swimmers."When the drug is removed, these instructions return,"
Bradner said.The finding was surprising because few drugs are able to
cross a protective firewall known as the blood-testes barrier
that protects the testicles from substances floating around in
the blood stream.William Bremner from the University of Washington in
Seattle, who was not involved in the research, said in a
commentary the finding was "a breakthrough new approach," noting
that there has not been a new reversible contraceptive for men
since the development of the condom centuries ago."It's exciting basic science that provides a new approach to
think about how a contraceptive for men might be designed,"
Bremner said in a telephone interview. "At the same time, it's a
long ways from being in clinical trials in men, let alone being
on pharmacy shelves."Other teams have developed hormonal pills that are
effective, but they disrupt hormone balance in men, and drug
companies so far have not picked up on this approach, Bremner
said.Professor Moira O'Bryan, head of the Male Infertility and
Germ Cell Biology Laboratory at Monash University in Australia,
said the study was "an exciting report that could have major
scientific and social impacts."O'Bryan said the strong similarity between sperm production
in mice and humans suggest that a variation of the drug may
ultimately result in a human contraception for men.Bradner said his team is working to refine the drug so that
it only acts on cells in the testes, and not on cancer cells.And while there are many more tests ahead before it can be a
drug, the researchers believe the new approach can be
"completely translated to men, providing a novel and efficacious
strategy for a male contraceptive."
