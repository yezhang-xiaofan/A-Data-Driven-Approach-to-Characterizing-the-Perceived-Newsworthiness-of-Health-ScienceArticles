 May 23 A headline-making paper last
week announcing that scientists had, for the first time, cloned
human embryos and harvested stem cells from them contains minor
errors, the authors acknowledged on Thursday. The mistakes
raised questions about how well the journal that published the
paper vetted it but probably do not undermine the study's
central claim.In a statement, the journal, Cell, said "there were some
minor errors" in the paper, but "we do not believe these errors
impact the scientific findings of the paper."An anonymous commenter on the website PubPeer, where
scientists discuss papers after they have been published, first
pointed out problems with the paper, which drew extensive media
coverage.Even before the errors were spotted, however, there was
concern among experts not involved in the study that Cell had
rushed publication. It received the manuscript on April 30,
tapped outside scientists to review it in the standard process
called peer review, asked the authors to make revisions based on
that review and accepted the paper on May 3.When Reuters asked about the short turnaround time last
week, Cell spokeswoman Mary Beth O'Leary said the paper
"underwent a rigorous peer review and editorial process."Outside experts disagree.A three-day review process "is almost impossibly fast," said
cell biologist Jim Woodgett of Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto,
Canada. "To have a paper like this received, reviewed, revised
and accepted so quickly is very, very unusual."In a statement on Thursday, Cell referred to "the
preeminence of the reviewers" (whom it would not identify) and
said it has "no reason to doubt the thoroughness or rigor of the
review process." The rapid turnaround was possible because the
reviewers "graciously agreed to prioritize" the paper.DOLLY REDUXThe paper described how scientists led by biologist
Shoukhrat Mitalipov of Oregon Health &amp; Science University
accomplished what others had failed to: "therapeutic cloning" in
humans.That procedure begins with a human egg. The Oregon
scientists removed its genetic material, or DNA, then took an
adult skin cell and fused it with the egg. The DNA in the skin
cell took over, causing the egg to begin developing as if it had
been fertilized.This "somatic cell nuclear transfer" was used to clone Dolly
the sheep in 1996. But in this case, the goal was not a human
being; Mitalipov said last week that scientists would not
implant the dividing embryo into a womb so that it could develop
into a baby. Instead, the aim was a dishful of stem cells, which
can morph into any of the 200-plus cells in the human body and
might be used therapeutically, such as to replace cells lost to
degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's.After a few days, the human embryo contained exactly that:
stem cells that the Oregon scientists could use to start cell
lines.The errors in the Cell paper involve photographs and data
plots, something OHSU spokeman Jim Newman told Reuters was "an
editing error, not issues with the research or the data itself."OHSU agrees that there were some minor errors made when
preparing the figures for initial submission," Newman said,
adding that the university does not believe the errors "impact
the scientific findings of the paper in any way. We also do not
believe there was any wrongdoing."In one case, an image described as a cloned stem-cell colony
is reproduced in another image, where it is labeled an embryonic
stem-cell line derived from in vitro fertilization (IVF), not
cloning.Mitalipov told the journal Nature that the label is wrong,
and that another labeling mistake explained other duplicated
images.Another error was in images purporting to show that the
genes that are turned on in stem cells derived from the cloned
embryo (such as genes that make a cell a neuron) are similar to
those in stem cells taken from IVF embryos, considered the gold
standard for embryonic stem cells. The point was that the stem
cells taken from the cloned embryos are true stem cells.The problem, said the anonymous reviewer on PubPeer, is that
the two images - genes activated in IVF stem cells and in clone
stem cells - are suspiciously identical. Mitalipov said one
image used the wrong data, and that he and his team are
correcting it.While the mistakes seem innocent, they raised concerns among
stem-cell researchers because the field has been struck by fraud
in the past. In 2004 scientists led by Woo Suk Hwang of Seoul
National University claimed to have produced human embryonic
stem cells through the same technique used by the Oregon team.Their paper, published in Science, turned out to contain
fabricated data. That came to light when scientists figured out
that some of the images in the paper were copied or manipulated."When I read the Hwang paper, I didn't find any glaring
problems" at first, stem-cell biologist George Daley of the
Harvard Stem Cell Institute said, explaining how difficult it is
to spot fraud."I am waiting to learn more, but there is a difference
between errors in photomicrographs and fraudulent production of
cell lines," he said.So far, most scientists' ire is being directed at Cell more
than the Oregon researchers."To thoroughly evaluate the claims requires delving into the
data, and you can't expect people to do that in a day or two,"
said Mount Sinai's Woodgett, referring to peer review. "You're
forcing them to be superficial."Science journals compete intensely for "hot" papers, which
can translate into headlines, subscriptions and advertising.
Cell is published by Elsevier, a division of Reed Elsevier
.Six years ago, Nature held up by six months a paper by
Mitalipov in which his team used the Dolly method to clone
monkey embryos, the journal reported on Wednesday. Scientists
sometimes shop around hot papers, seeking a journal that will
publish it fastest. Mitalipov told Nature he was in a hurry to
get his Cell paper out before a stem cell meeting in June.
