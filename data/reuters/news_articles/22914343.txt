* Homeless have higher rates of TB, HIV and Hep C* Experts should focus on homeless to fight infectionsBy LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Homeless people across the world
have dramatically higher rates of infection with tuberculosis
(TB), HIV and hepatitis C and could fuel community epidemics
that cost governments dear, a study showed on Monday.With an estimated 650,000 homeless people in the United
States and around 380,000 in Britain, experts said high levels
of infection would not only cause yet more poverty and distress
for those without homes, but could also become a wider problem."Infections in homeless people can lead to community
infections and are associated with malnutrition, long periods of
homelessness and high use of medical services," said Seena
Fazel, a senior research fellow in clinical science at the
University of Oxford who led the study.Fazel and his team analysed more than 40 research papers on
levels of HIV, hepatitis C and TB among homeless people from
1984 to 2012.They found that in the United States, for example, TB rates
were at least 46 times greater in the homeless than in the
general population, and the prevalence of hepatitis C viral
infection was more than four times higher.In Britain, TB rates were about 34 times higher in homeless
people than in the general population, and the prevalence of
hepatitis C viral infection was nearly 50 times higher.For HIV, rates of infection were typically between 1 and 20
times higher in homeless people in the United States than the
general population, but no studies were found for Britain.Fazel said his findings suggested the best way to fight back
against these and other infectious diseases was to focus on the
homeless as one of the highest risk groups."Because ... numbers of homeless people are high in some
countries, improvements in care could have pronounced effects on
public health," he said.Fazel, whose study was published in The Lancet Infectious
Diseases journal, said similar patterns were found in most other
countries where data were available. Other countries covered in
the study included France, India, Sweden, Ireland and Brazil.According to United Nations estimates, about 100 million
people worldwide are homeless. It is well known that rates of
illness and premature death are particularly high in this group.TB kills an estimated 1.4 million people annually, and about
9 million people are newly infected each year around the world.Because it is a bacterial infection that spreads through the
air in droplets when infected people cough and sneeze, it can
develop into community outbreaks.Anyone with active TB can easily infect another 10 to 15
people a year, and because successful treatment for TB requires
months of antibiotics, patient care can be expensive.In the United States, nearly 60,000 new cases of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS are reported
nationally every year.The researchers said this research focused on HIV, Hepatitis
C and TB because their initial work suggested these were the
most heavily studied infections among homeless populations.But they noted the homeless also have high rates of other
infectious diseases, including hepatitis A and B, diphtheria,
foot problems and skin infections.
