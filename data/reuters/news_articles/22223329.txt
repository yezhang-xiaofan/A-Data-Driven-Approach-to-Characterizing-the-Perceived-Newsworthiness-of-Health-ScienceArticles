 Jan 11 The incidence of leukaemia
is twice as high in children living close to French nuclear
power plants as in those living elsewhere in the country, a
study by French health and nuclear safety experts has found.But the study, to be published soon in the International
Journal of Cancer, fell short of establishing a causal link
between the higher incidence of leukaemia, a type of blood
cancer, and living near nuclear power plants.France has used nuclear power for three decades and is the
most nuclear-reliant country in the world, with 75 percent of
its electricity produced by 58 reactors.The study, conducted by the French health research body
INSERM, found that between 2002 and 2007, 14 children under the
age of 15 living in a 5-kilometre radius of France's 19 nuclear
power plants had been diagnosed with leukaemia.This is double the rate of the rest of the country, where a
total of 2,753 cases were diagnosed in the same period."This is a result which has been checked thoroughly and
which is statistically significant," said Dominique Laurier,
head of the epidemiology research laboratory at France's nuclear
safety research body (IRSN).INSERM has carried out similar research with the IRSN since
1990, but has never before found a higher incidence of leukaemia
 in children living near nuclear power plants."But we are working on numbers which are very small and
results have to be analysed with a lot of care," said Laurier,
one of the authors of the study.Laurier said the findings indicated no difference in risk
between sites located by the sea or by rivers, nor according to
the power capacity of the plant.The IRSN said it recommended a more thorough study of the
causes of the leukaemia cases found near nuclear power stations
and hoped to set up international research collaboration."It's a rare disease and working on a bigger scale would
allow more stable results," said Laurier.A 35-year British study published last year found no
evidence that young children living near nuclear power plants
had an increased risk of developing leukaemia.The research, conducted by scientists on the Committee of
the Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE),
found only 20 cases of childhood leukaemia within 5 km (3.1
miles) of nuclear power stations between 1969 and 2004.The scientists said the rate was virtually the same as in
areas where there were no nuclear plants.Studies have been conducted around the world into possible
links between the risk of childhood blood cancers and living
near nuclear plants.A study on Germany, published in 2007, did find a
significantly increased risk, but the COMARE team said these
findings were probably influenced by an unexplained leukaemia
cluster near a nuclear plant in Krummel, north Germany, that
lasted from 1990 to 2005.Excluding Krummel, evidence for an increased leukaemia risk
among young children living close to German nuclear power plants
was "extremely weak", it said.(Reporting By Muriel Boselli, Editing by Alexandria Sage and
