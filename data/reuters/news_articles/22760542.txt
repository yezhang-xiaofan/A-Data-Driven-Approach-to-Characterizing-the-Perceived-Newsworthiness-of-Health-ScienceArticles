(Repeats to fix typo in paragraph 9)* Stem cells from amniotic fluid can be reprogrammed* No new genes needed, making technique less problematic* Amniotic stem cells could be frozen, banked for future useBy LONDON, July 3 (Reuters) - Stem cells taken from amniotic
fluid can be transformed into a more versatile state similar to
embryonic stem cells and may offer an alternative to the
medically valuable but controversial cells, scientists said on
Tuesday.British researchers said they had succeeded in reprogramming
amniotic fluid cells without having to introduce extra genes.This suggests the possibility that stem cells derived from
donated amniotic fluid could be stored in banks and used for
medical therapies and in research, they said, offering a less
problematic alternative to embryonic stem cells.Stem cells are the body's master cells, the source for all
other cells. Scientists say that by helping to regenerate
tissue, they could offer new ways of treating diseases for which
there are currently no treatments - including heart disease,
Parkinson's and stroke.Embryonic stem cells are harvested from embryos and have the
potential to become almost any type of tissue. Other types of
stem cells, including adult or so-called "induced pluripotent"
stem cells, are less controversial, but are also less flexible.Alternatives to embryonic stem cells are always being keenly
sought, partly due to ethical concerns and also due to the
limited availability of donor embryos.In this study, published in the journal Molecular Therapy,
scientists from Imperial College London and University College
London's (UCL) Institute of Child Health said amniotic fluid
stem cells are an intermediate between embryonic and adult stem
cells.PLURIPOTENT"They have some potential to develop into different cell
types but they are not pluripotent," said Pascale Guillot, from
the Imperial's department of surgery and cancer.But she said their study had shown that these cells can
revert to being fully flexible, or "pluripotent", by adding a
chemical that modifies the configuration of the DNA.Guillot's team used stem cells from amniotic fluid donated
by mothers who had undergone amniocentesis tests during the
first trimester of a pregnancy.The cells were grown on a gelatinous protein mixture in the
lab and reprogrammed into a more primitive state by adding a
drug called valproic acid.The researchers then carried out a series of tests and found
the reprogrammed cells had become pluripotent - in other words
they had very similar properties to embryonic stem cells.The team also found that even after they had been growing in
culture for some time, the reprogrammed cells were able to
develop into many different types of functioning cells,
including liver, bone and nerve cells.They also maintained their pluripotency even after being
frozen and then thawed out.UCL's Paolo De Coppi, who co-led the study with Guillot,
said the study confirmed that amniotic fluid is a good source of
stem cells.Previous research has shown it is possible to make adult
cells become pluripotent by introducing extra genes into the
cells, often using viruses.But the efficiency of this type of reprogramming is
relatively low and there is a risk of problems caused by
disrupting the DNA."The advantages of generating pluripotent cells without any
genetic manipulation make them more likely to be used for
therapy," De Coppi said.Amniotic fluid surrounds and helps feed and protect the
growing baby in the womb. It can be extracted through the
mother's belly using a fine needle in a process called
amniocentesis which is sometimes used to test for genetic
diseases during early pregnancy.
