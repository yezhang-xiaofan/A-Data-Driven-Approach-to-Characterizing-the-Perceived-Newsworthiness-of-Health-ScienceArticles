 An international research team
says it has found a way to identify hotspots of malaria parasite
evolution and track the rise of resistance to malaria drugs
faster and more efficiently than before.The success of the technique, which involves analysing the
genetic maps of malaria parasites straight from patients' blood
samples, suggests scientists should be able to track changes in
the parasite population and follow the disease's evolution.Malaria infects more than 200 million people worldwide every
year and kills around 600,000 of them - primarily children under
age five in sub-Saharan Africa.Most severe forms of malaria are caused by the parasite
plasmodium falciparum, which is spread by mosquitoes.Experts say one of the most challenging features of this
parasite is its ability to evolve and overcome anti-malarial
drugs - a factor which is undermining global work towards
eradicating the killer disease."If we want to control resistance, we first need to be able
to monitor the genetic diversity of P. falciparum and identify
hotspots of potential resistance as they occur," said Dominic
Kwiatkowski, of Britain's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and
Oxford University, who led the research team."Rapid sequencing of parasite genomes from the blood of
infected people is a powerful way of detecting changes in the
parasite population and potentially an important new
surveillance tool ... for controlling malaria."Kwiatkowski's team developed a new technique to extract the
parasite's DNA directly from blood removing as much human DNA
from the sample as possible.The new method means there is no need to grow the parasite
in a blood culture in a laboratory dish before deciphering its
genetic code, speeding up the process and minimising the
potential for mistakes, the researchers explained in a report of
the study published in the journal Nature on Wednesday.The team used the technique to analyse samples from Burkina
Faso, Cambodia, Kenya, Mali, Papua New Guinea and Thailand.They found that one infected person could harbour several
genetically different malaria parasites, which allowed the
parasite populations to swap DNA and create new forms.This showed how the pace of parasite evolution is
drastically affected by human factors as well as geography, the
researchers said."The emergence and spread of anti-malarial drug resistance
is a major threat to current global initiatives to control and
eliminate malaria," said Nick White of Oxford University and
Mahidol University in Thailand, who also worked on the study.He said new insights like those revealed by this study are
essential if scientists are to be able to identify, map, and
then contain spreading resistance."We can now build on this technique to identify hotspots of
anti-malarial drug resistance around the world and contain them
effectively," he said.
