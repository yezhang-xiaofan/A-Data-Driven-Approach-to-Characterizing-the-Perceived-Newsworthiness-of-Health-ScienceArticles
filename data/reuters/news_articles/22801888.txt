 Blacks in the United States with throat
cancer are more likely than whites to have surgery that leaves
them unable to speak than to get gentler voice-preserving
therapy, according to a study.Previous research has found a similar racial disparity in
breast cancer treatment, with blacks more often having the
entire breast removed instead of just the cancerous lumps.It's unclear why the disparity exists. But study leader
Allen Chen, a radiation oncologist at University of California,
Davis, said that poverty, less education and deep-rooted
historical biases could all be at work."There could be an underlying distrust among African
Americans where they feel anything less than surgery might be
considered quote-unquote experimental," Chen told Reuters
Health.He referenced the Tuskegee experiment, conducted by the U.S.
government from the 1930s into the 1970s, in which black
patients with syphilis went untreated despite assurances to the
contrary."That sort of distrust needs to be addressed or alleviated,"
Chen said, because voice-preserving treatment for throat cancer,
based on radiation and drug therapy, is now the standard.His study, published in the Archives of Otolaryngology -
Head &amp; Neck Surgery, is based on data from a US cancer registry
including nearly 5,400 cases of laryngeal cancer between 1991
and 2008.About 80 percent of whites had voice-preserving treatment,
while the rest had their voice box surgically removed - the
traditional approach.Among blacks, 75 percent had the gentler therapy. While
that's only a five-percent difference, "I think that's a gap
that needs to be narrowed," Chen added.The racial disparity remained after researchers accounted
for age, sex and how advanced patients' tumors were, and it
didn't disappear in the more recent half of the study, either.
However, there was no significant gap between whites and
Hispanics or Asians.The study didn't look at income or education, which might
explain some of the difference. It's also possible that more
blacks lived in areas without access to the resources involved
in voice-preserving therapy, which requires cooperation between
doctors with different specialties.While the gentler therapy might be just as effective as
surgery, an operation does have the advantage of being over at
once, whereas it takes several weeks of treatment for drugs and
radiation to work.But if it's a question of people believing treatment other
than surgery is experimental, he added, "That perception needs
to be changed."
