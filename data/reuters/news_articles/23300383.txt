 Dec 28 The discovery that a protein
which triggers milk production in women may also be responsible
for making breast cancers aggressive could open up new
opportunities for treatment of the most common and deadliest
form of cancer among women.Found in all breast cells, the protein ELF5 tries to
activate milk production even in breast cancer cells, which does
not work and then makes the cancer more aggressive, according to
scientists in Australia and Britain."The discovery opens up new avenues for therapy and for
designing new markers that can predict response to therapy,"
said lead author Professor Chris Ormandy from the Garvan
Institute of Medical Research in Sydney.In 2008, Ormandy's work linked ELF5 to milk production.The latest research by Ormandy and his team, published in
the journal PLOS Biology on Friday, went a step further to find
the link between ELF5 and breast cancer."Cancer cells can't respond properly (to ELF5), so they ...
acquire some characteristics ... that make the disease more
aggressive and more refractory (resistant) to treatment with
existing therapies," Ormandy said by telephone.Ormandy and his team grew human breast cancer tissues,
genetically manipulated to contain high amounts of ELF5, in
petri dishes and saw how the protein proliferated aggressively.FINDINGS MAY HELP TARGETED THERAPYBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the
top cause of cancer death among women, accounting for 23 percent
of total cancer cases and 14 percent of cancer deaths in women.To decide on treatment, doctors normally need to find out if
the cancer has receptors for the hormones estrogen and
progesterone, which, in the case of breast cancer patients,
promote growth in their tumours.Two-thirds of breast cancers are usually positive for
estrogen receptors, which then require anti-hormonal therapies
that lower estrogen levels in the patient or block estrogen from
supporting the growth of the cancer.For the remaining one-third of patients, their cancers do
not have receptors, which means they won't benefit from hormonal
therapies. Such patients are usually given other treatments,
such as chemotherapy.Ormandy's team found that cancers with these receptors had
low levels of ELF5, while those without receptors had
significantly higher levels of the protein."What we have shown in this paper is high ELF5 tumours are
dependent on ELF5 for their proliferation and if we block ELF5
in high ELF5 tumours, we will block proliferation and that will
treat the tumour," Ormandy said."If we can develop a drug that targets ELF5, it will be very
useful for that group of women," he said.
