* Overall efficacy 30.2 pct, statistically insignificant* Vaccine fails to stop dengue type 2 in Thai study* Does show efficacy against dengue types 1, 3 and 4* Sanofi's dengue vaccine most advanced in developmentBy LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - The world's most advanced
vaccine against dengue fever, being developed by French
drugmaker Sanofi SA, proved only 30 percent effective
in a large clinical trial in Thailand - far less than hoped.The result leaves uncertain the future of a product that
Sanofi has previously said could generate more than 1 billion
euros ($1.3 billion) in yearly sales. But researchers said it
did show for the first time that a safe vaccine was possible.The disappointing outcome was down to the vaccine's failure 
to protect against one type of dengue virus, which turned out to
be the prevalent one in Thailand at the time of the study.Overall efficacy was 30.2 percent - statistically
insignificant and well below the 70 percent-plus researchers had
anticipated at the start of the company-funded trial.The mosquito-borne disease, also known as "breakbone fever",
is a threat to nearly 3 billion people and is caused by four
types of virus, none of which confers immunity from the others."This result knocked me off my chair," Scott Halstead, a
senior scientific adviser for the non-profit Dengue Vaccine
Initiative, who was not involved in the study, told Reuters."This is a very sobering outcome and a lot of thought and
further experimentation is going to have to be done in order to
understand what happened."You can't be very confident that this vaccine is going to
significantly reduce human illness."Hopes had been high for the closely watched Thai trial,
given the fact that dengue belongs to the same virus class as
yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis, both of which are
controlled with highly effective existing vaccines.But it seems that making a mixed dengue vaccine containing
four different virus strains can produce uneven results,
underscoring the complexity of a disease that scientists have
been trying to develop a vaccine against for over 70 years.Despite the findings, industry analysts said Sanofi's
ChimeriVax vaccine remained well ahead of rivals in development
and should continue to enjoy a first-mover advantage."Even if not perfect, ChimeriVax will be used, but it will
not be the vaccine that will eradicate dengue," said Eric Le
Berrigaud, an analyst at stockbroker Bryan Garnier.Shares in Sanofi outperformed a stronger European drugs
sector, adding 1.6 percent by 1040 GMT on Tuesday, buoyed
separately by hopes for its new multiple sclerosis pill Aubagio,
for which a U.S. approval decision is expected by Wednesday.WAITING FOR PHASE IIISanofi had already disclosed in July that the Thai dengue
study showed efficacy against three of the four strains, without
giving details. The full findings were published online on
Monday night in the The Lancet medical journal.Despite the disappointment, Jean Lang, Sanofi's head of
dengue vaccine development, said the Phase IIb study involving
4,002 Thai children was encouraging, given the protection
provided against three of the virus strains.Efficacy was around 60 percent against dengue virus type 1
and 80-90 percent against types 3 and 4. Interestingly, a single
dose of the vaccine proved roughly as good as three doses."This is a milestone, but we need to wait for the results of
two large Phase III efficacy trials to have a better
understanding of the vaccine," Lang said.Sanofi is conducting final-stage Phase III trials with
31,000 participants in Asia and Latin America.If the Thai trial results had been strong enough, it could
have filed for early marketing approval in some countries.
Instead, attention will now focus on results for the ongoing
Phase III trials, with any commercial launch in 2015 or later.Other drug companies are also working on dengue vaccines but
Sanofi's product is several years ahead. In a bid to stay in the
lead, the French group has already invested 350 million euros in
a new French factory to make its vaccine.MATHEMATICAL MODELSHalstead, who wrote an accompanying commentary on the study
in The Lancet, said it was possible that a vaccine against three
out or four virus strains might still combat dengue effectively,
since severe disease is caused by a second infection.He suggested mathematical models could be used as a first
step to work out the impact.Dengue fever, which can cause intense joint and muscle pain,
is spread by the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The insect
thrives in the mega-cities of the tropics.In the past 50 years there has been a 30-fold jump in dengue
cases. The World Health Organisation officially puts infections
at 50-100 million a year, though many experts think this
assessment from the 1990s badly underestimates the disease.Most patients survive dengue, but it is estimated to kill
about 20,000 every year, many of them children, who are less
able to fight it off.
