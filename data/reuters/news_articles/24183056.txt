* New H7N9 bird flu has killed 45 people, infected 137* Shutting down bird markets estimated to cost 57 bln yuan* Study finds closures cut daily infections by 97 percent* Results may arm policymakers before feared bird flu surgeBy LONDON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - China should close live poultry
markets in big cities to disrupt the spread of a new strain of
bird flu that resurfaced there earlier this month, scientists
said, after a previous shutdown was found to have slashed the
number of human cases.In a study published in The Lancet medical journal on
Thursday, researchers from Hong Kong and China said that while
closing markets during the height of the first outbreak of H7N9
in April may have been costly, it reduced human infections
dramatically and should be done again if cases rise as feared.The findings - of a more than 97 percent reduction in the
daily number of human cases of the new H7N9 strain after the
markets were closed compared with before - should give
policymakers confidence that the economic costs of shutting
markets is balanced by significant health gains."(This) is a highly effective intervention to prevent human
disease and protect public health," said Benjamin Cowling of
Hong Kong University, who led the study and had it published in
the Lancet medical journal.Based on his findings, he said the best approach to minimise
the spread of the H7N9 bird flu virus ahead of an expected surge
in cases during the winter flu season would be to shut down
markets wherever the virus is detected.Two new human cases of H7N9 bird flu were found in China's
eastern Zhejiang province in October, the first in what some flu
experts fear may be a fresh epidemic of the deadly disease to
come during China's colder winter months."This is of great concern because it reveals that the H7N9
virus has continued to circulate and now has the potential to
re-emerge in a new outbreak of human disease this winter," said
Cowling, echoing similar fears expressed by Chinese researchers
in a study published last week.DEATH RATE 30 PERCENTSome 45 people have so far been killed by H7N9 flu strain,
many of them during a flare-up in March and April just after the
virus first emerged in humans earlier in February.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says it has now recorded
137 laboratory confirmed cases, suggesting a death rate for the
new strain of more than 30 percent.At the start of April, several weeks after the first human
cases of H7N9 bird flu emerged, 780 live poultry markets in the
Chinese cities of Shanghai, Hangzhou, Huzhou and Nanjing were
closed to try and halt virus spread.The closures have been estimated to have cost more than 57
billion yuan ($9.35 billion), so Cowling's team set out to study
whether those costs could be justified.The team analysed data on every laboratory confirmed case of
H7N9 in those four cities up to June 1, 2013 and entered them
into a statistical calculation method called a Bayesian model
which was able to quantify the before-and-after effects of
shutting down the markets.The results found the closures cut the average daily number
of H7N9 human infections by 99 percent in Shanghai, 99 percent
in Hangzhou, 97 percent in Huzhou and 97 percent in Nanjing."Without this robust evidence, policymakers would struggle
to justify further closures of LPMs because of the millennia-old
culture of trading live birds and the potential huge economic
loss on the poultry industry in China," said Cowling.Yet with it, he added, the best course of action to minimise
the spread of the virus ahead of the expected surge in
infections in the winter would be sustained live poultry market 
closure in areas of high risk of disease spread, and immediate
market closure in areas where the virus appears in future.
