* Danish man gets sense of touch with artificial hand* Prototype still several years from widespread use* Researchers refining device, plan longer-term trialsBy LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Dennis Aabo Sorensen lost his left
hand when a firework rocket he was holding exploded during New
Year's Eve celebrations 10 years ago, and he never expected to
feel anything with the stump again.But for a while last year he regained his sense of touch
after being attached to a "feeling" bionic hand that allowed him
to grasp and identify objects even when blindfolded.The prototype device, which was wired to nerves in the
36-year-old Dane's left arm, blurs the boundary between body and
machine and scientists hope it could one day revolutionise the
lives of many amputees.There is still work to be done in miniaturising components
and tidying away trailing cables that mean the robotic hand has
so far only been used in the lab, but Sorensen said the European
research team behind the project had got the basics right."It was a great experience. It's amazing to feel something
you haven't been able to feel for so many years," he told
Reuters in a telephone interview. "It was pretty close to having
the same feeling as in my normal hand."Details of his month-long use of the bionic hand, including
results from a week of concentrated daily tests, were reported
by researchers from Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Britain and
Denmark in the journal Science Translational Medicine on
Wednesday.Alastair Ritchie, a bioengineering expert at the University
of Nottingham, who was not involved in the research, said the
device was a logical next step but more clinical trials were now
needed to confirm the system's viability."It's very exciting preliminary data but it's a one-case
study and we now need to see more cases," he said.Despite notable advances with prosthetic limbs, current
artificial hands fall down when it comes to providing sensory
feedback - a key element in human dexterity.In his every day life Sorensen uses a commercial prosthetic
hand that can detect muscle movement in his stump to open and
close his hand, but provides no sense of touch and requires him
to watch constantly to prevent objects being crushed.The new so-called LifeHand 2 prosthesis is far more
sophisticated in combining intra-nerve wiring, robotics and
computer science to create life-like feeling.IMPLANTED ELECTRODESUltra-thin electrodes the width of a human hair were
surgically implanted into the ulnar and median nerves of
Sorensen's arm before he was attached to the robotic hand, which
is equipped with various artificial sensors.These sensors measure the tension in man-made tendons on
each finger to assess the force used to grasp different objects,
while computer algorithms transform this information into an
electrical signal that the nerves can interpret.The result is real-time sensation, including a gradation in
feelings that allowed Sorensen in tests to detect both shape and
consistency. In a series of experiments, he was able to
recognise the basic shapes of objects, such as the cylinder of a
bottle, and also feel differences in the stiffness between a
mandarin orange and a baseball.It is a big advance on an initial LifeHand 1 device unveiled
in 2009, which was less refined and was not implanted on the
patient but only connected through electrodes.There is still a need for further work, however, in order
for the new hand to differentiate between more detailed
textures, as well as between hot and cold.Silvestro Micera, an engineer at the Ecole Polytechnique
Federale de Lausanne and the Cuola Superiore Sant'Anna in Pisa,
said the challenge now was to ensure the system could remain
implanted on multiple patients for "many months"."Our final goal is to have this in clinical practice in
five, six or seven years time - but the next step is to show in
two to three years that this can work long term not just in one
patient but in several patients," he said.Assuming further clinical trials go well, the research team
is likely eventually to bring in a commercial partner, although
Micera said this was not on the cards just yet.One big unknown is cost. The high-tech device will not be
cheap but Micera said the surgery to implant the electrodes was
relatively straightforward, which should limit hospital bills.
