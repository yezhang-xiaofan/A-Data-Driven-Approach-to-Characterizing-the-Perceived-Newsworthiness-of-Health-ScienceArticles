 May 14 When London marathon medical
director Sanjay Sharma was called to attend someone who had
collapsed with suspected cardiac arrest a mile from the finish
line last month, he expected to find a man in his seventies."I had to hide my horror as I saw a young, athletic woman,"
he says. "I had to... compose myself for a few seconds before we
started resuscitation."Lying on the ground was 30-year-old Claire Squires, whose
sudden death, along with those of Italian footballer Piermario
Morosini and Norwegian Olympic swimmer Alexander Dale Oen, has
drawn fresh attention to shocking heart problems that bring down
young, fit people at the top of their game.The case of English Premier League footballer Fabrice
Muamba, who collapsed on the pitch in front of a stadium packed
with spectators last month, has similarly focused minds.Sharma, who was speaking at a sports science conference in
London ahead of the 2012 Olympic Games when an estimated 10,000
athletes will be pushing themselves to the limit in the British
capital, urged health professionals to be vigilant."Something should be done, if we are... encouraging athletes
to push themselves like that," he said. "We protect their
musculoskeletal system, we protect their brains, we protect
their nutritional status, so why can't we protect their hearts?"In sudden cardiac death (SCD), the heart abruptly and
unexpectedly stops working. Experts describe it as an
"electrical problem", often caused by a heart rhythm disorder
called ventricular fibrillation.In sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), which was what brought
Bolton Wanderers midfielder Muamba to the ground, the heart is
no longer able to pump blood to the rest of the body.Fortunately, Muamba recovered but, says University College
London sports scientist Richard Weiler, cases like his are
likely to continue to crop up despite some screening programmes
and the main problem is they are still poorly understood."Each young athletic life lost to SCD or blighted by a
sudden cardiac arrest is a powerful reminder that despite our
growing knowledge, we still lack many answers to basic questions
about these afflictions," Weiler and a team of other sports
science experts wrote in the British Journal of Sports Medicine
(BJSM) on Saturday.BETTER DATAOne of the most obvious knowledge gaps is in the numbers.
Experts say SCD is rare, affecting just a handful of people out
of every 100,000, but it also appears to be more common in
athletes than in the general population.Yet these data come with their own health warning - most of
them are collected from media reports of high profile sporting
deaths. There are no proper registries to collect numbers either
within a specific sport or country, or cross-border and
cross-discipline.For the best clues, experts point to one of the largest
studies on SCD conducted in the United States between 2004 and
2008 in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).It found that SCD is over three times more common in
African-Americans than Caucasians, but this varied greatly
across sports.In American Football, SCD rates are four times higher in
Caucasians than African-Americans, and in soccer there were no
cardiac events recorded during the five-year period.Having searched this and other scientific literature on
sudden deaths in sport, experts writing in the BJSM - including
sports scientists from the English Football Association, the
London-based Royal Ballet and world soccer governing body FIFA's
Medical Assessment and Research Center in Switzerland - say
there are far too many questions unanswered."There's so much we don't know," Weiler said in a telephone
interview. "We don't know what triggers sudden cardiac death. We
don't understand the risks in different sports, we don't
understand whether race and genetics have an impact, and we
don't know why many cases of sudden cardiac death remain
unexplained."WIDESPREAD SCREENING?Though these deaths are sudden and unexpected, Sharma, who
is also a consultant cardiologist at St George's Hospital in
London, says most heart specialists have tools to diagnose the
conditions that cause them, pinpointing those most at risk.They are usually caused by hereditary electrical or
structural faults of the heart that show up in heart scans or in
family history, he says.This leads some sports scientists to say more widespread
screening may be the answer.FIFA recommends cardiac screening and sets it as a
requirement for players in teams taking part in its tournaments,
but there are no set rules across sports or borders.Sharma cites data from the Veneto region of Italy, which
suggest a programme that screens athletes every year and bans
people with worrying conditions from taking part in competitive
sport has cut the number of sudden cardiac deaths in athletes by
90 percent - from 3.6 per 100,000 person-years in 1979/1980 to
0.4 per 100,000 person-years in 2003/2004.But the Italian programme disqualified 2 percent of all
athletes, leading critics to say that for every one death
prevented, around 1,000 athletes are needlessly banned from
competing in a sport they love.Screening is also expensive, raising the question of whether
it is cost-effective for such a rare problem."You tend to get lots of false positives, and that means you
can create unnecessary anxiety and worry about the results,"
Weiler said. "And there are also people who slip through the
net. We don't really understand what we're looking for yet."
