 Four young women born with
abnormal or missing vaginas were implanted with lab-grown
versions made from their own cells, the latest success in
creating replacement organs that have so far included tracheas,
bladders and urethras.Follow-up tests show the new vaginas are indistinguishable
from the women's own tissue and have grown in size as the young
women, who got the implants as teens, matured.All four of the women are now sexually active and report
normal vaginal function. Two of the four, who were born with a
working uterus but no vagina, now menstruate normally.It is not yet clear whether these women can bear children,
but because they are menstruating, it suggests their ovaries are
working, so it may be possible, said Dr Anthony Atala, director
of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center's Institute for
Regenerative Medicine in North Carolina.The feat, which Atala and colleagues in Mexico describe in
the journal the Lancet, is the latest demonstration from the
growing field of regenerative medicine, a discipline in which
doctors take advantage of the body's power to regrow and replace
cells.In prior studies, Atala's team has used the approach to make
replacement bladders and urine tubes or urethras in young boys.Atala said the pilot study is the first to show that vaginal
organs custom-built in the lab using patients' own cells can be
successfully used in humans, offering a new option for women who
need reconstructive surgeries.All four of the women in the study were born with
Mayer-Rokitansky-Kster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a rare genetic
condition in which the vagina and uterus are underdeveloped or
absent. Conventional treatment generally involves the use of
grafts made from intestinal tissue or from skin, but both
tissues have drawbacks, says Atala, a pediatric urologic surgeon
at Wake Forest.Intestinal tissue produces an excess of mucus, which can
cause problems with odor. Conventional skin, meanwhile, can
collapse.Atala said women with this condition usually seek treatment
as teenagers. "They can't menstruate, especially when they have
a severe defect where they don't have an opening," he said. This
can cause abdominal pain as menstrual blood collects in the
abdomen. "It has nowhere else to go," he added.Girls in the study were aged 13 and 18 at the time of the
surgeries, which were performed between June 2005 and October
2008.The researchers started off by collecting a small amount of
cells from genital tissue and grew two types of cells in the
lab: muscle cells and epithelial cells, a type of cell that
lines body cavities. About four weeks later, the team started
applying layers of the cells onto a scaffold made of collagen, a
material that can be absorbed by the body. They then shaped the
organ to fit each patient's anatomy, and placed it in an
incubator.A week later, the team created a cavity in the body and
surgically attached the vaginal implants to existing
reproductive organs. Once implanted, nerves and blood vessels
formed to feed the new organ, and new cells eventually replaced
the scaffolding as it was absorbed by the body."By the six-month time point, you couldn't tell the
difference between engineered organ and the normal organ," Atala
said.The team continued to monitor the young women, taking tissue
biopsies, MRI scans and internal exams, for up to eight years
from the initial implants.All of these tests showed the engineered vaginas "were
similar in makeup and function to native tissue," said
Atlantida-Raya Rivera, director of the HIMFG Tissue Engineering
Laboratory at the Metropolitan Autonomous University in Mexico
City, where the surgeries were performed.Professor Martin Birchall of UCL Ear Institute in London,
who wrote a commentary in the same journal, said the findings
address some important questions about tissue-engineering,
including whether tissue will grow as patients grow and whether
an organ as large as the vagina can develop blood vessels when
implanted in the body.
