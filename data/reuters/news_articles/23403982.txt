 Feb 13 Thermo Fisher Scientific 
said it had total confidence in its antibiotic test kits, after
an investigation published in a medical journal alleged they did
not always contain the right amount of antibiotic.The British Medical Journal (BMJ) said in a report published
on Wednesday that Thermo Fisher's British-based Oxoid unit had
been selling flawed antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST)
discs.AST discs, which contain specified amounts of antibiotics,
are used in hospitals worldwide to see if a particular infection
will respond to a particular drug. After being swabbed with a
sample, a clear zone forms in areas where the drugs are working.The BMJ said internal documents provided by a whistleblower
showed that batches of the discs had been released which did not
contain the correct amount of drug and sometimes no drug at all.The company said it completely disagreed with the BMJ
article, adding that an independent investigator had studied
similar concerns raised by an employee at the time he left the
company in 2008 and had found them to be without merit.U.S.-based Thermo Fisher is the world's largest maker of
laboratory equipment.
