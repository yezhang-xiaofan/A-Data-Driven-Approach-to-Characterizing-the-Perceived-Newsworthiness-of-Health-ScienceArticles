 Scientists have created an
"intelligent" surgical knife that can detect in seconds whether
tissue being cut is cancerous, promising more effective and
accurate surgery in future.The device, built by researchers at London's Imperial
College, could allow doctors to cut back on additional
operations to remove further pieces of cancerous tumours.The technology, effectively merging an electrosurgical knife
that cuts through tissue using heat with a mass spectrometer for
chemical analysis, has also been shown to be able to distinguish
beef from horsemeat.Surgeons often find it impossible to tell by sight where
tumours end and healthy tissue begins, so some cancer cells are
often left behind. A fifth of breast cancer patients who have
lumpectomy surgery need a second operation.The new "iKnife" is designed to get round the problem by
instantly sampling the smoke given off as tissue is cut through
using an electric current to see if it is cancerous.In the first study to test the device in patients, the
iKnife diagnosed tissue samples from 91 patients with 100
percent accuracy, researchers at Imperial College London
reported in Science Translational Medicine on Wednesday.Currently, removed tissue can be sent for laboratory
analysis while the patient remains under general anaesthetic -
but each test takes around half an hour, while the iKnife
provides feedback in less than three seconds.It does this by analysing biological information given off
from burning tissue and comparing the findings to a database of
biological fingerprints from tumours and healthy tissue."It's a really exciting innovation and a very promising
technique for all types of surgery," said Emma King, a head and
neck surgeon at Southampton Hospital, England, who was not
involved in the research.Still, she now wants to see how the iKnife performs in a
randomised clinical trial.CLINICAL TRIALZoltan Takats of Imperial College, who invented the device,
said he aimed to test it in such a study, involving between
1,000 and 1,500 patients with various types of cancers.That trial process is likely to take two or three years and
only then will the iKnife be submitted for regulatory approval,
paving the way for its commercialisation.Takats has founded a Budapest-based company called MediMass
to develop the product and he expects to strike a partnership
deal with a major medical technology company to bring it to
market in North America and Europe.Hi-tech surgical equipment is being used increasingly in
modern hospitals to help surgeons do a better job, most notably
with the da Vinci surgical robot from Intuitive Surgical
.The current experimental version of the iKnife cost Takats
and colleagues at Imperial around 200,000 pounds ($300,000) to
build. Takats said the price would come down once it entered
commercial production.The research was welcomed by health minister Lord Howe, who
said it could benefit both patients and the health service by
reducing the number of people needing secondary operations for
cancer.The iKnife may also have a place beyond cancer, according to
Takats, since it can identify tissue with an inadequate blood
supply, as well as types of bacteria present in tissue.
