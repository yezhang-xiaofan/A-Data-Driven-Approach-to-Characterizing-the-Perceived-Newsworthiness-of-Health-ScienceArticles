 Feb 7 Increasing the minimum price of
alcohol by 10 percent can lead to immediate and significant
drops in drink-related deaths and may also have long-term
beneficial health effects, according to a study published on
Thursday.Canadian researchers found that deaths caused by alcohol
between 2002 and 2009 in the western province of British
Columbia dropped when the minimum alcohol price was increased,
while alcohol-related deaths rose when more private alcohol
stores were opened.The findings will be keenly scrutinised by alcohol policy
makers, particularly in Britain where the government plans to
introduce a minimum price on alcohol to try to clamp down on
binge drinking and anti-social behaviour. The United States does
not currently set a minimum alcohol price."This study adds to the scientific evidence that, despite
popular opinion to the contrary, even the heaviest drinkers
reduce their consumption when minimum alcohol prices increase,"
said Tim Stockwell of the University of Victoria's Centre for
Addictions Research of British Columbia, who led the study.John Holmes of the alcohol research group at Britain's
University of Sheffield said Stockwell's study was a major
contribution to evidence about minimum alcohol pricing and gave
a "strong indication that the policy has reduced the consumption
levels of those drinking at hazardous and harmful levels."Stockwell's team, whose research was published in the
journal Addiction, looked at three categories of death linked to
alcohol - wholly alcohol attributable, acute, and chronic -
analysing death rates across the time period against increases
in government-set minimum prices of alcohol drinks.The study was complicated by another policy in British
Columbia under which alcohol sales were partially privatised
after having previous been controlled through government-owned
stores. This led to a substantial rise in the availability of
alcohol.Stockwell said the major finding was that increased minimum
alcohol prices were associated with immediate, substantial and
significant reductions in wholly alcohol attributable deaths,
with a 10 price rise followed by a 32 percent death rate drop.Significant falls in chronic and total alcohol associated
deaths were also detected between two and three years after
minimum price increases.At the same time, a 10 percent increase in the number of 
private liquor stores was associated with a two percent rise in
acute, chronic, and total alcohol associated death rates.Stockwell said the reason for the lower death rates were
likely to be due to the fact that raising the price of cheaper
drinks makes heavy drinkers drink less.Earlier research conducted by the same team and published in
January last year found that each 10 percent increase in the
minimum price of alcohol led people to drink 3.4 percent less
alcohol overall.
