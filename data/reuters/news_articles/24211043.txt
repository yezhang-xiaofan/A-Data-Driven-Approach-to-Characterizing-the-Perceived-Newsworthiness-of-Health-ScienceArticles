* Crippling viral disease re-emerged in Syria last month* WHO warns as long as any child has polio, all at risk* Inactivated vaccines used in Europe may not protect enoughBy LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Vaccinating only Syrian refugees
against polio may not be enough to prevent the crippling viral
disease from re-infecting Europe where it has not been seen for
decades, German scientists warned on Friday.Writing in The Lancet medical journal, they said the risk to
Europe from a re-emergence of polio in Syria was partly due to
the type of vaccine generally used in regions that have not had
the disease for many years.Polio, caused by a virus transmitted via contaminated food
or water, was confirmed among young children in northeast Syria
last month - its first appearance there in 14 years.The World Health Organisation (WHO) said the virus probably
spread from Pakistan - one of three countries where polio is
still endemic - and warned that Syria's outbreak posed a threat
to millions of children across the Middle EastPolio passes easily from person to person and can spread
rapidly among children, especially in the kind of unsanitary
conditions endured by displaced people in Syria or in crowded
refugee camps in neighbouring countries.The disease invades the nervous system and can cause
irreversible paralysis within hours - and the WHO's repeated
warning is that as long as any single child remains infected
with polio, children everywhere are at risk.In their Lancet paper, Martin Eichner of the University of
Tbingen and Stefan Brockmann of Germany's Reutlingen Regional
Public Health Office noted that most European countries
currently use inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) rather than oral
polio vaccination (OPV) - a live form of immunisation.And while IPV is highly effective in preventing polio
disease, it gives only partial protection from infection and is
therefore less reliable if the virus is actively circulating.Since large numbers of refugees are fleeing Syria and
seeking refuge in neighbouring countries and Europe, there is
now a chance the virus could be reintroduced into areas which
have been polio-free for decades, they said."Vaccinating only Syrian refugees - as has been recommended
by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control - must
be judged as insufficient," they wrote. "More comprehensive
measures should be taken into consideration."Among extra measures, they suggested routine screening of
sewage in areas where large numbers of Syrian refugees are
settling, to check for the possible presence of polio virus.Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Britain's University of
Reading, agreed that the fresh outbreak in Syria posed a wide
risk both to neighbouring countries and beyond."Each new baby who is born is at risk of polio until
vaccinated," he said. "Until the virus is completely extinct, it
is essential that we continue to vaccinate our children."
