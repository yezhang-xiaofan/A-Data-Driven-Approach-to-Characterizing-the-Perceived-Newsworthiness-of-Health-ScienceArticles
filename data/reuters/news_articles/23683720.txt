* Distraught parents often refuse autopsy when a baby dies* Less invasive post-mortems using scans can be as effective* Increasing baby autopsy rates will also improve researchBy LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - Bereaved parents who do not want
to see their dead babies go through a conventional autopsy could
in future be offered a less invasive option which uses magnetic
resonance imaging and blood tests to establish the cause of
death.Scientists who investigated using a combination of full body
scans and sample tests found this so-called minimally invasive
autopsy (MIA) was as effective in determining the cause of death
as a conventional procedure, which involves an open dissection
of the baby's body to examine the organs.Since the vast majority of parents whose babies die during
or soon after birth currently refuse any autopsy, the
researchers suggested the MIA could both improve rates of uptake
and reduce parents' distress while offering clear answers."Autopsies not only help us to establish the cause of death,
but they often play an important role in advancing medical
research and knowledge," said Andrew Taylor, a consultant
radiologist at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital and
University College Hospital who co-led the study."If we can find ways to continue to carry them out using
less invasive methods, such as post-mortem MRI, we can boost our
understanding of the many ways in which the body can go wrong."In a study published in the journal the Lancet, Taylor and
colleague Sudhin Thayyil, a consultant neonatologist, compared
the accuracy of a standard autopsy with that of whole-body,
post-mortem MRI with or without other minimally invasive tests.These included blood samples taken by needle, visual
examination of the body and genetic and metabolic tests.The study involved 400 cases foetuses, babies and children
under 16 years old.For foetuses and babies younger than a year, the MIA
identified the same cause of death as the full autopsy for 92
percent of the cases studied, while in children aged one to 16,
the MIA techniques were less accurate, with 54 percent of the
two types of autopsies agreeing on cause of death.The researchers said the difference in accuracy was probably
because MRI was good at picking up abnormalities in organ
structure or function, which are more likely to be causes of
death in young babies, but unable to detect infections, which
are more likely to be a cause of death in older children.Experts say that currently in Britain, some 80 percent
parents whose baby dies shortly after birth refuse consent for a
post mortem. This is despite evidence that autopsies find new
and useful information in the majority of cases.In the United States, Thayyil said, rates of autopsy in
babies are even lower."In a state of shock and grief, parents are asked if they
will consent, and while they desperately want answers about why
their baby died, many simply cannot contemplate what a post
mortem entails," said Charlotte Bevan of Sands, a charity that
campaigns for more research into stillbirth and neonatal death."Giving parents the option to have a less invasive but
equally informative investigation will not only make the
decision easier ... but could lead to an increase in post mortem
up-take and vastly improved research into why so many babies are
stillborn or die shortly after birth."
