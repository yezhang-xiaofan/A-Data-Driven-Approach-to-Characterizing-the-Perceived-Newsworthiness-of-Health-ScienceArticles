 Jan 16 Toby Stroh was in his 20s when
his doctor told him he would go blind in his 50s, and his years
of playing tennis and being able to drive or work could be gone
long before that.Now aged 56, two years after his retina was deliberately
infected with a virus carrying a gene to correct a protein
deficiency that was destroying its cells, he is a regular on the
tennis court and has a successful career in law."For the last 30 years I've been living under the insidious
inevitability of going blind," Stroh told reporters at a
briefing about his experimental treatment. "Now there is a very
real prospect I will continue to be able to see."Stroh is one of a handful of patients with an inherited
cause of progressive blindness called choroideremia who took
part in an early stage trial of a potential gene therapy
treatment designed to correct a genetic defect that means retina
cells gradually die.Although the results are from only six patients in a very
early stage Phase I trial, researchers said they suggest more
studies should be done to see if similar gene therapies could be
developed for other more common genetic causes of blindness such
as macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa.Choroideremia is caused by a mutation in a gene that makes a
protein called REP1. It affects an estimated 1 in 50,000 people
and causes sufferers - mainly men - to lose their sight
gradually as the cells in the retina degenerate.DELIVERING DNAThere is currently no licensed treatment for the condition
and eventually the photoreceptor cells - the rods and cones in
the retina that respond to light by sending signals to the brain
- die completely, leading to blindness by middle age.In the trial, a team led by Robert MacLaren of the
University of Oxford, a consultant surgeon at the Oxford Eye
Hospital, injected the patients' retinas with a vector - in this
case a genetically engineered virus - to deliver a corrective
copy of the gene to the appropriate part of the eye."The virus has to be delivered to the target cells, which
are the cells of the retina," MacLaren explained. To do that,
the surgeon performs an operation similar to cataract surgery in
which the patient's retina is detached and lifted, and the virus
is then injected underneath with a fine needle."The virus goes in, infects the cells and puts the protein
back into the cells - so we're harnessing the capability of the
virus to infect cells and deliver its DNA," he said."This is the exciting thing about gene therapy," said
MacLaren, whose trial results were published in The Lancet
medical journal on Thursday. "We're talking about a single
one-off genetic correction ... that has long-standing effects
that so far have not been shown to diminish."The results showed that of the six patients treated - each
of them only in one eye so the other could act as a comparison -
the two with the least good sight before the gene therapy had
significantly improved vision six months later.In the other four patients, whose vision was only slightly
impaired before treatment as they were at earlier stages of the
condition, the results confirmed the gene therapy is safe, with
the virus delivering its DNA without damaging the retina."It is still too early to know if the ... treatment will
last indefinitely," MacLaren said. "But we can say that the
vision improvements have been maintained for as long as we have
been following up the patients, which is two years in one case."He stressed that the therapy is still in the experimental
stage, with more trials likely to take up to five years before
it could be submitted for a licence with a view to making it
available to all patients."If we were able to treat people early, get them in their
teens or late childhood, we'd be getting the virus in before
their vision is lost," he said. "If the treatment works, we
would be able to prevent them from going blind."
