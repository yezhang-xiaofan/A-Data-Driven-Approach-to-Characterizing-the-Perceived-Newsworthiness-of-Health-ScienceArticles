* Can cause developemental difficulties - analysis* Authors see issue as medical, not ethical* Corporal punishment banned in 32 countriesBy TORONTO, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Spanking children can cause
long-term developmental damage and may even lower a child's IQ,
according to a new Canadian analysis that seeks to shift the
ethical debate over corporal punishment into the medical sphere.The study, published this week in the Canadian Medical
Association Journal, reached its conclusion after examining 20
years of published research on the issue. The authors say the
medical finding have been largely overlooked and overshadowed by
concerns that parents should have the right to determine how
their children are disciplined.While spanking is certainly not as widespread as it was 20
years ago, many still cling to the practice and see prohibiting
spanking as limiting the rights of parents.That point of view highlights the difficulty in changing
hearts and minds on the issue, despite a mountain of accumulated
evidence showing the damage physical punishment can have on a
child, says Joan Durant, a professor at University of Manitoba
and one of the authors of the study."We're really past the point of calling this a controversy.
That's a word that's used and I don't know why, because in the
research there really is no controversy," she said in an
interview."If we had this level of consistency in findings in any
other area of health, we would be acting on it. We'd be pulling
out all the stops to work on the issue."Durant and co-author Ron Ensom, with the Children's Hospital
of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, cite research showing that
physical punishment makes children more aggressive and
antisocial, and can cause cognitive impairment and
developemental difficulties.Recent studies suggest it may reduce the brain's grey matter
in areas relevant to intelligence testing."What people have realized is that physical punishment
doesn't only predict aggression consistently, it also predicts
internalizing kinds of difficulties, like depression and
substance use," said Durant."There are no studies that show any long term positive
outcomes from physical punishment."While banned in 32 countries, corporal punishment of
children retains at least partial social acceptance in much of
the world. Debates on the issue typically revolve around the
ethics of using violence to enforce discipline.With the study, Durant hopes parents will start to look at
the issue from a medical perspective."What we're hoping is that physicians will take that message
and do more to counsel parents around this and to help them
understand that physical punishment isn't getting them where
they want to go," she said.She also hopes that countries that allow the practice -
including Canada - will take another look at their child
protection laws.Canada is one of more than 190 countries to have ratified
the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, a 1989
treaty that sets out protections for children.The treaty - which has been ratified by all UN member states
except for the United States, Somalia and South Sudan - includes
a passage stating that countries must protect children from "all
forms of physical or mental violence"."If we had two or three studies that showed that if you
took 500 mg of vitamin C a day you could reduce cancer risk, we
would all be taking 500 mg of vitamin C a day," Durant said."Here, we have more than 80 studies, I would say more than
100, that show the same thing (about corporal punishment), and
yet we keep calling it controversial."(Reporting By Cameron French; editing by Rob Wilson)
