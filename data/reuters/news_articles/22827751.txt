n"&gt;Aug 13 Pregnant women who fasted during the
Islamic holy month of Ramadan were no more likely to give birth
prematurely than women who didn't observe the fast, but the
babies of women who fasted were smaller on average, a Lebanese
study has found.The researchers, whose findings appeared in BJOG: An
International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, found no
significant differences in the rate of births before the 37th
week of pregnancy among 201 pregnant Beirut women who fasted
during the daytime, compared with 201 women who didn't."Although results are reassuring as far as there is no
increased risk of pre-term delivery, the fact that the mean
birth weight was significantly lower in Ramadan-fasted women is
alarming," said study leader Anwar Nassar, a professor of
obstetrics and gynecology at the American University of Beirut
Medical Center.During Ramadan, the ninth lunar month of the Islamic
calendar, Muslims abstain from eating and drinking during the
day. While fasting is compulsory, pregnancy may be "a relative
exemption if reasons for maternal/fetal hardship are suspected."Nevertheless, many pregnant women ask whether it's all right
to fast during Ramadan, Nassar told Reuters Health.Other studies have looked at fasting during pregnancy, such
as in cases of famine or in experiments with calorie
restriction, but this is the first in the English literature to
look at the effects of Ramadan fasting on pre-term delivery.For the study, Nassar and his colleagues recruited pregnant
women from four medical centers around Beirut in August 2008,
matching the characteristics of those who planned on fasting
with a comparison group who did not fast.All the women were in their third trimester during the study
period. In 2008, Ramadan took place during September.Overall, 21 women in each group gave birth before their 37th
week of pregnancy, which is considered "pre-term."Three fasting women gave birth before their 37th week of
pregnancy, compared with one in the non-fasting group, but the
researchers say that difference could have been due to chance.On average, fasting women's babies weighed about 3 kg
(around 6.8 lb), compared with the babies of non-fasting women,
who averaged 3.2 kg (7 lb).One possible explanation for the difference is that fasting
mothers tended to gain less weight during the Ramadan period,
1.6 kg versus 2.3 kg among non-fasting women.While the researchers cannot say what a low birth weight
could mean for babies later on in life, Nassar noted that it has
been linked to heart disease. Other effects of fasting during
pregnancy may not be immediate and there could be other
consequences as the child grows.More study is needed, Nassar said. The fasting period in
Ramadan can vary considerably, from 10 to 19 hours depending on
what time of year the fasting month falls, and in what part of
the globe a woman is in.Moreover, different cultures have different traditions
regarding feasting at night to break the fast, so it's hard to
generalize about the calorie and nutrition intake of all fasting
women during Ramadan.
