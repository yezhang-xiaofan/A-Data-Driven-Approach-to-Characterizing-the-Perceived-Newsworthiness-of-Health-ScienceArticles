 Women who use tanning salons have
a somewhat increased risk of skin cancer, according to a U.S.
study that adds to evidence that baking in a tan bed can be as
bad as baking under the sun.The study, by a team at Harvard Medical School, looked at
data from nearly 730,000 U.S. nurses followed for 20 years and
found that women who used tanning beds in their youth were more
likely than others to develop skin cancer -- basal cell
carcinoma in particular.Though many studies have linked tanning beds to a higher
skin cancer risk, the link to basal cell carcinoma, by far the
most common form of skin cancer, have been inconsistent."We ... investigated whether frequency of tanning bed use
during high school/college and at ages 25 to 36 years were
associated with a risk of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell
carcinoma and melanoma," wrote Jiali Han and colleagues in the
Journal of Clinical Oncology."Our data provide evidence for a dose-response relationship
between tanning bed use and the risk of skin cancers, especially
basal cell carcinoma, and the association is stronger for
patients with a younger age at exposure."Women who used tanning beds at least four times per year
between high school and age 35 were 15 percent more likely to
develop basal cell carcinoma than non-users.There were similar risks tied to melanoma and squamous cell
carcinoma, a skin cancer that, like basal cell, has a high cure
rate. But with melanoma the finding was not statistically
significant, which means it could be due to chance.Of the 730,000 women, just 349 were diagnosed with melanoma,
the deadliest form of skin cancer, during the study. That
compared with 5,500 diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma."This is a very large, well-done study that supports prior
findings that indoor tanning is associated with developing
melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma," said June Robinson, a
research professor of dermatology at Northwestern University in
Chicago, who was not involved in the study.An important finding was that the risk seemed to climb with
just a few trips to the tanning salon each year."Many (people) tan 20 or more times per year," she noted.The findings also suggested that there may be a greater risk
the earlier a person starts tanning.Women who had used tanning beds at least seven times a year
during high school and college were 73 percent more likely than
non-users to eventually be diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma.The findings, Han's team wrote, support the idea of warning
the public against future use of tanning beds and boost the
argument for restrictions on salons.A number of countries have banned minors from using tanning
beds, the researchers noted. Last year, California became the
first U.S. state to ban anyone under 18-years-old from using
indoor tanning devices.
