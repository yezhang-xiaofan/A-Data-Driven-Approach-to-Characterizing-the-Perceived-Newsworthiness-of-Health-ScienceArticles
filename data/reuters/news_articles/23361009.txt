 Jan 29 British and Chinese scientists
have found a genetic variant which explains why Chinese
populations may be more vulnerable to the H1N1 virus, commonly
known as swine flu.The discovery of the variant could help doctors find those
people at high risk of severe flu and prioritise them for
treatment, researchers said.It may also help explain why new strains of flu virus often
emerge first in Asia, where the variant known as rs12252-C is
more common in the population than elsewhere, they said."Understanding why some people may be worse affected than
others is crucial in improving our ability to manage flu
epidemics and to prevent people dying from the virus," said Tao
Dong at Britain's Oxford University, who led the study.The research, published in the journal Nature Communications
on Tuesday, found that having the rs12252-C variant could
increase the chances of severe infection by six times.H1N1 swine flu swept around the world in 2009 and 2010. A
study published last week estimated at least one in five people
worldwide were infected and around 200,000 killed in the first
year of the outbreak, which was declared a pandemic by the World
Health Organisation in June 2009.Previous research has found that rs12252-C is linked to more
severe flu infections.For this study, researchers focused on the variant because
it is 100 times more common in Han Chinese, the predominant
ethnic group in China, than in Caucasian populations indigenous
to West Asia and Europe. The variant is present in the genetic
make-up of about 1 in 3,000 people in Caucasian populations.The results showed it was present in 69 percent of Chinese
patients with severe pandemic H1N1 in 2009 compared with 25
percent who only had a mild version of the infection.Andrew McMichael of Oxford's human immunology unit said
further studies are now needed to look in more detail at the
gene variant's effect on flu severity in different populations."It remains to be seen how this gene affects the whole
picture of influenza in China and South East Asia but it might
help explain why new influenza viruses often first appear in
this region of the world," he said in a statement.
