* Gene explains only part of Alzheimer's risk* Findings need to be confirmed* Results show potential link with cholesterolBy CHICAGO, April 9 (Reuters) - The largest study to date
looking for genetic causes of Alzheimer's in African Americans
may offer new clues about why blacks in the United States are
twice as likely as whites to develop the deadly, brain-wasting
disease.The findings, published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association on Tuesday, show that mutations in two genes
that play a role in whites also contribute to Alzheimer's risk
in blacks. One of those, known as ABCA7, may double the risk in
blacks who have the mutation versus those who don't.Although many genes have been found to raise the risk of
Alzheimer's, most studies have been conducted in largely white
populations, and few studies have looked specifically at genes
that drive Alzheimer's in blacks. Part of that is because very
few African Americans take part in gene studies looking at
Alzheimer's risk.The latest findings will need to be confirmed by other
research teams, and critics say the study is incomplete until
that work is done.To get enough participants for the newly published study,
researchers combined genetic information from 18 different
Alzheimer's Disease Centers funded by the U.S. National
Institutes of Health. They gathered information on 6,000 African
Americans, 2,000 of whom had late-onset Alzheimer's disease, the
most common form that occurs in older people.The team then looked for genes that were most strongly
associated with Alzheimer's. The strongest link was with a
variant of a gene called apolipoprotein E or APOE, a gene that
contains instructions for making a protein that carries
cholesterol and is well-known risk factor for Alzheimer's.The team found that a variant of this gene called APOE-e4
doubled the risk of Alzheimer's in blacks, in much the same way
it does in whites.But the study also turned up another gene that has only been
weakly associated with Alzheimer's in whites. This gene, called
ABCA7, which also plays a role in the production of cholesterol
and fats, appears to have a much stronger effect in blacks."In whites, it increases risk by 10 to 20 percent, but in
African Americans, it increases risk by about 70 to 80 percent. 
It has a way larger effect size in African Americans," said Dr.
Christiane Reitz of Columbia University Medical Center, who
conducted the genetic analyses on the study.ABCA7 is also involved in cholesterol metabolism, as are
several of the genes which have been found in the past five
years or so to be linked with Alzheimer's in whites."That seems to be a pathway that is involved in Alzheimer's
disease," Reitz said.Reitz said a variant form of APOE called APOE-e4 has the
biggest effect, increasing the risk of Alzheimer's by about 200
percent. ABCA7 raised the risk by about 80 percent, and most
other genes discovered so far increase risk by 10 to 20 percent.Like other risk genes for the age-related form of
Alzheimer's, the gene explains only part of the risk and likely
will not lead to any new treatments soon. Reitz said it is clear
that hundreds of genes are at work in Alzheimer's disease."ABCA7 and APOE are not the only genes involved in
Alzheimer's disease in African Americans," Reitz said, adding
that it would take tens of thousands of participants to detect
some of the other risk genes. "What the study did show us is at
least one gene which seems to have a major effect, and that's
important to know."REPRESENTATIVE ENOUGH?The next step is to study how the ABCA7 gene works in the
brain, and the team still needs to validate the results of this
study in another independent population of blacks, something
that may be challenging.According to Neil Buckholtz, director of the division of
neuroscience at the National Institute on Aging, the study
represented all of the well characterized genetic samples of
blacks in the United States.Dr. Allan Levey, director of Emory University's Alzheimer's
Disease Research Center, said the study was significant for
being the first large-scale genetic study done in African
Americans. But he said a major limitation is that the study was
not replicated in another population of blacks to confirm the
findings, which is considered necessary to ensure its validity."Had this same study been done in whites, it would never
have been published here," said Levey, referring to JAMA, a
highly-regarded medical journal.Troy Duster, a sociologist at the University of California,
Berkeley and author of "Backdoor to Eugenics" and contributor to
"Whitewashing Race: The Myth of a Color-Blind Society," says the
findings are too preliminary and the effect sizes too small to
draw any definitive conclusions about differences in the risk of
Alzheimer's between blacks and whites.Without a replicating study in other groups who identify as
African-American and as white, "it is impossible to interpret
whether this small difference has significant meaning, or points
to different etiologies (or the need for different treatments)
in different groups," he said.Heather Snyder, director of medical and scientific
operations at the Alzheimer's Association, which funded two of
the study authors, said the findings should spur new research
into the potential reasons for this link between ABCA7 and
Alzheimer's in African Americans."Really, that all requires more funding for Alzheimer's
disease research," Snyder said.
