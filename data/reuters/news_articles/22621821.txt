* Skin reprogrammed into stem cells to try to mend hearts* New heart cells able to integrate with existing tissue* Many years' work ahead before clinical trials could startBy LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - Scientists have for the first
time succeeded in taking skin cells from patients with heart
failure and transforming them into healthy, beating heart tissue
that could one day be used to treat the condition.The researchers, based in Haifa, Israel, said there were
still many years of testing and refining ahead. But the results
meant they might eventually be able to reprogram patients' cells
to repair their own damaged hearts."We have shown that it's possible to take skin cells from an
elderly patient with advanced heart failure and end up with his
own beating cells in a laboratory dish that are healthy and
young - the equivalent to the stage of his heart cells when he
was just born," said Lior Gepstein from the Technion-Israel
Institute of Technology, who led the work.The researchers, whose study was published in the European
Heart Journal on Wednesday, said clinical trials of the
technique could begin within 10 years.Heart failure is a debilitating condition in which the heart
is unable to pump enough blood around the body. It has become
more prevalent in recent decades as advances medical science
mean many more people survive heart attacks.At the moment, people with severe heart failure have to rely
on mechanical devices or hope for a transplant.Researchers have been studying stem cells from various
sources for more than a decade, hoping to capitalise on their
ability to transform into a wide variety of other kinds of cell
to treat a range of health conditions.There are two main forms of stem cells - embryonic stem
cells, which are harvested from embryos, and reprogrammed "human
induced pluripotent stem cells" (hiPSCs), often originally from
skin or blood.TISSUES BEATING TOGETHERGepstein's  team took skin cells from two men with heart
failure - aged 51 and 61 - and transformed them by adding three
genes and then a small molecule called valproic acid to the cell
nucleus.They found that the resulting hiPSCs were able to
differentiate to become heart muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes,
just as effectively as hiPSCs that had been developed from
healthy, young volunteers who acted as controls for the study.The team was then able to make the cardiomyocytes develop
into heart muscle tissue, which they grew in a laboratory dish
together with existing cardiac tissue.Within 24 to 48 hours the two types of tissue were beating
together, they said.In a final step of the study, the new tissue was
transplanted into healthy rat hearts and the researchers found
it began to establish connections with cells in the host tissue."We hope that hiPSCs derived cardiomyocytes will not be
rejected following transplantation into the same patients from
which they were derived," Gepstein said. "Whether this will be
the case or not is the focus of active investigation."Experts in stem cell and cardiac medicine who were not
involved in Gepstein's work praised it but also said there was a
lot to do before it had a chance of becoming an effective
treatment."This is an interesting paper, but very early and it's
really important for patients that the promise of such a
technique is not over-sold," said John Martin a professor of
cardiovascular medicine at University College London."The chances of translation are slim and if it does work it
would take around 15 years to come to clinic."Nicholas Mills, a consultant cardiologist at Edinburgh
University said the technology needs to be refined before it
could be used for patients with heart failure, but added: "These
findings are encouraging and take us a step closer to ...
identifying an effective means of repairing the heart."
