* Preterm birth risk lower after each phase of smoking ban* Findings suggest smoke-free laws have early health impact* Other studies also found effect on asthma, heart attacksBy LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Banning smoking in enclosed
public places can lead to lower rates of preterm birth,
according to Belgian researchers who say the findings point to
health benefits of smoke-free laws even in very early life.It is well known that smoking during pregnancy can stunt the
growth of unborn babies and shorten gestation, and that
second-hand smoke exposure can also effect births, but little
was known about the impact of smoking bans on preterm birth
rates.So a team of researchers led by Tim Nawrot of Belgium's
Hasselt University investigated trends in preterm births -
before 37 weeks gestation - from 2002 to 2011 covering a period
before, during and after the introduction of smoke-free laws.They found the risk of preterm birth after the introduction
of each phase of Belgium's smoking ban, which was implemented in
three phases - in public places and most workplaces in January
2006, in restaurants in January 2007, and in bars serving food
in January 2010.No decreasing trend in preterm was evident in the years or
months before the bans, the researchers said in their study in
the British Medical Journal on Friday."Our study shows a consistent pattern of reduction in the
risk of preterm delivery with successive population
interventions to restrict smoking," the researchers wrote."It supports the notion that smoking bans have public health
benefits even from early life."Smoking causes lung cancer, often fatal, and other chronic
respiratory diseases. It is also a major risk factor for
cardiovascular diseases, the world's number one killers.According to the World Health Organisation, tobacco already
kills around 6 million people a year worldwide, including more
than 600,000 non-smokers who die from exposure to second-hand
smoke. By 2030, if current trends continue, it predicts tobacco
could kill 8 million people a year.Public health experts hope that as more and more countries
in Europe and around the world adopt stricter legislation on
smoking in public places, the health benefits will start to
become evident fairly swiftly.A study from England published last month found that the
introduction of smoking bans there led to swift and dramatic
falls in the number of children admitted to hospital suffering
asthma attacks.And research published in 2009 also found the ban on smoking
in public places in England led to a swift and significant drop
in the number of heart attacks, saving the national health
service 8.4 million pounds ($13.1 million) in the first year.The Belgian researchers analysed 606,877 live, single-born
babies delivered at between 24 and 44 weeks of gestation in
Flanders from 2002 to 2011.The results show a reduction in the risk of preterm births
of 3.13 percent after January 2007, and a further reduction in
the risk of 2.65 percent after January 2010.($1 = 0.6433 British pounds)
