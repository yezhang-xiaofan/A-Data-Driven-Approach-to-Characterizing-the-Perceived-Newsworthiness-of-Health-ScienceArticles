22177991,Eighty-year trends in infant weight and length growth: the Fels Longitudinal Study.,J Pediatr,Johnson W and Choh AC and Soloway LE and Czerwinski SA and Towne B and Demerath EW,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate secular trends in weight and length growth from birth to 3 years of age in infants born from 1930 to 2008, and to assess whether these trends were associated with concurrent trends in pace of infant skeletal maturation and maternal body mass index. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal weight and length data from 620 infants (302 girls) were analyzed with mixed effects modeling to produce growth curves and predicted anthropometry for infants born from 1930 to 1949, 1950 to 1969, 1970 to 1989, and 1990 to 2008. RESULTS: The most pronounced differences in growth occurred in the first year of life. Infants born after 1970 were approximately 450 g heavier and 1.4 cm longer at birth, but demonstrated slower growth to 1 year of age than infants born before 1970. Growth trajectories converged after 1 year of age. There was no evidence that relative skeletal age, maternal body mass index, or maternal age together mediated associations between cohort and growth. CONCLUSIONS: Recent birth cohorts may be characterized not only by greater birth size, but also by subsequent catch-down growth. Trends over time in human growth do not increase monotonically, and growth velocity in the first year may have declined compared with preceding generations.","Analysis of Variance *Birth Weight Body Composition *Body Height Body Mass Index Child Development/*physiology Cohort Studies Female Follow-Up Studies Growth and Development/*physiology Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Linear Models Longitudinal Studies Male Risk Factors Sex Factors Time Factors"
22183210,Increased live birth rate in twin pregnancies resulting from embryo assistance.,Obstet Gynecol,Miro F and Vidal E and Balasch J,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate why the live birth rate per implanted embryo is higher in twin than in singleton pregnancies. METHODS: Data from 1,159 singleton and 523 dichorionic twin pregnancies, obtained after assisted conception, were included. To account for the higher live birth rate observed in twin pregnancies, two possibilities were considered: embryo collaboration and assistance. To test these hypotheses, we compared the observed values for each possible outcome in twin pregnancies (double birth, single birth, double loss) with the expected values regarding as the null hypothesis that the survival of either embryo is independent from the presence of the other. The effect of maternal age was also examined. RESULTS: Live birth rate, per implanted embryo, was higher in twin than in singleton pregnancies: 83% compared with 76% (odds ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.24-1.88; P<.001). There were significant differences between the observed outcomes in twin pregnancies and those expected assuming no interaction between embryos (P<.001). The number of double births was higher than expected (71.9% observed compared with 57.7% expected), whereas single births were lower to a similar extent (22% observed compared with 36.5% expected). In contrast, observed and expected double losses were similar (6.1% observed compared with 5.8% expected). Although the overall rate of miscarriage was higher for women aged 34 years and older, the difference in live birth rate between twin and singleton pregnancies was 2.4-fold higher than in younger women. CONCLUSION: The higher live birth rate occurring in twin pregnancies can be accounted for by assistance, whereby some embryos that would fail as singletons survive in a twin pregnancy when implanted along with a fit sibling. This effect is more pronounced in older mothers.","Embryo Loss/epidemiology *Embryonic Development Female Humans *Live Birth Maternal Age Pregnancy Pregnancy, Twin/*physiology/statistics & numerical data *Reproductive Techniques, Assisted Retrospective Studies Spain/epidemiology"

To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated a low-saturated fatty acid (SFA) (<7% calories) diet that contains lean beef. OBJECTIVE: We studied the effect on LDL cholesterol of cholesterol-lowering diets with varying amounts of lean beef [ie, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH): 28 g beef/d; Beef in an Optimal Lean Diet (BOLD): 113 g beef/d; and Beef in an Optimal Lean Diet plus additional protein (BOLD+): 153 g beef/d] compared with that of a healthy American diet (HAD). DESIGN: Thirty-six hypercholesterolemic participants (with LDL-cholesterol concentrations >2.8 mmol/L) were randomly assigned to consume each of the 4 diets (HAD: 33% total fat, 12% SFA, 17% protein, and 20 g beef/d), DASH (27% total fat, 6% SFA, 18% protein, and 28 g beef/d), BOLD (28% total fat, 6% SFA, 19% protein, and 113 g beef/d), and BOLD+ (28% total fat, 6% SFA, 27% protein, and 153 g beef/d) for 5 wk. RESULTS: There was a decrease in total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol concentrations (P < 0.05) after consumption of the DASH (-0.49 +/- 0.11 and -0.37 +/- 0.09 mmol/L, respectively), BOLD (-0.48 +/- 0.10 and -0.35 +/- 0.9 mmol/L, respectively), and BOLD+ (-0.50 +/- 0.10 and -0.345 +/- 0.09 mmol/L, respectively) diets compared with after consumption of the HAD (-0.22 +/- 0.10 and -0.14 +/- 0.10 mmol/L, respectively). Apolipoprotein A-I, C-III, and C-III bound to apolipoprotein A1 particles decreased after BOLD and BOLD+ diets compared with after the HAD, and there was a greater decrease in apolipoprotein B after consumption of the BOLD+ diet than after consumption of the HAD (P < 0.05 for both). LDL cholesterol and TC decreased after consumption of the DASH, BOLD, and BOLD+ diets when the baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration was <1 mg/L; LDL cholesterol and TC decreased when baseline CRP concentration was >1 mg/L with the BOLD and BOLD+ diets. CONCLUSIONS: Low-SFA, heart-healthy dietary patterns that contain lean beef elicit favorable effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) lipid and lipoprotein risk factors that are comparable to those elicited by a DASH dietary pattern. These results, in conjunction with the beneficial effects on apolipoprotein CVD risk factors after consumption of the BOLD and BOLD+ diets, which were greater with the BOLD+ diet, provide support for including lean beef in a heart-healthy dietary pattern.

22176841,Physical activity and other health-risk behaviors during the transition into early adulthood: a longitudinal cohort study.,Am J Prev Med,Kwan MY and Cairney J and Faulkner GE and Pullenayegum EE,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Research consistently demonstrates that physical activity declines with age. However, such declines do not occur linearly. The transition into early adulthood is one period in which disproportionate declines in physical activity have been evident, but much of our understanding of such declines among young adults has been based on either cross-sectional data or prospective studies that focus exclusively on college/university students. PURPOSE: The purpose of the current study was to use multilevel modeling to discern patterns of physical activity based on gender and educational trajectory among a nationally representative cohort of Canadian adolescents (N=640; ages at baseline, 12-15 years). Examinations of smoking and binge drinking also were conducted as a basis for comparison. METHODS: Drawn from seven cycles of the National Population Health Survey (NPHS), participants were interviewed every 2 years from 1994-1995 to 2006-2007; data analysis was conducted in 2010. RESULTS: Overall, there was a 24% decrease in physical activity (equivalent to 1 MET/day) across the 12-year period. A significant three-way time X gender X educational trajectory interaction (coefficient= -0.189, SE=0 .09, p<0.05) emerged in the physical activity analysis; main effects in time(2) (coefficient= -0.114, SE=0.01, p<0.01) and time(3) (coefficient=0.028, SE=0.01, p<0.01) were significant for binge drinking and smoking, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity decline was evident during young adults' transition into early adulthood, with declines being steepest among men who entered a college/university. Although there were increases in several health-risk behaviors during adolescence, individuals tend to grow out of binge drinking and smoking as they mature.",Adolescent Adult Age Factors Alcohol Drinking/*epidemiology Canada Child Cohort Studies Educational Status Female *Health Behavior Health Surveys Humans Longitudinal Studies Male *Motor Activity Risk-Taking Sex Factors Smoking/*epidemiology Students/statistics & numerical data Time Factors Universities Young Adult
22193170,Is illicit drug use harmful to cognitive functioning in the midadult years? A cohort-based investigation.,Am J Epidemiol,Dregan A and Gulliford MC,Missing,"From March to July of 2011, the authors investigated the prospective association between illicit drug use and cognitive functioning during the midadult years. A total of 8,992 participants who were surveyed at 42 years of age in the National Child Development Study (1999-2000) were included. The authors analyzed data on 3 cognitive functioning measures (memory index, executive functioning index, and overall cognitive index) when the participants were 50 years of age (2008-2009). Illicit drug use at 42 years of age was based on self-reported current or past use of any of 12 illicit drugs. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to estimate the association between different illicit drug use measures at 42 years of age and cognitive functioning at 50 years of age. A positive association was observed between ever (past or current) illicit drug use and cognitive functioning (beta = 0.62, P < 0.001), although the effect size was small. Even though there was no clear evidence against the null hypothesis, drug dependence (beta = -0.27, P = 0.58) and long-term illicit drug use (beta = -0.04, P = 0.87) tended to be negatively associated with cognitive functioning. At the population level, it does not appear that current illicit drug use is associated with impaired cognitive functioning in early middle age. However, the authors cannot exclude the possibility that some individuals and groups, such as those with heavier or more prolonged use, could be harmed.",Adult Cognition/*drug effects Humans Middle Aged Prospective Studies Regression Analysis Street Drugs/*adverse effects

DATA SOURCES: Prospective studies were identified from searches in PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central, and Sportdiscus from 1990 through 2010. STUDY SELECTION: We screened the titles and abstracts for eligibility, rated the methodological quality of the studies, and extracted data. MAIN EXPOSURE: Studies had to report at least 1 physical activity or physical fitness measurement during childhood or adolescence. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Studies had to report at least 1 academic performance or cognition measure during childhood or adolescence. RESULTS: We identified 10 observational and 4 intervention studies. The quality score of the studies ranged from 22% to 75%. Two studies were scored as high quality. Methodological quality scores were particularly low for the reliability and validity of the measurement instruments. Based on the results of the best-evidence synthesis, we found evidence of a significant longitudinal positive relationship between physical activity and academic performance. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in physical activity is positively related to academic performance in children. Because we found only 2 high-quality studies, future high-quality studies are needed to confirm our findings. These studies should thoroughly examine the dose-response relationship between physical activity and academic performance as well as explanatory mechanisms for this relationship.",*Achievement Adolescent Child *Cognition Exercise/*psychology Humans Physical Fitness/*psychology Schools

However, there is contradictory evidence concerning the relation between the intake of soy food, which is rich in isoflavones, and gastric cancer. The association with gastric cancer might differ between isoflavones and soy foods, and research on the effects of isoflavone intake alone on gastric cancer is needed. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between isoflavone intake and the incidence of gastric cancer. DESIGN: We conducted a large, population-based prospective study of 39,569 men and 45,312 women aged 45-74 y. Dietary soy and isoflavone intakes were measured by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire in 1995 and 1998. RESULTS: During 806,550 person-years of follow-up, we identified 1249 new gastric cancer cases. Isoflavone intake was not associated with gastric cancer in either men or women. Compared with the lowest quartile, the HR and 95% CI for developing gastric cancer in the fourth quartile of isoflavone intake was 1.00 (0.81, 1.24) for men and 1.07 (0.77, 1.50) for women. In a stratified analysis by exogenous female hormones (women only), however, we found an increasing trend in risk of gastric cancer associated with higher isoflavone intakes among exogenous female hormone users (P-trend = 0.03) but not for nonusers (P-interaction = 0.04).

Previously published data have demonstrated that American football players have less glucose intolerance, less smoking, similar lipid profiles, and higher blood pressure despite a much larger body compared to the general population, although the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis in these subjects has not been evaluated. This study compared the prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis in active professional American football players to that in age-, gender-, and race-matched controls derived from the Bogalusa Heart Study. Carotid intimal-medial thickness (CIMT) was used as an indicator of subclinical atherosclerosis in 75 active American football players (23 to 35 years old, 31 white, 44 African-American) as measured by B-mode ultrasonography at Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona, on September 13 and 14, 2009. CIMT measurements of 75 athletes were compared to those of 518 matched controls who had CIMT determinations in 1995 and 1996. Two-group t tests determined population similarities between groups. In a generalized linear model, players (overall and by race) had lower CIMT values than controls after age and race adjustment (p <0.001 for all comparisons). Nonlinemen and linemen had lower CIMT values than controls (p < 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively). In conclusion, active professional American football players, regardless of position, had mean CIMT values similar to or lower than those in a matched general population cohort, suggesting that if the prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis is increased in retired professional American football players, this occurs after retirement.",Adult Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology Carotid Arteries/*ultrasonography Carotid Intima-Media Thickness/*statistics & numerical data Female *Football Humans Incidence Male Retrospective Studies Risk Factors United States/epidemiology Young Adult

Weight loss might protect against cardiovascular events, but solid evidence is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To study the association between bariatric surgery, weight loss, and cardiovascular events. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study is an ongoing, nonrandomized, prospective, controlled study conducted at 25 public surgical departments and 480 primary health care centers in Sweden of 2010 obese participants who underwent bariatric surgery and 2037 contemporaneously matched obese controls who received usual care. Patients were recruited between September 1, 1987, and January 31, 2001. Date of analysis was December 31, 2009, with median follow-up of 14.7 years (range, 0-20 years). Inclusion criteria were age 37 to 60 years and a body mass index of at least 34 in men and at least 38 in women. Exclusion criteria were identical in surgery and control patients. Surgery patients underwent gastric bypass (13.2%), banding (18.7%), or vertical banded gastroplasty (68.1%), and controls received usual care in the Swedish primary health care system. Physical and biochemical examinations and database cross-checks were undertaken at preplanned intervals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point of the SOS study (total mortality) was published in 2007. Myocardial infarction and stroke were predefined secondary end points, considered separately and combined. RESULTS: Bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced number of cardiovascular deaths (28 events among 2010 patients in the surgery group vs 49 events among 2037 patients in the control group; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29-0.76; P = .002).

Adenovirus/poxvirus and adenovirus/adenovirus-vector-based vaccines expressing SIV(SME543) Gag, Pol and Env antigens resulted in an 80% or greater reduction in the per-exposure probability of infection against repetitive, intrarectal SIV(MAC251) challenges in rhesus monkeys. Protection against acquisition of infection showed distinct immunological correlates compared with post-infection virological control and required the inclusion of Env in the vaccine regimen.

Many studies suggest that host T cell responses are critical for spontaneous resolution of disease, and preclinical studies have indicated a requirement for T cells in protection against challenge. We aimed to elicit HCV-specific T cells with the potential for protection using a recombinant adenoviral vector strategy in a phase 1 study of healthy human volunteers. Two adenoviral vectors expressing NS proteins from HCV genotype 1B were constructed based on rare serotypes [human adenovirus 6 (Ad6) and chimpanzee adenovirus 3 (ChAd3)]. Both vectors primed T cell responses against HCV proteins; these T cell responses targeted multiple proteins and were capable of recognizing heterologous strains (genotypes 1A and 3A). HCV-specific T cells consisted of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets; secreted interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha; and could be sustained for at least a year after boosting with the heterologous adenoviral vector. Studies using major histocompatibility complex peptide tetramers revealed long-lived central and effector memory pools that retained polyfunctionality and proliferative capacity. These data indicate that an adenoviral vector strategy can induce sustained T cell responses of a magnitude and quality associated with protective immunity and open the way for studies of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines for HCV.","Adenoviridae/*metabolism CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology Cell Proliferation Genotype HEK293 Cells Hepacivirus/*genetics Hepatitis C/*prevention & control/virology Humans Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis Interleukin-2/biosynthesis Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology T-Lymphocytes/*virology Time Factors Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism Viral Hepatitis Vaccines/*therapeutic use"

A total of 1,638,910 new cancer cases and 577,190 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2012. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2004-2008), overall cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8% per year in men and by 1.6% per year in women. Over the past 10 years of available data (1999-2008), cancer death rates have declined by more than 1% per year in men and women of every racial/ethnic group with the exception of American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom rates have remained stable. The most rapid declines in death rates occurred among African American and Hispanic men (2.4% and 2.3% per year, respectively). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate), with lung cancer accounting for almost 40% of the total decline in men and breast cancer accounting for 34% of the total decline in women. The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of about 1,024,400 deaths from cancer. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population, with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket.","Adolescent Adult Age Distribution Aged Aged, 80 and over American Cancer Society Child Child, Preschool Female Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Morbidity/trends Neoplasms/*epidemiology *Registries Retrospective Studies Sex Distribution Survival Rate/trends United States/epidemiology Young Adult"

METHODS: Three hundred fifty-nine mother/child pairs participated in a prospective birth cohort study. Sleep questionnaires were administered to mothers when children were 6, 12, 24, and 36 months old. Sleep variables included parent response to a nonspecific query about the presence/absence of a sleep problem and 8 specific sleep outcome domains: sleep onset latency, sleep maintenance, 24-hour sleep duration, daytime sleep/naps, sleep location, restlessness/vocalization, nightmares/night terrors, and snoring. RESULTS: Prevalence of a parent-reported sleep problem was 10% at all assessment intervals. Night wakings and shorter sleep duration were associated with a parent-reported sleep problem during infancy and early toddlerhood (6-24 months), whereas nightmares and restless sleep emerged as associations with report of a sleep problem in later developmental periods (24-36 months). Prolonged sleep latency was associated with parent report of a sleep problem throughout the study period. In contrast, napping, sleep location, and snoring were not associated with parent-reported sleep problems. Twenty-one percent of children with sleep problems in infancy (compared with 6% of those without) had sleep problems in the third year of life. CONCLUSIONS: Ten percent of children are reported to have a sleep problem at any given point during early childhood, and these problems persist in a significant minority of children throughout early development. Parent response to a single-item nonspecific sleep query may overlook relevant sleep behaviors and symptoms associated with clinical morbidity.","Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Male Mass Screening Prospective Studies Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/diagnosis/epidemiology Sleep Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology"

This study aimed to assess whether using an e-cigarette for 5 min has an impact on the pulmonary function tests and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (Feno) of healthy adult smokers. METHODS: Thirty healthy smokers (aged 19-56 years, 14 men) participated in this laboratory-based experimental vs control group study. Ab lib use of an e-cigarette for 5 min with the cartridge included (experimental group, n = 30) or removed from the device (control group, n = 10) was assessed. RESULTS: Using an e-cigarette for 5 min led to an immediate decrease in Feno within the experimental group by 2.14 ppb (P = .005) but not in the control group (P = .859). Total respiratory impedance at 5 Hz in the experimental group was found to also increase by 0.033 kPa/(L/s) (P < .001), and flow respiratory resistance at 5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 20 Hz also statistically increased. Regression analyses controlling for baseline measurements indicated a statistically significant decrease in Feno and an increase in impedance by 0.04 kPa/(L/s) (P = .003), respiratory resistance at 5 Hz by 0.04 kPa/(L/s) (P = .003), at 10 Hz by 0.034 kPa/(L/s) (P = .008), at 20 Hz by 0.043 kPa/(L/s) (P = .007), and overall peripheral airway resistance (beta, 0.042 kPa/[L/s]; P = .024), after using an e-cigarette. CONCLUSIONS: e-Cigarettes assessed in the context of this study were found to have immediate adverse physiologic effects after short-term use that are similar to some of the effects seen with tobacco smoking; however, the long-term health effects of e-cigarette use are unknown but potentially adverse and worthy of further investigation.","Adult Airway Resistance Female Humans Male Middle Aged Nitric Oxide/*analysis Regression Analysis Respiratory Function Tests Smoking/*adverse effects Statistics, Nonparametric Tobacco Use Cessation Products/*adverse effects"

Based on the trend, the predicted rate of discharges for intussusception in 2009 was 36.0 (95% CI, 30.2-41.8) per 100,000 infants. The measured rate of hospital discharges for intussusception in 2009 was 33.3 (95% CI, 29.0-37.6) per 100,000 infants. CONCLUSION: The reintroduction of rotavirus vaccine since 2006 has not resulted in a detectable increase in the number of hospital discharges for intussusception among US infants.","Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems Cross-Sectional Studies Female Hospitalization/*trends Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Inpatients/*statistics & numerical data Intussusception/*epidemiology/etiology Male Retreatment Retrospective Studies Rotavirus Infections/*prevention & control Rotavirus Vaccines/*adverse effects United States/epidemiology"
22170357,Effects of breastfeeding and low sugar-sweetened beverage intake on obesity prevalence in Hispanic toddlers.,Am J Clin Nutr,Davis JN and Whaley SE and Goran MI,usc,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the independent and additive effects of breastfeeding (BF) and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake in early life on overweight and obesity prevalence. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the effects of BF and SSB intake on the prevalence of overweight and obesity in Hispanic toddlers. DESIGN: Nutrition data were collected via phone surveys with caregivers of 1483 Hispanic children (2-4 y of age) from the Los Angeles County Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. BF history at 2-4 y of age was categorized as follows: no BF, >1 wk to <6 mo BF, 6 to <12 mo BF, and >/=12 mo BF. SSB intake at 2-4 y of age was categorized as follows: high SSB (>/=2 SSBs/d), mid SSB (1 SSB/d), and no SSB. The height and weight of the children were measured by WIC staff and stored in the Integrated Statewide Information System. Binary logistic regressions assessed the effects of BF and SSB categories on overweight and obesity prevalence. RESULTS: In comparison with the no-BF participants, the odds of obesity were lower in the >/=12-mo-BF participants (OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.83; P = 0.004). In comparison with high-SSB participants, the odds of obesity were lower in the no-SSB participants (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.47, 1.00; P = 0.047). In comparison with the combined no-BF/high-SSB participants, the odds of obesity were lower in the >/=12-mo BF/no-SSB participants (OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.80; P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that BF for >/=1 y and low SSB intake during the toddler years can have profound effects on reducing the prevalence of obesity in Hispanic toddlers.","*Beverages *Breast Feeding *Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena Child Welfare Child, Preschool *Diet Diet Surveys Dietary Sucrose/*adverse effects *Energy Intake Female Hispanic Americans Humans Logistic Models Los Angeles/epidemiology Male Obesity/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control Odds Ratio Prevalence"

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Flushing, New York. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 212 preschool children as a part of the ongoing cohort study. MAIN EXPOSURES: Gestational diabetes mellitus and low SES. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes are ADHD diagnosis based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) criteria at age 6 years and several well-validated measures of neurobehavioral outcomes, cognitive functioning, ADHD symptoms, and temperament at age 4 years. Secondary outcomes are parent and teacher reports of behavioral and emotional problems at age 6 years. Neurobehavioral measures in relation to GDM and low SES were examined using generalized estimating equations and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Both maternal GDM and low SES were associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk for ADHD at age 6 years. However, the risk by GDM was greater among lower SES families than among higher SES families. Children exposed to both GDM and low SES demonstrated compromised neurobehavioral functioning, including lower IQ, poorer language, and impoverished behavioral and emotional functioning. A test of additive interaction found that the risk for ADHD increased over 14-fold (P = .006) when children were exposed to both GDM and low SES. Neither children exposed to maternal GDM alone nor those exposed to low SES alone had a notable increased risk for ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal GDM and low SES, especially in combination, heighten the risk for childhood ADHD. Long-term prevention efforts should be directed at mothers with GDM to avoid suboptimal neurobehavioral development and mitigate the risk for ADHD among their offspring.","Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/economics/epidemiology/*etiology *Child Development Child, Preschool Cognition/*physiology Diabetes, Gestational/*epidemiology Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male New York/epidemiology Parents/*psychology *Poverty Pregnancy Prevalence Risk Factors Socioeconomic Factors"
22223828,Timing of onset of cognitive decline: results from Whitehall II prospective cohort study.,BMJ,Singh-Manoux A and Kivimaki M and Glymour MM and Elbaz A and Berr C and Ebmeier KP and Ferrie JE and Dugravot A,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate 10 year decline in cognitive function from longitudinal data in a middle aged cohort and to examine whether age cohorts can be compared with cross sectional data to infer the effect of age on cognitive decline. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. At study inception in 1985-8, there were 10,308 participants, representing a recruitment rate of 73%. SETTING: Civil service departments in London, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 5198 men and 2192 women, aged 45-70 at the beginning of cognitive testing in 1997-9. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Tests of memory, reasoning, vocabulary, and phonemic and semantic fluency, assessed three times over 10 years. RESULTS: All cognitive scores, except vocabulary, declined in all five age categories (age 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, and 65-70 at baseline), with evidence of faster decline in older people. In men, the 10 year decline, shown as change/range of test x 100, in reasoning was -3.6% (95% confidence interval -4.1% to -3.0%) in those aged 45-49 at baseline and -9.6% (-10.6% to -8.6%) in those aged 65-70. In women, the corresponding decline was -3.6% (-4.6% to -2.7%) and -7.4% (-9.1% to -5.7%). Comparisons of longitudinal and cross sectional effects of age suggest that the latter overestimate decline in women because of cohort differences in education. For example, in women aged 45-49 the longitudinal analysis showed reasoning to have declined by -3.6% (-4.5% to -2.8%) but the cross sectional effects suggested a decline of -11.4% (-14.0% to -8.9%).

The objective of this study was to compare the risks of problems with continence and sexual function following these procedures among Medicare-age men. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A population-based random sample was drawn from the 20% Medicare claims files for August 1, 2008, through December 31, 2008. Participants had hospital and physician claims for radical prostatectomy and diagnostic codes for prostate cancer and reported undergoing either a robotic or open surgery. They received a mail survey that included self-ratings of problems with continence and sexual function a median of 14 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Completed surveys were obtained from 685 (86%) of 797 eligible participants, and 406 and 220 patients reported having had robotic or open surgery, respectively. Overall, 189 (31.1%; 95% CI, 27.5% to 34.8%) of 607 men reported having a moderate or big problem with continence, and 522 (88.0%; 95% CI, 85.4% to 90.6%) of 593 men reported having a moderate or big problem with sexual function. In logistic regression models predicting the log odds of a moderate or big problem with postoperative continence and adjusting for age and educational level, robotic prostatectomy was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward greater problems with continence (odds ratio [OR] 1.41; 95% CI, 0.97 to 2.05). Robotic prostatectomy was not associated with greater problems with sexual function (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.49). CONCLUSION: Risks of problems with continence and sexual function are high after both procedures.

OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine whether oral FA + vitamin B-12 supplementation prevented cognitive decline in a cohort of community-dwelling older adults with elevated psychological distress. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a completely crossed 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design comprising daily oral 400 mug FA + 100 mug vitamin B-12 supplementation (compared with placebo), physical activity promotion, and depression literacy with comparator control interventions for reducing depressive symptoms was conducted in 900 adults aged 60-74 y with elevated psychological distress (Kessler Distress 10-Scale; scores >15). The 2-y intervention was delivered in 10 modules via mail with concurrent telephone tracking calls. Main outcome measures examined change in cognitive functioning at 12 and 24 mo by using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-Modified (TICS-M) and the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (processing speed); the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly was administered at 24 mo. RESULTS: FA + vitamin B-12 improved the TICS-M total (P = 0.032; effect size d = 0.17), TICS-M immediate (P = 0.046; d = 0.15), and TICS-M delayed recall (P = 0.013; effect size d = 0.18) scores at 24 mo in comparison with placebo. No significant changes were evident in orientation, attention, semantic memory, processing speed, or informant reports. CONCLUSION: Long-term supplementation of daily oral 400 mug FA + 100 mug vitamin B-12 promotes improvement in cognitive functioning after 24 mo, particularly in immediate and delayed memory performance.

We assessed the efficacy of acupuncture at migraine-specific acupuncture points compared with other acupuncture points and sham acupuncture. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, single-blind randomized controlled trial. In total, 480 patients with migraine were randomly assigned to one of four groups (Shaoyang-specific acupuncture, Shaoyang-nonspecific acupuncture, Yangming-specific acupuncture or sham acupuncture [control]). All groups received 20 treatments, which included electrical stimulation, over a period of four weeks. The primary outcome was the number of days with a migraine experienced during weeks 5-8 after randomization. Our secondary outcomes included the frequency of migraine attack, migraine intensity and migraine-specific quality of life. RESULTS: Compared with patients in the control group, patients in the acupuncture groups reported fewer days with a migraine during weeks 5-8, however the differences between treatments were not significant (p > 0.05). There was a significant reduction in the number of days with a migraine during weeks 13-16 in all acupuncture groups compared with control (Shaoyang-specific acupuncture v. control: difference -1.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) -1.77 to -0.5], p = 0.003; Shaoyang-nonspecific acupuncture v. control: difference -1.22 [95% CI -1.92 to -0.52], p < 0.001; Yangming-specific acupuncture v. control: difference -0.91 [95% CI -1.61 to -0.21], p = 0.011). We found that there was a significant, but not clinically relevant, benefit for almost all secondary outcomes in the three acupuncture groups compared with the control group. We found no relevant differences between the three acupuncture groups.

We systematically evaluated the risk of MI or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with the use of dabigatran. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science for randomized controlled trials of dabigatran that reported on MI or ACS as secondary outcomes. The fixed-effects Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) test was used to evaluate the effect of dabigatran on MI or ACS. We expressed the associations as odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs. RESULTS: Seven trials were selected (N = 30,514), including 2 studies of stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation, 1 in acute venous thromboembolism, 1 in ACS, and 3 of short-term prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis. Control arms included warfarin, enoxaparin, or placebo administration. Dabigatran was significantly associated with a higher risk of MI or ACS than that seen with agents used in the control group (dabigatran, 237 of 20,000 [1.19%] vs control, 83 of 10,514 [0.79%]; OR(M-H), 1.33; 95% CI, 1.03-1.71; P = .03). The risk of MI or ACS was similar when using revised RE-LY trial results (OR(M-H), 1.27; 95% CI, 1.00-1.61; P = .05) or after exclusion of short-term trials (OR(M-H), 1.33; 95% CI, 1.03-1.72; P = .03). Risks were not heterogeneous for all analyses (I(2) = 0%; P >/= .30) and were consistent using different methods and measures of association. CONCLUSIONS: Dabigatran is associated with an increased risk of MI or ACS in a broad spectrum of patients when tested against different controls.

22205310,Maternal phenylketonuria and hyperphenylalaninemia in pregnancy: pregnancy complications and neonatal sequelae in untreated and treated pregnancies.,Am J Clin Nutr,Prick BW and Hop WC and Duvekot JJ,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Untreated maternal phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia may result in nonphenylketonuric offspring with neonatal sequelae, especially intellectual disability, microcephaly, and congenital heart disease (CHD). Dietary treatment to control phenylalanine concentrations can prevent these sequelae. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to present an overview of reported pregnancy complications and neonatal sequelae of maternal phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia in untreated and treated pregnancies. DESIGN: A MEDLINE and EMBASE search was conducted for case reports and case series that assessed maternal phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia during pregnancy. Pregnancy complications (spontaneous abortion, intrauterine-fetal-death, and preterm delivery) and neonatal sequelae [small for gestational age (SGA), microcephaly, CHD, intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDDs), and facial dysmorphism (FD)] were analyzed. Fifteen unpublished pregnancies from our clinic were added. RESULTS: We retrieved 196 pregnancies, of which 126 pregnancies were untreated and 70 pregnancies were treated. The occurrence of pregnancy complications was not significantly different between untreated and treated pregnancies. Except for SGA, all neonatal sequelae were more frequent in untreated pregnancies. Moreover, the occurrence of SGA, microcephaly, and IDDs was significantly related to the mean phenylalanine concentration in each trimester, whereas the occurrence of FD was related only to the first trimester. CONCLUSIONS: We present the largest cohort of untreated pregnant women with phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia since 1980. The results follow the general pattern reported by other researchers. We underline that the treatment of pregnant women with phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia is of great importance to prevent neonatal sequelae. We strongly recommend starting treatment before conception because we showed the deleterious effect of an increased mean first-trimester phenylalanine concentration on FD.","Congenital Abnormalities/*etiology Developmental Disabilities/etiology Facial Bones/abnormalities Female Humans Infant, Newborn Infant, Small for Gestational Age Intellectual Disability/etiology Microcephaly/etiology Phenylalanine/*blood Phenylketonuria, Maternal/blood/*therapy Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications Pregnancy Outcome Pregnancy Trimesters Skull/abnormalities"

METHODS: Using data from 5 managed care organizations for 2000 to 2009, we identified a cohort of 1.8 million children ages 6 weeks to 17 years. Potential ITP cases were identified by using diagnostic codes and platelet counts. All cases were verified by chart review. Incidence rate ratios were calculated comparing the risk of ITP in risk (1 to 42 days after vaccination) and control periods. RESULTS: There were 197 chart-confirmed ITP cases out of 1.8 million children in the cohort. There was no elevated risk of ITP after any vaccine in early childhood other than MMR in the 12- to 19-month age group. There was a significantly elevated risk of ITP after hepatitis A vaccine at 7 to 17 years of age, and for varicella vaccine and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine at 11 to 17 years of age. For hepatitis A, varicella, and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccines, elevated risks were based on one to two vaccine-exposed cases. Most cases were acute and mild with no long-term sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: ITP is unlikely after early childhood vaccines other than MMR. Because of the small number of exposed cases and potential confounding, the possible association of ITP with hepatitis A, varicella, and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccines in older children requires further investigation.","Adolescent Chickenpox Vaccine/adverse effects/immunology Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis Vaccines/adverse effects/immunology Female Hepatitis A Vaccines/adverse effects/immunology Humans Infant Male Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/*epidemiology/*etiology Retrospective Studies Risk United States Vaccination/*adverse effects"
22221950,Coronary artery disease in patients with psoriasis referred for coronary angiography.,Am J Cardiol,Armstrong AW and Harskamp CT and Ledo L and Rogers JH and Armstrong EJ,harvard,"Patients with psoriasis may have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to investigate whether psoriasis is associated with an increased prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) independent of established cardiovascular risk factors in patients undergoing coronary angiography. A retrospective cohort analysis was performed by linking records of all patients undergoing coronary angiography from 2004 through 2009 with dermatology medical records. From an overall cohort of 9,473 patients, we identified 204 patients (2.2%) with psoriasis before coronary angiography. Patients with psoriasis had higher body mass index (31.3 +/- 8.1 vs 29.3 +/- 7.1 kg/m(2), p <0.001) but the prevalence of other risk factors was similar. Median duration of psoriasis before cardiac catheterization was 8 years (interquartile range 2 to 24). Patients with psoriasis were more likely to have CAD (84.3% vs 75.7%, p = 0.005) at coronary angiography. After adjusting for established cardiovascular risk factors, psoriasis was independently associated with presence of angiographically confirmed CAD (adjusted odds ratio 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8, p = 0.006). In patients with psoriasis, duration of psoriasis >8 years was also independently associated with angiographically confirmed CAD after adjusting for established cardiovascular risk factors (adjusted odds ratio 3.5, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 9.6, p = 0.02).

OBJECTIVE: To analyze associations between marijuana (both current and lifetime exposure) and pulmonary function. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a longitudinal study collecting repeated measurements of pulmonary function and smoking over 20 years (March 26, 1985-August 19, 2006) in a cohort of 5115 men and women in 4 US cities. Mixed linear modeling was used to account for individual age-based trajectories of pulmonary function and other covariates including tobacco use, which was analyzed in parallel as a positive control. Lifetime exposure to marijuana joints was expressed in joint-years, with 1 joint-year of exposure equivalent to smoking 365 joints or filled pipe bowls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration (FEV(1)) and forced vital capacity (FVC). RESULTS: Marijuana exposure was nearly as common as tobacco exposure but was mostly light (median, 2-3 episodes per month). Tobacco exposure, both current and lifetime, was linearly associated with lower FEV(1) and FVC. In contrast, the association between marijuana exposure and pulmonary function was nonlinear (P < .001): at low levels of exposure, FEV(1) increased by 13 mL/joint-year (95% CI, 6.4 to 20; P < .001) and FVC by 20 mL/joint-year (95% CI, 12 to 27; P < .001), but at higher levels of exposure, these associations leveled or even reversed. The slope for FEV(1) was -2.2 mL/joint-year (95% CI, -4.6 to 0.3; P = .08) at more than 10 joint-years and -3.2 mL per marijuana smoking episode/mo (95% CI, -5.8 to -0.6; P = .02) at more than 20 episodes/mo. With very heavy marijuana use, the net association with FEV(1) was not significantly different from baseline, and the net association with FVC remained significantly greater than baseline (eg, at 20 joint-years, 76 mL [95% CI, 34 to 117]; P < .001).

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of a butter naturally enriched in rTFAs, of which vaccenic acid is the predominant isomer, on plasma lipid concentrations among healthy women. DESIGN: In a double-blind, randomized, crossover controlled study, 61 healthy women aged 19-70 y were fed 2 isoenergetic diets lasting 4 wk each. The 2 diets were defined as moderately high in rTFAs (3.7 g/d, 1.5% of daily energy) and control (0.9 g/d, 0.3% of daily energy). RESULTS: No significant effect of the rTFA diet was found on total plasma cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein A-I, and triglyceride concentrations compared with the control diet. There was a small yet statistically significant reduction in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations with the rTFA diet (-2.8%; P = 0.004), which was significant (P for the BMI x treatment interaction = 0.006) among women with a BMI (in kg/m(2)) >/=25 (-5.2%; P = 0.004; n = 18) but not among women with a BMI <25 (-1.2%; P = 0.13; n = 43). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that an increase in dietary rTFAs equivalent to approximately 1% of daily energy has no significant effect on LDL but may be associated with a reduction in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations, particularly in overweight women.

Recent studies have suggested that this approach is more effective than conventional therapy alone only in severely affected patients. We determined whether these results persist at long-term follow-up. METHODS: Forty-eight nonambulant participants after subacute stroke were stratified by motricity index into high (<29) and low (>/=29) motor impairment groups. Each arm was randomized to a robotic or control group at a mean of 20 days after stroke. All patients underwent 2 therapy sessions per day, 5 days per week, for 3 months. Robotic group subjects underwent 20 sessions of robotic-assisted gait training in the first 4 weeks of inpatient therapy and abbreviated conventional therapy, whereas control group patients received only conventional gait training. The primary outcome was Functional Ambulation Category, and secondary measures were the Rivermead Mobility Index and Barthel Index scores. The scales were administered before and after the inpatient stay and 2 years after discharge. RESULTS: At follow-up, as at discharge, the low motricity robotic group improved more than the control group counterpart with regard to functional ambulation category (4.7+/-0.5 versus 3.1+/-1.5, P=0.002), Barthel Index (76.9+/-11.5 versus 64.7+/-14.0, P=0.024), and Rivermead Mobility Index (11.8+/-3.5 versus 7.0+/-3.6, P=0.010), whereas conventional and robotic therapies were equally effective in the high motricity groups. CONCLUSIONS: The higher efficacy of the combination of robotic therapy and conventional therapy versus conventional therapy alone that was observed at discharge only in patients with greater motor impairments was sustained after 2 years.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Female Follow-Up Studies *Gait Gait Disorders, Neurologic/etiology/physiopathology/*therapy Humans Male Middle Aged Physical Therapy Modalities/*instrumentation *Robotics Stroke/complications/*rehabilitation Time Factors"

We examined the association between protein sources and incidence of stroke using a proportional hazard model adjusted for stroke risk factors. RESULTS: During 26 and 22 years of follow-up in women and men, respectively, we documented 2633 and 1397 strokes, respectively. In multivariable analyses, higher intake of red meat was associated with an elevated risk of stroke, whereas a higher intake of poultry was associated with a lower risk. In models estimating the effects of exchanging different protein sources, compared with 1 serving/day of red meat, 1 serving/day of poultry was associated with a 27% (95% CI, 12%-39%) lower risk of stroke, nuts with a 17% (95% CI. 4%-27%) lower risk, fish with a 17% (95% CI, 0%-30%) lower risk, low-fat dairy with an 11% (95% CI, 5%-17%) lower risk, and whole-fat dairy with a 10% (95% CI, 4%-16%) lower risk. We did not see significant associations with exchanging legumes or eggs for red meat. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that stroke risk may be reduced by replacing red meat with other dietary sources of protein.","Adult Animals Brain Ischemia/epidemiology Cattle Cerebral Hemorrhage/epidemiology Cohort Studies Dairy Products Data Interpretation, Statistical Diet Dietary Fats/adverse effects Dietary Proteins/*adverse effects Eating Eggs Fabaceae Female Fishes Food Handling Humans Male Meat/adverse effects Middle Aged Nuts Prospective Studies Risk Sex Characteristics Smoking/adverse effects Stroke/*epidemiology Swine United States/epidemiology"
22175545,Brief opportunistic smoking cessation interventions: a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare advice to quit and offer of assistance.,Addiction,Aveyard P and Begh R and Parsons A and West R,Missing,"AIMS: This study aimed to assess the effects of opportunistic brief physician advice to stop smoking and offer of assistance on incidence of attempts to stop and quit success in smokers not selected by motivation to quit. METHODS: We included relevant trials from the Cochrane Reviews of physician advice for smoking cessation, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline and bupropion. We extracted data on quit attempts and quit success. Estimates were combined using the Mantel-Haentszel method and heterogeneity assessed with the I(2) statistic. Study quality was assessed by method of randomization, allocation concealment and follow-up blind to allocation. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included. Compared to no intervention, advice to quit on medical grounds increased the frequency of quit attempts [risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16-1.33], but not as much as behavioural support for cessation (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.52-3.11) or offering NRT (RR 1.68, 95% CI: 1.48-1.89). In a direct comparison, offering assistance generated more quit attempts than giving advice to quit on medical grounds (RR 1.69, 95% CI: 1.24-2.31 for behavioural support and 1.39, 95% CI: 1.25-1.54 for offering medication). There was evidence that medical advice increased the success of quit attempts and inconclusive evidence that offering assistance increased their success. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians may be more effective in promoting attempts to stop smoking by offering assistance to all smokers than by advising smokers to quit and offering assistance only to those who express an interest in doing so.",Behavior Therapy/methods Counseling Health Promotion/methods Humans Smoking/*prevention & control Smoking Cessation/*methods Tobacco Use Cessation Products

The nationwide Geocap case-control study included the 2,753 cases diagnosed in mainland France over 2002-2007 and 30,000 contemporaneous population controls. The last addresses were geocoded and located around the 19 NPPs. The study used distance to NPPs and a dose-based geographic zoning (DBGZ), based on the estimated dose to bone marrow related to NPP gaseous discharges. An odds ratio (OR) of 1.9 [1.0-3.3], based on 14 cases, was evidenced for children living within 5 km of NPPs compared to those living 20 km or further away, and a very similar association was observed in the concomitant incidence study (standardized incidence ratio (SIR)=1.9 [1.0-3.2]). These results were similar for all the 5-year-age groups. They persisted after stratification for several contextual characteristics of the municipalities of residence. Conversely, using the DBGZ resulted in OR and SIR close to one in all of the dose categories. There was no increase in AL incidence over 1990-2001 and over the entire 1990-2007 period. The results suggest a possible excess risk of AL in the close vicinity of French NPPs in 2002-2007. The absence of any association with the DBGZ may indicate that the association is not explained by NPP gaseous discharges. Overall, the findings call for investigation for potential risk factors related to the vicinity of NPP and collaborative analysis of multisite studies conducted in various countries.","Adolescent Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects Female Follow-Up Studies France/epidemiology Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology Male Nuclear Power Plants Prognosis Residence Characteristics Risk Factors Survival Rate"

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate airway inflammation and remodeling in elite swimmers. METHODS: Twenty-three elite swimmers were tested during off-training season. All had exhaled nitric oxide measurement, methacholine test, eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea challenge, allergy skin prick tests, and bronchoscopy with bronchial biopsies. Clinical data and tissues from 10 age-matched mild-asthmatic and 10 healthy nonallergic subjects were used for comparison. RESULTS: Swimmers had increased airway mucosa eosinophil and mast cell counts than did controls (P < .05). They had more goblet cell hyperplasia and higher mucin expression than did healthy or asthmatic subjects (P < .05). A greater submucosal type I and III collagen expression and tenascin deposition was also observed in swimmers than in controls (P < .05). Neither exhaled nitric oxide nor airway responsiveness to methacholine or eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea challenge correlated with these inflammatory and remodeling changes. CONCLUSION: Intense, long-term swimming training in indoor chlorinated swimming pools is associated with airway changes similar to those seen in mild asthma, but with higher mucin expression. These changes were independent from airway hyperresponsiveness. The long-term physiological and clinical consequences of these changes remain to be clarified.",*Airway Remodeling/immunology Allergens/immunology Asthma/immunology/*pathology/physiopathology Bronchi/immunology/metabolism/pathology Bronchial Provocation Tests Bronchoconstrictor Agents Cell Count Chlorine/*adverse effects Eosinophils/immunology Female Humans Inflammation/immunology/*pathology/physiopathology Male Mast Cells/immunology Methacholine Chloride Mucins/metabolism Neutrophils/immunology Nitric Oxide/metabolism Skin Tests Spirometry *Swimming Swimming Pools T-Lymphocytes/immunology Young Adult

Too few long-term intervention studies in humans have examined the effects of soft drinks. OBJECTIVE: We compared the effects of SSSDs with those of isocaloric milk and a noncaloric soft drink on changes in total fat mass and ectopic fat deposition (in liver and muscle tissue). DESIGN: Overweight subjects (n = 47) were randomly assigned to 4 different test drinks (1 L/d for 6 mo): SSSD (regular cola), isocaloric semiskim milk, aspartame-sweetened diet cola, and water. The amount of intrahepatic fat and intramyocellular fat was measured with (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Other endpoints were fat mass, fat distribution (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging), and metabolic risk factors. RESULTS: The relative changes between baseline and the end of 6-mo intervention were significantly higher in the regular cola group than in the 3 other groups for liver fat (132-143%, sex-adjusted mean; P < 0.01), skeletal muscle fat (117-221%; P < 0.05), visceral fat (24-31%; P < 0.05), blood triglycerides (32%; P < 0.01), and total cholesterol (11%; P < 0.01). Total fat mass was not significantly different between the 4 beverage groups. Milk and diet cola reduced systolic blood pressure by 10-15% compared with regular cola (P < 0.05). Otherwise, diet cola had effects similar to those of water. CONCLUSION: Daily intake of SSSDs for 6 mo increases ectopic fat accumulation and lipids compared with milk, diet cola, and water. Thus, daily intake of SSSDs is likely to enhance the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.

22218154,Less frequent eating predicts greater BMI and waist circumference in female adolescents.,Am J Clin Nutr,Ritchie LD,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the effect of eating frequency on adiposity. OBJECTIVE: The study aim was to assess the prospective relation of an objective measure of eating frequency with adiposity in girls from ages 9-10 to 19-20 y. DESIGN: By using data from 3-d diet records collected from 2372 girls in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study, meal, snack, and total eating frequencies aggregated over the first 2 study years were examined in relation to 10-y change in BMI and waist circumference (WC). RESULTS: Eating frequency was lower in black and older girls than in white and younger girls (P < 0.0001). In whites, lower initial snack and total eating frequencies were related to greater 10-y increases in BMI (P = 0.023 and 0.012, respectively) and WC (P = 0.030 and 0.015, respectively). In blacks, lower initial meal and snack frequencies were related to greater increases in BMI (P = 0.004 and 0.022, respectively) and WC (P = 0.052 and 0.005, respectively). Also, in blacks, lower initial total eating frequency was related to greater increases in WC (P = 0.010). After adjustment for baseline adiposity measure, race, parental education, physical activity, television and video viewing, total energy intake, and dieting for weight loss, lower initial total eating frequency remained related to greater 10-y increases in BMI (P = 0.013) and WC (P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: A lower eating frequency predicts a greater gain in adiposity in adolescent females.

STUDY DESIGN: Pregnancy outcome and occupational exposures were collected retrospectively from 8461 participants of the Nurses' Health Study II. Of these, 7482 were eligible for analysis using logistic regression. RESULTS: Participants reported 6707 live births, and 775 (10%) spontaneous abortions (<20 weeks). After adjusting for age, parity, shift work, and hours worked, antineoplastic drug exposure was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of spontaneous abortion, particularly with early spontaneous abortion before the 12th week, and 3.5-fold increased risk among nulliparous women. Exposure to sterilizing agents was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of late spontaneous abortion (12-20 weeks), but not with early spontaneous abortion.

METHODS: Using the National Inpatient Sample, we evaluated hospitalization costs for patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke in the United States from 2001 to 2008. Cost data were correlated with demographics and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke was received by 63 472 patients; 24 094 patients were younger than age 65 years and 40 780 patients were 65 years or older. Median hospital costs in 2008 dollars were $14 102 (interquartile range, $9987-$20 819) for patients with good outcome, $18 856 (interquartile range, $13 145-$30 423) for patients with severe disability, and $19 129 (interquartile range, $11 966-$30 781) for patients with in-hospital mortality. Average 2008 Medicare payments were $10 098 for intravenous thrombolysis without complication and $13 835 for intravenous thrombolysis with major complication.

22219348,Air pollution and incidence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus in black women living in Los Angeles.,Circulation,Coogan PF and White LF and Jerrett M and Brook RD and Su JG and Seto E and Burnett R and Palmer JR and Rosenberg L,bu,"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that longer-term exposure to air pollutants over years confers higher risks of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than shorter-term exposure. One explanation is that the cumulative adverse effects that develop over longer durations lead to the genesis of chronic disease. Preliminary epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that air pollution may contribute to the development of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident hypertension and diabetes mellitus associated with exposure to fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) and nitrogen oxides in a cohort of black women living in Los Angeles. Pollutant levels were estimated at participants' residential addresses with land use regression models (nitrogen oxides) and interpolation from monitoring station measurements (PM(2.5)). Over follow-up from 1995 to 2005, 531 incident cases of hypertension and 183 incident cases of diabetes mellitus occurred. When pollutants were analyzed separately, the IRR for hypertension for a 10-mug/m(3) increase in PM(2.5) was 1.48 (95% CI, 0.95-2.31), and the IRR for the interquartile range (12.4 parts per billion) of nitrogen oxides was 1.14 (95% CI, 1.03-1.25). The corresponding IRRs for diabetes mellitus were 1.63 (95% CI, 0.78-3.44) and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07-1.46). When both pollutants were included in the same model, the IRRs for PM(2.5) were attenuated and the IRRs for nitrogen oxides were essentially unchanged for both outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that exposure to air pollutants, especially traffic-related pollutants, may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and possibly of hypertension.","Adult African Americans/*statistics & numerical data Aged Air Pollution/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data Cohort Studies Confidence Intervals Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*epidemiology/ethnology Environmental Exposure Female Humans Hypertension/*epidemiology/ethnology Incidence Los Angeles/epidemiology Middle Aged Nitrogen Oxides/*adverse effects/analysis Noise/adverse effects Particulate Matter/*adverse effects/analysis Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Questionnaires Urban Population/statistics & numerical data Vehicle Emissions Young Adult"
22205315,Serving smaller age-appropriate entree portions to children aged 3-5 y increases fruit and vegetable intake and reduces energy density and energy intake at lunch.,Am J Clin Nutr,Savage JS and Fisher JO and Marini M and Birch LL,psu,"BACKGROUND: Previous portion size research in children has focused on the impact of large entree portions on children's intake, but less attention has been given to how intake at a meal is affected across a broader range of entree portions. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the effect of serving a range of entree portions on children's ad libitum intake and energy density consumed at the meal. DESIGN: A within-subject design was used to examine the effect of varying entree portions (ie, 100, 160, 220, 280, 340, and 400 g) on children's ad libitum energy intake of macaroni and cheese and fixed portions of unsweetened applesauce, green beans, and whole-wheat roll served with the entree. Seventeen children (10 girls), aged 3 to 6 y, were served a series of 6 lunches, which varied only in entree portion size, once per week. Weight, height, and weighed food intake were measured. RESULTS: Increasing portion size increased children's entree intake (P < 0.01) and decreased intake of other foods served with the entree, including fruit and vegetables (P < 0.0001). As a result, children consumed a more-energy-dense (kcal/g) lunch as portion size increased (P < 0.0001). Further examination showed that BMI percentile moderated the positive association between portion size and entree intake (P < 0.01); overweight children showed greater increases in entree intake with increasing entree portion. CONCLUSION: Serving smaller age-appropriate entree portions may be one strategy to improve children's nutritional profile by decreasing intake of energy-dense foods and by promoting intake of fruit and vegetables served with the entree.","*Body Mass Index *Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena Child, Preschool *Diet *Energy Intake Fruit Humans Overweight/physiopathology/psychology Vegetables"
22205314,Exploration of the safe upper level of iodine intake in euthyroid Chinese adults: a randomized double-blind trial.,Am J Clin Nutr,Sang Z and Wang PP and Yao Z and Shen J and Halfyard B and Tan L and Zhao N and Wu Y and Gao S and Tan J and Liu J and Chen Z and Zhang W,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The beneficial health effects associated with Universal Salt Iodization are well known. Yet, little is known about the possible adverse health effects in people with high iodine intake and the safe daily intake upper limit in the Chinese population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the safe upper level of total daily iodine intake among adults in China. DESIGN: A 4-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial was conducted in 256 euthyroid adults. Participants were randomly assigned to 12 intervention groups with various iodine supplement doses ranging from 0 to 2000 mug/d. Total iodine intake included iodine from both supplements and diet. Multiple outcome measures were used to evaluate possible adverse effects, including thyroid function, thyroid size, and urinary iodine. RESULTS: The mean iodine intake from the diets and salt intake of the participants were 105 +/- 25 and 258 +/- 101 mug/d, respectively. In comparison with the placebo group, all iodide-supplemented groups responded with significant increases in median urinary iodine concentrations (P < 0.05) and in thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration (P < 0.05). Thyroid volume decreased after 4 wk in the high-iodine intervention groups (1500-2000 mug). Subclinical hypothyroidism appeared in the groups that received 400 mug I (5%) and 500-2000 mug I (15-47%). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that subclinical hypothyroidism appeared in the participants who took the 400-mug I supplement, which provided a total iodine intake of approximately 800 mug/d. Thus, we caution against a total daily iodine intake that exceeds 800 mug/d in China and recommend further research to determine a safe daily upper limit.","Adult China/epidemiology Dietary Supplements/*adverse effects Double-Blind Method Drug Administration Schedule Female Humans Hypothyroidism/blood/*chemically induced/epidemiology Incidence Iodides/administration & dosage/adverse effects Iodine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/urine Male Organ Size Reference Values Sodium Chloride, Dietary/administration & dosage Thyroid Gland/anatomy & histology/*drug effects Thyrotropin/*blood Trace Elements/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/urine Young Adult"

Resettled refugee children in the United States are considered at high risk for elevated blood lead levels, but the prevalence of and risk factors for elevated blood lead levels before resettlement have not been described. METHODS: Blood samples from children aged 6 months to 14 years from refugee camps in Thailand were tested for lead and hemoglobin. Sixty-seven children with elevated blood lead levels (venous >/=10 microg/dL) or undetectable (capillary <3.3 microg/dL) blood lead levels participated in a case-control study. RESULTS: Of 642 children, 33 (5.1%) had elevated blood lead levels. Children aged <2 years had the highest prevalence (14.5%). Among children aged <2 years included in a case-control study, elevated blood lead levels risk factors included hemoglobin <10 g/dL, exposure to car batteries, and taking traditional medicines. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of elevated blood lead levels among tested US-bound Burmese refugee children was higher than the current US prevalence, and was especially high among children <2 years old. Refugee children may arrive in the United States with elevated blood lead levels. A population-specific understanding of preexisting lead exposures can enhance postarrival lead-poisoning prevention efforts, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for resettled refugee children, and can lead to remediation efforts overseas.","Adolescent Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/diagnosis/epidemiology/ethnology Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Emigrants and Immigrants/*statistics & numerical data Female Humans Infant Lead/blood Lead Poisoning/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*ethnology Male Myanmar/ethnology Nutritional Status Refugees/*statistics & numerical data Thailand/ethnology United States"

We hypothesized that RYGBP provides superior results. DESIGN: Matched-pair study in patients with a body mass index (BMI) less than 50. SETTING: University hospital and regional community hospital with a common bariatric surgeon. PATIENTS: Four hundred forty-two patients were matched according to sex, age, and BMI. INTERVENTIONS: Laparoscopic GB or RYGBP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Operative morbidity, weight loss, residual BMI, quality of life, food tolerance, lipid profile, and long-term morbidity. RESULTS: Follow-up was 92.3% at the end of the study period (6 years postoperatively). Early morbidity was higher after RYGBP than after GB (17.2% vs 5.4%; P<.001), but major morbidity was similar. Weight loss was quicker, maximal weight loss was greater, and weight loss remained significantly better after RYGBP until the sixth postoperative year. At 6 years, there were more failures (BMI>35 or reversal of the procedure/conversion) after GB (48.3% vs 12.3%; P<.001). There were more long-term complications (41.6% vs 19%; P.001) and more reoperations (26.7% vs 12.7%; P<.001) after GB. Comorbidities improved more after RYGBP. CONCLUSIONS: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is associated with better weight loss, resulting in a better correction of some comorbidities than GB, at the price of a higher early complication rate. This difference, however, is largely compensated by the much higher long-term complication and reoperation rates seen after GB.","*Gastric Bypass *Gastroplasty Humans Obesity, Morbid/*surgery"

DESIGN: Observational analysis of hospital discharge information. SETTING: The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database. PARTICIPANTS: Appendicitis perforation rates determined from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database of hospital discharges from 2001 to 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of the gap between perforation rates explained by various patient- and hospital-level variables. RESULTS: There were no disparities observed in adult appendicitis perforation rates. The perforation rate for white children was 26.7%; black children, 35.5%; and Latino children, 36.5%. Gap analysis showed that only 12.0% of the difference in perforation rates between black and white children was explained by insurance status and only 12.7% of the difference between Latino and white children was explained. Income level only accounted for 7.2% of the gap for black children and 6.1% for Latino children. Age explained one-third of the gap for Latino children and one-third was not accounted for by measurable variables. Two-thirds of the difference between appendicitis perforation rates between black and white children was not explained by measurable factors. CONCLUSIONS: A very small amount of the gap between minority and white children's appendicitis rates is explained by the proxy factors for health insurance and poverty status that might relate to health care access.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort-control study. SETTING: Tertiary academic referral center. PATIENTS: Thirty children with prelingual deafness underwent sequential bilateral cochlear implantation (mean age at first implant, 1.8 years; mean age at second implant, 5.3 years). Nine children with a unilateral cochlear implant were also included in the study. All children had prelingual deafness, had good implant performance, and had no benefit from a contralateral conventional hearing aid. The groups were matched on duration of unilateral implant use, chronological age, and degree of bilateral hearing loss. INTERVENTION: Sequential bilateral cochlear implantation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality of life was assessed before surgery of the second implant and after 12 and 24 months of bilateral implant use. In the children with a unilateral cochlear implant, QoL was assessed over time and was compared with the study group after 12 and 24 months. Six questionnaires were used to measure QoL: overall health status using a visual analog scale; the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3); the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL); the Glasgow Children's Benefit Inventory (GCBI); the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ); and the Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire (NCIQ). RESULTS: Results showed no significant gain in generic QoL measures associated with sequential bilateral cochlear implantation (P > .05). The nonsignificant effect yielded on the HUI3 could be attributed to the ceiling effect and the lack of resolution in the hearing domain obtained in cochlear implant recipients. The gain in QoL of +0.04 may, therefore, be underestimated. In contrast, the 3 disease-specific questionnaires showed a significant improvement in QoL (P < .05). Results also showed that, unlike the children with a unilateral implant, QoL measures continued to improve with longer durations of bilateral implant use. Within the study group, the age at second implantation had no influence on the gain in QoL (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Sequential bilateral cochlear implantation in children is associated with an improvement in QoL, although this is predominantly reflected in the disease-related aspects of QoL and not necessarily in generic QoL.","Analysis of Variance Child, Preschool *Cochlear Implants Deafness/*surgery Female Humans Infant Male Prospective Studies *Quality of Life Questionnaires Speech Perception Statistics, Nonparametric Treatment Outcome"

We compared diagnoses and treatment plans between the referring physicians and the teledermatologists. Patients with 2 or more teledermatology visits within a 1-year period were assessed for changes in clinical outcomes. SETTING: Academic medical center with an established teledermatology program since 1996. PARTICIPANTS: Medical records were evaluated for 1500 patients who underwent live interactive teledermatology consultation. Patients seen for more than 1 teledermatology visit were included in the clinical outcome assessment. INTERVENTION: Live interactive teledermatology consultation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in diagnosis, disease management, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Compared with diagnoses and treatment plans from referring physicians, the 1500 live interactive teledermatology consultations resulted in changes in diagnosis in 69.9% of patients and changes in disease management in 97.7% of patients. Among 313 patients with at least 2 teledermatology visits within 1 year, clinical improvement was observed in 68.7% of patients. Multivariate analysis showed that changes in diagnosis (P = .01), changes in disease management (P < .001), and the number of teledermatology visits (P < .001) were significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Live interactive teledermatology consultations result in changes in diagnosis and disease management in most consultations. The numbers of live interactive teledermatology visits and changes in diagnosis and disease management are significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Child Child, Preschool Dermatology/*methods Disease Management Female Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Retrospective Studies Skin Diseases/*diagnosis/*therapy Telemedicine/*methods Treatment Outcome Young Adult"
22264435,Induced abortion: incidence and trends worldwide from 1995 to 2008.,Lancet,Sedgh G and Singh S and Shah IH and Ahman E and Henshaw SK and Bankole A,guttmacher,"BACKGROUND: Data of abortion incidence and trends are needed to monitor progress toward improvement of maternal health and access to family planning. To date, estimates of safe and unsafe abortion worldwide have only been made for 1995 and 2003. METHODS: We used the standard WHO definition of unsafe abortions. Safe abortion estimates were based largely on official statistics and nationally representative surveys. Unsafe abortion estimates were based primarily on information from published studies, hospital records, and surveys of women. We used additional sources and systematic approaches to make corrections and projections as needed where data were misreported, incomplete, or from earlier years. We assessed trends in abortion incidence using rates developed for 1995, 2003, and 2008 with the same methodology. We used linear regression models to explore the association of the legal status of abortion with the abortion rate across subregions of the world in 2008. FINDINGS: The global abortion rate was stable between 2003 and 2008, with rates of 29 and 28 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 years, respectively, following a period of decline from 35 abortions per 1000 women in 1995. The average annual percent change in the rate was nearly 2.4% between 1995 and 2003 and 0.3% between 2003 and 2008. Worldwide, 49% of abortions were unsafe in 2008, compared to 44% in 1995. About one in five pregnancies ended in abortion in 2008. The abortion rate was lower in subregions where more women live under liberal abortion laws (p<0.05). INTERPRETATION: The substantial decline in the abortion rate observed earlier has stalled, and the proportion of all abortions that are unsafe has increased. Restrictive abortion laws are not associated with lower abortion rates. Measures to reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion, including investments in family planning services and safe abortion care, are crucial steps toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals.

22221952,Height and risk of heart failure in the Physicians' Health Study.,Am J Cardiol,Akinkuolie AO and Aleardi M and Ashaye AO and Gaziano JM and Djousse L,partners,"Although previous studies have reported an association between height and cardiovascular disease, it is unclear whether height is associated with the risk of heart failure (HF). We hypothesized that height would be inversely associated with HF risk. We used prospective data from 22,042 male physicians (mean age 53.8 years) from the Physicians' Health Study. Height was self-reported at baseline. Incident HF was ascertained using follow-up questionnaires and validated through review of the medical records in a subsample. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to compute the hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). The mean height +/- SD was 1.78 +/- 0.07 m. A total of 1,444 HF cases occurred during a mean follow-up of 22.3 years. Compared to subjects in the lowest height category (1.40 to 1.73 m), the HR for HF was 0.86 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.99), 0.82 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.95), and 0.76 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.91) for the height categories of 1.74 to 1.78 m, 1.79 to 1.83 m, and 1.84 to 2.08 m, respectively, after adjustment for age, weight, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (p for trend = 0.0023). The HR per SD increment in height was 0.92 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.98) in a fully adjusted model. The exclusion of those with prevalent atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hypertrophy, valvular heart disease, and a history of coronary artery bypass grafting yielded similar results (HR per SD 0.88, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94). In conclusion, our data demonstrated an inverse association between height and incident HF in United States male physicians. Additional studies to elucidate the underlying biologic mechanisms are warranted.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over *Body Height Confidence Intervals Follow-Up Studies Heart Failure/*epidemiology Humans Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular/epidemiology Incidence Male Middle Aged Odds Ratio *Physicians/statistics & numerical data Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Sampling Studies United States/epidemiology"

Warmer temperatures accelerate growth and reproduction of ectotherms, whereas these processes are slowed or halted in colder temperatures. Female blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus inhabiting the Chesapeake Bay, exhibit a seasonal migratory behavior that is closely tied with spawning and the release of larvae. To better understand reproductive activities of the migratory adult females, we examined two reproductive parameters of these crabs sampled monthly (April-December, 2006): the levels of vitellogenin (VtG) in the hemolymph and VtG expression in the hepatopancreas and ovary. The full-length cDNA of VtG (CasVtG-ova) has been isolated from the ovary. The putative CasVtG sequence found in the ovary is >99% identical to that of the hepatopancreas and is related most closely to the sequences reported in other crab species. In female C. sapidus, the hepatopancreas produces over 99% of the total VtG toward the ovarian development. Ovarian stages 2 and 3 in the sampled females are characterized by significant high levels of VtG in hemolymph and VtG expression in both the hepatopancreas and ovary. However, during the southbound migration in fall, females at ovarian stages 2 and 3 have decreased VtG levels, compared to those in spring and summer. The decreased vitellogenesis activity during the fall migration suggests seasonal adaptation to ensure successful spawning and the larval release.",Missing
22250190,The children and sunscreen study: a crossover trial investigating children's sunscreen application thickness and the influence of age and dispenser type.,Arch Dermatol,Diaz A and Neale RE and Kimlin MG and Jones L and Janda M,qut,"OBJECTIVES: To measure the thickness at which primary schoolchildren apply sunscreen on school day mornings and to compare it with the thickness (2.00 mg/cm(2)) at which sunscreen is tested during product development, as well as to investigate how application thickness was influenced by age of the child (school grades 1-7) and by dispenser type (500-mL pump, 125-mL squeeze bottle, or 50-mL roll-on). DESIGN: A crossover quasiexperimental study design comparing 3 sunscreen dispenser types. SETTING: Children aged 5 to 12 years from public primary schools (grades 1-7) in Queensland, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Children (n=87) and their parents randomly recruited from the enrollment lists of 7 primary schools. Each child provided up to 3 observations (n=258). INTERVENTION: Children applied sunscreen during 3 consecutive school weeks (Monday through Friday) for the first application of the day using a different dispenser each week. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Thickness of sunscreen application (in milligrams per square centimeter). The dispensers were weighed before and after use to calculate the weight of sunscreen applied. This was divided by the coverage area of application (in square centimeters), which was calculated by multiplying the children's body surface area by the percentage of the body covered with sunscreen. RESULTS: Children applied their sunscreen at a median thickness of 0.48 mg/cm(2). Children applied significantly more sunscreen when using the pump (0.75 mg/cm(2)) and the squeeze bottle (0.57 mg/cm(2)) compared with the roll-on (0.22 mg/cm(2)) (P<.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of age, primary schoolchildren apply sunscreen at substantially less than 1.00 mg/cm(2), similar to what has been observed among adults. Some sunscreen dispensers seem to facilitate thicker application than others.","Administration, Topical Body Surface Area Child Child, Preschool Cross-Over Studies Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Male Prognosis Queensland/epidemiology Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology/*prevention & control Sunburn/epidemiology/*prevention & control Sunscreening Agents/*administration & dosage"
22218162,Flavonoid intake and cardiovascular disease mortality in a prospective cohort of US adults.,Am J Clin Nutr,McCullough ML and Peterson JJ and Patel R and Jacques PF and Shah R and Dwyer JT,cancer,"BACKGROUND: Flavonoids are plant-based phytochemicals with cardiovascular protective properties. Few studies have comprehensively examined flavonoid classes in relation to cardiovascular disease mortality. OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between flavonoid intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among participants in a large, prospective US cohort. DESIGN: In 1999, a total of 38,180 men and 60,289 women in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort with a mean age of 70 and 69 y, respectively, completed questionnaires on medical history and lifestyle behaviors, including a 152-item food-frequency questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to calculate multivariate-adjusted hazard RRs and 95% CIs for associations between total flavonoids, 7 flavonoid classes, and CVD mortality. RESULTS: During 7 y of follow-up, 1589 CVD deaths in men and 1182 CVD deaths in women occurred. Men and women with total flavonoid intakes in the top (compared with the bottom) quintile had a lower risk of fatal CVD (RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.92; P-trend = 0.01). Five flavonoid classes-anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, flavones, flavonols, and proanthocyanidins-were individually associated with lower risk of fatal CVD (all P-trend < 0.05). In men, total flavonoid intakes were more strongly associated with stroke mortality (RR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.89; P-trend = 0.04) than with ischemic heart disease (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.13). Many associations appeared to be nonlinear, with lower risk at intakes above the referent category. CONCLUSIONS: Flavonoid consumption was associated with lower risk of death from CVD. Most inverse associations appeared with intermediate intakes, suggesting that even relatively small amounts of flavonoid-rich foods may be beneficial.",Aged Cardiovascular Diseases/*mortality *Cause of Death *Diet Diet Surveys Female Flavonoids/*therapeutic use Follow-Up Studies Health Surveys Humans Male Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Myocardial Ischemia/mortality *Phytotherapy Plant Extracts/*therapeutic use Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Questionnaires Reference Values Sex Factors Stroke/mortality United States/epidemiology

22249630,Association between obstructive sleep apnea and sudden sensorineural hearing loss: a population-based case-control study.,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Sheu JJ and Wu CS and Lin HC,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the putative association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) using a nationwide population-based data set. Obstructive sleep apnea has been associated with generalized inflammation and nervous-endocrine, cardiovascular, and other systemic biophysiologic phenomena. However, to our knowledge, no investigations have been conducted using large data sets to examine the association between OSA and auditory disorders. DESIGN: Case-control study. PARTICIPANTS: We identified 3192 patients diagnosed with SSNHL from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database as the study group and randomly extracted the data of 15,960 subjects matched by sex, age and year of first SSNHL diagnosis as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cases of OSA were identified by having been diagnosed as OSA prior to the index date of SSNHL diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression matched on age group and sex was used to assess the possible association between SSNHL and OSA among the sampled patients. RESULTS: Of 19,152 patients, 1.2% had OSA diagnoses prior to the index date; OSA was diagnosed in 1.7% of the SSNHL group and 1.2% of the controls. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and co-morbid medical disorders, we found that male patients with SSNHL were more likely to have prior OSA than controls (odds ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.02-2.16) (P = .04). No such association was found among female patients. CONCLUSIONS: Male patients with SSNHL had a higher proportion of prior OSA than non-SSNHL-diagnosed controls; no such association was found among female patients. Further study will be needed to confirm our findings, explore the underlying pathomechanisms, and investigate the difference between sexes.","Adult Aged Case-Control Studies Chi-Square Distribution Comorbidity Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural/epidemiology/*etiology Hearing Loss, Sudden/epidemiology/*etiology Humans Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Risk Factors Sex Factors Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/*complications/epidemiology Taiwan/epidemiology"

22252090,The effect of combined oral contraceptives and age on dysmenorrhoea: an epidemiological study.,Hum Reprod,Lindh I and Ellstrom AA and Milsom I,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are widely advocated as treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea, but their efficacy has been questioned in a Cochrane review. The aim of this study was to evaluate COCs and the influence of age on the severity of dysmenorrhoea. METHODS: Postal questionnaires regarding weight/height, contraception, pregnancy history and other reproductive health factors were sent to random samples of 19-year-old women born in 1962 (n = 656), 1972 (n = 780) and 1982 (n = 666) resident in the city of Gothenburg in 1981, 1991 and 2001. The responders were assessed again 5 years later at the age of 24 years. Current severity of dysmenorrhoea was measured on each occasion by a verbal multidimensional scoring system (VMS) and by a visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: The severity of dysmenorrhoea was lower (P< 0.0001) in COC users compared with non-users. In a longitudinal analysis of the severity of dysmenorrhoea, COC use and increasing age, independently of each other, were associated with the severity of dysmenorrhoea (COC use, VMS score: a reduction of 0.3 units/VAS: a reduction of 9 mm, both P< 0.0001; increasing age, VMS score: a reduction of 0.1 units per 5 years, P< 0.0001/VAS: a reduction of 5 mm per 5 years, P< 0.0001). Childbirth also reduced the severity of dysmenorrhoea (VAS, P< 0.01 with a reduction of 7 mm). Women from the 82-cohort reported a greater severity of dysmenorrhoea compared with the 62 and 72 cohorts at both 19 and 24 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: In this longitudinal case-control study, COC use and increasing age, independent of each other, reduced the severity of dysmenorrhoea. COC use reduced the severity of dysmenorrhoea more than increasing age and childbirth. There was a trend over time regarding the severity of dysmenorrhoea where women from the 82-cohort reported a greater severity of dysmenorrhoea compared with the 62 and 72 cohorts.","Adult Age Factors Case-Control Studies Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*therapeutic use Dysmenorrhea/*drug therapy Female Humans Longitudinal Studies"
22258996,Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in healthy adults and children.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Jefferson T and Jones MA and Doshi P and Del Mar CB and Heneghan CJ and Hama R and Thompson MJ,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Planning for outbreaks of influenza is a high priority public health issue for national governments. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) are thought to help reduce the symptoms of influenza with several possible mechanisms proposed. NIs have been stockpiled with a view to their widespread use in the event of a pandemic. However, the evidence base for this class of agents remains a source of debate. In a previous review we have documented substantial risks of publication bias of trials of NIs for influenza (60% of patient data from phase III treatment trials of oseltamivir have never been published) and reporting bias in the published trials. Our confidence in the conclusions of previous versions of this review has been subsequently undermined. Since we have become aware of a large number of unpublished trials of NIs in the management of influenza, this review updates and merges existing reviews in this area. OBJECTIVES: To review clinical study reports of placebo-controlled randomised trials, regulatory comments and reviews ('regulatory information') of the effects of the NIs oseltamivir and zanamivir for influenza in all age groups and appraise trial programmes, rather than single studies.Clinical study reports are very detailed, unpublished clinical trial data containing in-depth descriptions of protocol rationale, methods analysis plans, trial results and organisational documents (such as contracts). A series of clinical studies designed and conducted by one sponsor represents a trial programme of a drug indication (for example treatment of influenza). SEARCH METHODS: We searched trial registries, cross-referencing published and unpublished sources and corresponded with manufacturers and regulators. We searched the archives of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European and Japanese regulators. The evidence in this review reflects searches to obtain relevant information up to 12 April 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included regulatory information based on assessments of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in people of any age who had either confirmed or suspected influenza, or who had been exposed to influenza in the local community or place of residence. We included information which had been made available by our deadline. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We indexed regulatory information in two purpose-built instruments and reconstructed trials using CONSORT statement-based templates. To progress to Stage 2 (full analysis) we sought manufacturer explanations of discrepancies in the data. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) offered us individual patient data and responded to our queries, but Roche did not provide us with complete clinical study reports. In Stage 2 we intended to analyse trials with validated data (i.e. assuming our validation questions aimed at clarifying omissions and discrepancies were resolved). No studies progressed to Stage 2. We carried out analyses of the effects of oseltamivir on time to first alleviation of symptoms and hospitalisations using the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and tested five hypotheses generated post-protocol publication. MAIN RESULTS: We included and analysed data from 25 studies (15 oseltamivir and 10 zanamivir studies). We could not use data from a further 42 studies due to insufficient information or unresolved discrepancies in their data. The included trials were predominantly conducted in adults during influenza seasons in both hemispheres. A small number of studies were conducted in older people residing in care homes and in people with underlying respiratory diseases. The studies had adequate randomisation and blinding procedures, but imbalances in the analysis populations available (ITT influenza-infected) left many of the studies at risk of attrition bias. All the studies were sponsored by manufacturers of NIs. Time to first alleviation of symptoms in people with influenza-like illness symptoms (i.e. ITT population) was a median of 160 hours (range 125 to 192 hours) in the placebo groups and oseltamivir shortened this by around 21 hours (95% confidence interval (CI) -29.5 to -12.9 hours, P < 0.001; five studies) but there was no evidence of effect on hospitalisations based on seven studies with a median placebo group event rate of 0.84% (range 0% to 11%): odds ratio (OR) 0.95; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.61, P = 0.86). These results are based on the comprehensive ITT population data and are unlikely to be biased. A post-protocol analysis showed that participants randomised to oseltamivir in treatment trials had a reduced odds being diagnosed with influenza (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.94, P = 0.003; eight studies), probably due to an altered antibody response. Zanamivir trials showed no evidence of this. Due to limitations in the design, conduct and reporting of the trial programme, the data available to us lacked sufficient detail to credibly assess a possible effect of oseltamivir on complications and viral transmission. We postponed analysis of zanamivir evidence because of the offer of individual patient data (IPD) from its manufacturer. The authors have been unable to obtain the full set of clinical study reports or obtain verification of data from the manufacturer of oseltamivir (Roche) despite five requests between June 2010 and February 2011. No substantial comments were made by Roche on the protocol of our Cochrane Review which has been publicly available since December 2010. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found a high risk of publication and reporting biases in the trial programme of oseltamivir. Sub-population analyses of the influenza infected population in the oseltamivir trial programme are not possible because the two arms are non-comparable due to oseltamivir's apparent interference with antibody production. The evidence supports a direct oseltamivir mechanism of action on symptoms but we are unable to draw conclusions about its effect on complications or transmission. We expect full clinical study reports containing study protocol, reporting analysis plan, statistical analysis plan and individual patient data to clarify outstanding issues. These full clinical study reports are at present unavailable to us.","Adult Antiviral Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Child Drug Evaluation Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Europe Great Britain Health Status Humans Influenza, Human/*drug therapy/*prevention & control Japan Legislation, Drug Neuraminidase/*antagonists & inhibitors Oseltamivir/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Publication Bias Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic United States Zanamivir/adverse effects/*therapeutic use"

Here we used psilocybin, a classic psychedelic found in magic mushrooms, and a task-free functional MRI (fMRI) protocol designed to capture the transition from normal waking consciousness to the psychedelic state. Arterial spin labeling perfusion and blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI were used to map cerebral blood flow and changes in venous oxygenation before and after intravenous infusions of placebo and psilocybin. Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned with arterial spin labeling and a separate 15 with BOLD. As predicted, profound changes in consciousness were observed after psilocybin, but surprisingly, only decreases in cerebral blood flow and BOLD signal were seen, and these were maximal in hub regions, such as the thalamus and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC and PCC). Decreased activity in the ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was a consistent finding and the magnitude of this decrease predicted the intensity of the subjective effects. Based on these results, a seed-based pharmaco-physiological interaction/functional connectivity analysis was performed using a medial prefrontal seed. Psilocybin caused a significant decrease in the positive coupling between the mPFC and PCC. These results strongly imply that the subjective effects of psychedelic drugs are caused by decreased activity and connectivity in the brain's key connector hubs, enabling a state of unconstrained cognition.",Adult Arteries/drug effects/metabolism Brain/*drug effects/physiology Brain Mapping Cerebrovascular Circulation/drug effects Female Hallucinogens/*pharmacology Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods Male Oxygen/blood Perfusion Prefrontal Cortex/drug effects/physiology Psilocybine/*pharmacology Spin Labels

Additionally, compensatory mechanisms in children and adults with DD have been located within frontal brain areas. However, it remains unclear when and how differences in posterior left-hemispheric networks manifest and whether compensatory mechanisms have already started to develop in the prereading brain. Here we investigate functional networks during phonological processing in 36 prereading children with a familial risk for DD (n = 18, average age = 66.50 mo) compared with age and IQ-matched controls (n = 18; average age = 65.61 mo). Functional neuroimaging results reveal reduced activation in prereading children with a family-history of DD (FHD(+)), compared with those without (FHD(-)), in bilateral occipitotemporal and left temporoparietal brain regions. This finding corresponds to previously identified hypoactivations in left hemispheric posterior brain regions for school-aged children and adults with a diagnosis of DD. Furthermore, left occipitotemporal and temporoparietal brain activity correlates positively with prereading skills in both groups. Our results suggest that differences in neural correlates of phonological processing in individuals with DD are not a result of reading failure, but are present before literacy acquisition starts. Additionally, no hyperactivation in frontal brain regions was observed, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms for reading failure are not yet present. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether the identified differences may serve as neural premarkers for the early identification of children at risk for DD.",Adult Behavior/physiology Brain Mapping Cerebrum/*physiology Child Demography Dyslexia/*physiopathology Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging *Reading

DESIGN: Cross-sectional clinical study. SETTING: Berkeley, California. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer sample of 65 healthy older individuals (mean age, 76.1 years), 10 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) (mean age, 74.8 years), and 11 young controls (mean age, 24.5 years) were studied from October 31, 2005, to February 22, 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cortical [(11)C]PiB average (frontal, parietal, lateral temporal, and cingulate regions) and retrospective, self-report scales assessing participation in cognitive activities (eg, reading, writing, and playing games) and physical exercise. RESULTS: Greater participation in cognitively stimulating activities across the lifespan, but particularly in early and middle life, was associated with reduced [(11)C]PiB uptake (P<.001, accounting for age, sex, and years of education). Older participants in the highest cognitive activity tertile had [(11)C]PiB uptake comparable to young controls, whereas those in the lowest cognitive activity tertile had [(11)C]PiB uptake comparable to patients with AD. Although greater cognitive activity was associated with greater physical exercise, exercise was not associated with [(11)C]PiB uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with greater early- and middle-life cognitive activity had lower [(11)C]PiB uptake. The tendency to participate in cognitively stimulating activities is likely related to engagement in a variety of lifestyle practices that have been implicated in other studies showing reduced risk of AD-related pathology. We report a direct association between cognitive activity and [(11)C]PiB uptake, suggesting that lifestyle factors found in individuals with high cognitive engagement may prevent or slow deposition of beta-amyloid, perhaps influencing the onset and progression of AD.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Alzheimer Disease/*complications Amyloid beta-Peptides/*metabolism Aniline Compounds/diagnostic use Brain/*pathology/radionuclide imaging Brain Mapping Cognition Disorders/*etiology/*metabolism/radionuclide imaging Female Humans Linear Models Longitudinal Studies Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Neuropsychological Tests Positron-Emission Tomography Retrospective Studies Thiazoles/diagnostic use Young Adult"

However, there is very little information available concerning the effects of regular swimming exercise on vascular risks.

Before the intervention period there were no significant differences in any of the variables between groups. Body mass, adiposity, and plasma concentrations of glucose and cholesterol did not change in either group throughout the intervention period. Casual systolic BP decreased significantly from 131 +/- 3 to 122 +/- 4 mm Hg in the swimming training group. Significant decreases in systolic BP were also observed in ambulatory (daytime) and central (carotid) BP measurements. Swimming exercise produced a 21% increase in carotid artery compliance (p <0.05). Flow-mediated dilation and cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity improved after the swim training program (p <0.05). There were no significant changes in any measurements in the control group that performed gentle relaxation exercises. In conclusion, swimming exercise elicits hypotensive effects and improvements in vascular function in previously sedentary older adults.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Algorithms *Blood Pressure *Blood Pressure Determination Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory Exercise Female Humans *Hypertension/physiopathology Male Middle Aged Patient Compliance/statistics & numerical data *Swimming Texas Treatment Outcome"
22248521,Long-term impact of arsenic in drinking water on bladder cancer health care and mortality rates 20 years after end of exposure.,J Urol,Fernandez MI and Lopez JF and Vivaldi B and Coz F,Missing,"PURPOSE: In this study we assessed bladder cancer health care and mortality trends in recent decades in a well studied arsenic exposed area in Northern Chile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Arsenic levels in the affected region were obtained for the last 60 years, and correlated with bladder cancer hospital discharge and mortality rates in recent decades. RESULTS: Bladder cancer hospital discharge rates were significantly higher in the affected region (peak RR 3.6, 95% CI 3.0-4.7). Mortality rates for bladder cancer showed a trend of increase during the period analyzed, reaching peak mortality rates of 28.4 per 100,000 for men and 18.7 per 100,000 for women in the last 10 years. Poisson regression models showed an increased mortality risk in the studied region compared to the rest of the country until the present for men (IRR 5.3, 95% CI 4.8-5.8) and women (IRR 7.8, 95% CI 7.0-8.7). Mean age at cancer specific death was significantly lower in the exposed region (69.6 years, 95% CI 68.4-70.7 vs 73.7 years, 95% CI 73.3-74.2, p <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to arsenic is related to a significant need for bladder cancer health care and to high mortality rates even 20 years after having controlled arsenic levels in drinking water. Affected individuals should be aware of the significant impact of this ecological factor. Further research is required to identify strategies for the management of bladder cancer in arsenic exposed populations.",Aged Arsenic/*analysis Arsenic Poisoning/*complications/mortality Chile/epidemiology Female Humans Incidence Male Poisson Distribution Time Factors Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*chemically induced/mortality Water Supply/*analysis
22271688,Prospective study of sunburn and sun behavior patterns during adolescence.,Pediatrics,Dusza SW and Halpern AC and Satagopan JM and Oliveria SA and Weinstock MA and Scope A and Berwick M and Geller AC,mskcc,"OBJECTIVES: Early childhood UV light radiation (UVR) exposures have been shown to be associated with melanoma development later in life. The objective of this study was to assess sunburn and changes in sunburn and sun behaviors during periadolescence. METHODS: A prospective, population-based study was conducted in fifth-grade children ( approximately 10 years of age) from Framingham, Massachusetts. Surveys were administered at baseline (September-October 2004) and again 3 years later (September-October 2007). Surveys were analyzed to assess prevalence of reported sunburn and sun behaviors and to examine changes in response over the follow-up period. RESULTS: Data were analyzed from 360 participants who had complete information regarding sunburn at both time points. In 2004, approximately 53% of the students reported having at least 1 sunburn during the previous summer, and this proportion did not significantly change by 2007 (55%, P = .79), whereas liking a tan and spending time outside to get a tan significantly increased (P < .001). In 2004, 50% of students reported ""often or always"" use of sunscreen when outside for at least 6 hours in the summer; this proportion dropped to 25% at the follow-up evaluation (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: With at least 50% of children experiencing sunburns before age 11 and again 3 years later, targeting children in pediatric offices and community settings regarding unprotected UV exposure may be a practical approach. Because periadolescence is a time of volatility with regard to sun behaviors, learning more about children who receive sunburns versus those who avoid them is a critical research task.","Adolescent Child Female Follow-Up Studies *Health Behavior Health Education Health Surveys Humans Male Massachusetts Melanoma/*prevention & control Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*prevention & control Prospective Studies Skin Neoplasms/*prevention & control Sunburn/*epidemiology/*prevention & control Sunscreening Agents/administration & dosage Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects"
22271121,Association between iodinated contrast media exposure and incident hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.,Arch Intern Med,Rhee CM and Bhan I and Alexander EK and Brunelli SM,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Sudden exposure to high iodide levels may cause thyroid dysfunction. Despite compelling biological plausibility and clinical implication, the association between iodinated contrast media exposure and incident hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism has not been rigorously studied. METHODS: We performed a nested case-control study of patients treated between January 1, 1990, and June 30, 2010, who did not have preexisting hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. In parallel analyses, incident hyperthyroid or hypothyroid cases were defined by a change in thyrotropin level from normal (at baseline) to low or high (follow-up measurement). Euthyroid controls were selected using an incidence density sampling approach and were matched to cases on the basis of age, sex, race/ethnicity, estimated glomerular filtration rate, follow-up thyrotropin measurement date, and interval between baseline and the follow-up thyrotropin measurement date. Iodinated contrast media exposure was assessed using claims data for contrast-enhanced computed tomography or cardiac catheterization. RESULTS: In total, 178 and 213 incident hyperthyroid and hypothyroid cases, respectively, were matched to 655 and 779 euthyroid controls, respectively. Iodinated contrast media exposure was associated with incident hyperthyroidism (odds ratio [OR], 1.98; 95% CI, 1.08-3.60), but a statistically significant association with incident hypothyroidism was not observed (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.95-2.62). In prespecified secondary analysis, iodinated contrast media exposure was associated with incident overt hyperthyroidism (follow-up thyrotropin level </= 0.1 mIU/L; OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.06-5.93) and with incident overt hypothyroidism (follow-up thyrotropin level >10 mIU/L; OR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.07-8.72).

22274686,Serum vaccine antibody concentrations in children exposed to perfluorinated compounds.,JAMA,Grandjean P and Andersen EW and Budtz-Jorgensen E and Nielsen F and Molbak K and Weihe P and Heilmann C,harvard,"CONTEXT: Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) have emerged as important food contaminants. They cause immune suppression in a rodent model at serum concentrations similar to those occurring in the US population, but adverse health effects of PFC exposure are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether PFC exposure is associated with antibody response to childhood vaccinations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study of a birth cohort from the National Hospital in the Faroe Islands. A total of 656 consecutive singleton births were recruited during 1997-2000, [corrected] and 587 participated in follow-up through 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum antibody concentrations against tetanus and diphtheria toxoids at ages 5 and 7 years. RESULTS: Similar to results of prior studies in the United States, the PFCs with the highest serum concentrations were perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Among PFCs in maternal pregnancy serum, PFOS showed the strongest negative correlations with antibody concentrations at age 5 years, for which a 2-fold greater concentration of exposure was associated with a difference of -39% (95% CI, -55% to -17%) in the diphtheria antibody concentration. PFCs in the child's serum at age 5 years showed uniformly negative associations with antibody levels, especially at age 7 years, except that the tetanus antibody level following PFOS exposure was not statistically significant. In a structural equation model, a 2-fold greater concentration of major PFCs in child serum was associated with a difference of -49% (95% CI, -67% to -23%) in the overall antibody concentration. A 2-fold increase in PFOS and PFOA concentrations at age 5 years was associated with odds ratios between 2.38 (95% CI, 0.89 to 6.35) and 4.20 (95% CI, 1.54 to 11.44) for falling below a clinically protective level of 0.1 IU/mL for tetanus and diphtheria antibodies at age 7 years. CONCLUSION: Elevated exposures to PFCs were associated with reduced humoral immune response to routine childhood immunizations in children aged 5 and 7 years.","Antibody Formation/*drug effects Child Child, Preschool Denmark Diphtheria Toxoid/administration & dosage/*immunology Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects Female Fluorocarbons/blood/*toxicity *Food Contamination Humans Immune Tolerance Immunity, Humoral Immunization Male Maternal Exposure Milk, Human/chemistry Odds Ratio Polychlorinated Biphenyls/blood Pregnancy Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects Prospective Studies Seafood Tetanus Toxoid/administration & dosage/*immunology"

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a 26-year prospective follow-up of 852 5- to 19-year-old black and white schoolchildren (mean age, 12 years; Lipid Research Clinics, 1973-8), and parents (mean age, 40 years) from 519 families in Princeton Schools, Cincinnati, Ohio. Schoolchildren were reassessed in the Princeton Follow-up study 1999-2003 at mean age 39 years; CVD, T2DM, and HBP history of their 1038 parents were reassessed by mean age 66 years. We assessed relationships of childhood risk factors with parental CVD, T2DM, and HBP. Child-probands identified with triglyceride (TG) levels, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, body mass index (BMI), and glucose level greater than and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels less than established cutoff points. RESULTS: Pediatric HBP (P=.006) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=.018) were predictive of parental CVD at age </=50 years. Pediatric HBP (P=.02) and high TG (P=.03) were predictive of parental CVD at age </=60 years. Pediatric high TG (P=.009) and high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=.04) were predictive of parental CVD by age 66 years. Pediatric high BMI (P=.0006) were predictive of parental T2DM. Pediatric high BMI (P=.003) and black race (P=.004) were predictive of parental HBP. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric risk factors identify families with parents at increased risk for CVD, T2DM, and HBP, emphasizing the usefulness of the child as proband.","Adolescent Adult Cardiovascular Diseases/diagnosis/*epidemiology Child Child, Preschool Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/diagnosis/*epidemiology *Family Health Follow-Up Studies Humans Hypertension/diagnosis/*epidemiology Ohio *Parents Prospective Studies Risk Assessment Risk Factors Time Factors"
22271690,Hepatitis a vaccination coverage among adolescents in the United States.,Pediatrics,Dorell CG and Yankey D and Byrd KK and Murphy TV,cdc,"OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis A infection causes severe disease among adolescents and adults. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices instituted incremental recommendations for hepatitis A vaccination (HepA) at 2 years of age based on risk (1996), in selected states (1999), and universally at 1 year of age, with vaccination through 18 years of age based on risk or desire for protection (2006). We assessed adolescent HepA coverage in the United States and factors independently associated with vaccination. METHODS: Data from the 2009 National Immunization Survey-Teen (n = 20 066) were analyzed to determine >/=1- and >/=2-dose HepA coverage among adolescents 13 to 17 years of age. We used bivariate and multivariable analyses to test associations between HepA initiation and sociodemographic characteristics stratified by state groups: group 1, universal child vaccination since 1999; group 2, consideration for child vaccination since 1999; group 3, universal child vaccination at 1 year of age since 2006. RESULTS: In 2009, national 1-dose HepA coverage among adolescents was 42.0%. Seventy percent of vaccinees completed the 2-dose series. One-dose coverage was 74.3% among group 1 states, 54.0% for group 2 states, and 27.8% for group 3 states. The adjusted prevalence ratios of vaccination initiation were highest for states with a vaccination requirement and for adolescents whose providers recommended HepA. CONCLUSIONS: HepA coverage was low among most adolescents in the United States in 2009 leaving a large population susceptible to hepatitis A infection maturing into adulthood.","Adolescent Child, Preschool Female Health Surveys Hepatitis A/*prevention & control Hepatitis A Vaccines/*administration & dosage Humans Immunization Schedule Immunization, Secondary/utilization Infant Male Mass Vaccination/*utilization Patient Compliance/statistics & numerical data Poverty Areas Socioeconomic Factors United States Utilization Review/statistics & numerical data"

22269590,Impact of carotid plaque screening on smoking cessation and other cardiovascular risk factors: a randomized controlled trial.,Arch Intern Med,Rodondi N and Collet TH and Nanchen D and Locatelli I and Depairon M and Aujesky D and Bovet P and Cornuz J,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Screening of peripheral atherosclerosis is increasingly used, but few trials have examined its clinical impact. We aimed to assess whether carotid plaque screening helps smokers to improve their health behaviors and cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: We randomly assigned 536 smokers aged 40 to 70 years to carotid plaque ultrasonographic screening (US group) vs no screening (control group) in addition to individual counseling and nicotine replacement therapy for all participants. Smokers with at least 1 plaque received pictures of their plaques with a 7-minute structured explanation. The outcomes included biochemically validated smoking cessation at 12 months (primary outcome) and changes in cardiovascular risk factor levels and Framingham risk score. RESULTS: At baseline, participants (mean age, 51.1 years; 45.0% women) smoked an average of 20 cigarettes per day with a median duration of 32 years. The US group had a high prevalence of carotid plaques (57.9%). At 12 months, smoking cessation rates were high, but did not differ between the US and control groups (24.9% vs 22.1%; P = .45). In the US group, cessation rates did not differ according to the presence or absence of plaques. Control of cardiovascular risk factors (ie, blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hemoglobin A(1c) levels in diabetic patients) and mean absolute risk change in Framingham risk score did not differ between the groups. The mean absolute risk change in Framingham risk score was +0.6 in the US group vs +0.3 in the control group (P = .56). CONCLUSION: In smokers, carotid plaque screening performed in addition to thorough smoking cessation counseling is not associated with increased rates of smoking cessation or control of cardiovascular risk factors.

22271118,Effect of exercise training on depressive symptoms among patients with a chronic illness: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,Arch Intern Med,Herring MP and Puetz TW and O'Connor PJ and Dishman RK,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity and comorbid depressive symptoms are prevalent among patients with a chronic illness. To our knowledge, randomized controlled trials of the effects of exercise training on depressive symptoms among patients with a chronic illness have not been systematically reviewed. We estimated the population effect of exercise training on depressive symptoms and determined whether the effect varied according to patient characteristics and modifiable features of exercise exposure and clinical settings. METHODS: Articles published before June 1, 2011, were located using the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Scientific Database, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science. Ninety articles involving 10,534 sedentary patients with a chronic illness were selected. Included articles required (1) randomized allocation to an exercise intervention or nonexercise comparison condition and (2) a depression outcome assessed at baseline and at mid- and/or postintervention. Hedges d effect sizes were computed, study quality was evaluated, and random effects models were used to estimate sampling error and population variance of the observed effects. RESULTS: Exercise training significantly reduced depressive symptoms by a heterogeneous mean effect size delta (Delta) of 0.30 (95% CI, 0.25-0.36). Larger antidepressant effects were obtained when (1) baseline depressive symptoms were higher, (2) patients met recommended physical activity levels, and (3) the trial primary outcome, predominantly function related, was significantly improved among patients having baseline depressive symptoms indicative of mild-to-moderate depression. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise reduces depressive symptoms among patients with a chronic illness. Patients with depressive symptoms indicative of mild-to-moderate depression and for whom exercise training improves function-related outcomes achieve the largest antidepressant effects.",Chronic Disease/*psychology Depression/psychology/*therapy *Exercise Humans Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Severity of Illness Index

We hypothesized that differential preoperative expectations might contribute to this finding. In the current study we compared expectations of patients undergoing robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy vs radical retropubic prostatectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire on expectations regarding recovery was administered to 171 patients electing to undergo robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy or radical retropubic prostatectomy from 2008 to 2010. We prospectively collected data on patient expectations before surgery. Differences between patients undergoing robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy vs radical retropubic prostatectomy were assessed with adjusted proportional odds models. RESULTS: Patients who underwent robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (97) did not differ significantly from those treated with radical retropubic prostatectomy (74) in age, race, income, time between survey and surgery, and prostate specific antigen (p >/=0.4). Patients who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy had significantly higher clinical stage and Gleason grade disease (p </=0.007). After adjusting for socioeconomic factors, clinical stage and grade on multivariate analysis, patients who underwent robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy expected a significantly shorter length of stay (OR 0.07, p <0.001) and earlier return to physical activity (OR 0.36, p = 0.005).

22285033,Infant neural sensitivity to dynamic eye gaze is associated with later emerging autism.,Curr Biol,Elsabbagh M and Mercure E and Hudry K and Chandler S and Pasco G and Charman T and Pickles A and Baron-Cohen S and Bolton P and Johnson MH,Missing,"Autism spectrum disorders (henceforth autism) are diagnosed in around 1% of the population [1]. Familial liability confers risk for a broad spectrum of difficulties including the broader autism phenotype (BAP) [2, 3]. There are currently no reliable predictors of autism in infancy, but characteristic behaviors emerge during the second year, enabling diagnosis after this age [4, 5]. Because indicators of brain functioning may be sensitive predictors, and atypical eye contact is characteristic of the syndrome [6-9] and the BAP [10, 11], we examined whether neural sensitivity to eye gaze during infancy is associated with later autism outcomes [12, 13]. We undertook a prospective longitudinal study of infants with and without familial risk for autism. At 6-10 months, we recorded infants' event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to viewing faces with eye gaze directed toward versus away from the infant [14]. Longitudinal analyses showed that characteristics of ERP components evoked in response to dynamic eye gaze shifts during infancy were associated with autism diagnosed at 36 months. ERP responses to eye gaze may help characterize developmental processes that lead to later emerging autism. Findings also elucidate the mechanisms driving the development of the social brain in infancy.","Autistic Disorder/diagnosis/*physiopathology Brain/*physiopathology Child, Preschool *Evoked Potentials, Visual Female *Fixation, Ocular Humans Infant Longitudinal Studies Male Phenotype Prospective Studies Psychomotor Performance Siblings"

In our experience, mild depression benefits from medication. We reanalyzed 1 clinic's randomized placebo-controlled antidepressant studies, limiting analyses to patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) without severe illness, to determine whether nonsevere depression responds to antidepressant medication. DATA SOURCES: Archives of the Depression Evaluation Service outpatient clinic of the New York State Psychiatric Institute were searched for randomized, placebo-controlled antidepressant studies that were conducted between 1977 and 2009 and included patients having MDD and pretreatment Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores < 23. STUDY SELECTION: Six placebo-controlled studies were found, including 8 active treatment arms and 1,440 patients. 825 patients were randomized and had MDD and an HDRS score < 23. DSM-III, DSM-III-R, or DSM-IV diagnostic criteria contemporary to each study were employed. DATA EXTRACTION: Treatments were compared within study and via a patient-level meta-analysis using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of HDRS end point scores adjusted for pretreatment score. The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated from remission rates (HDRS end point score </= 7), which were compared by chi(2). Effect sizes were calculated from change in HDRS scores. Secondary analyses investigated the effect of chronicity and atypical features on treatment response. DATA SYNTHESIS: Three of 6 studies showed significant (P < .001) treatment effects by ANCOVA, and 4 of 6 studies showed significant (P < .04) differences in remission. The NNT ranged from 3 to 8. Effect sizes ranged from -0.04 to 0.8, with 4 of 8 greater than 0.4. The patient-level meta-analysis confirmed these results; neither chronicity nor atypical features significantly affected outcome. Secondary analyses utilizing global ratings and self-report mimicked the main findings. CONCLUSIONS: Several studies demonstrated significant antidepressant efficacy for patients having nonsevere MDD. Efficacy was not trivial, as NNT ranged from 3 to 8, a range accepted by researchers as sufficiently robust to recommend treatment. These findings suggest mild-moderate MDD can benefit from antidepressants, contrary to findings by several other meta- or mega-analyses.","Adult Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy Female Humans Male Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Severity of Illness Index Treatment Outcome"

OBJECTIVE: We determined whether energy-reduced diets that emphasize fat, protein, or carbohydrate differentially reduce total, visceral, or hepatic fat or preserve lean mass. DESIGN: In a subset of participants in a randomized trial of 4 weight-loss diets, body fat and lean mass (n = 424; by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and abdominal and hepatic fat (n = 165; by using computed tomography) were measured after 6 mo and 2 y. Changes from baseline were compared between assigned amounts of protein (25% compared with 15%) and fat (40% compared with 20%) and across 4 carbohydrate amounts (35% through 65%). RESULTS: At 6 mo, participants lost a mean (+/-SEM) of 4.2 +/- 0.3 kg (12.4%) fat and 2.1 +/- 0.3 kg (3.5%) lean mass (both P < 0.0001 compared with baseline values), with no differences between 25% and 15% protein (P >/= 0.10), 40% and 20% fat (P >/= 0.34), or 65% and 35% carbohydrate (P >/= 0.27).

22237058,"Cesarean section and risk of obesity in childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood: evidence from 3 Brazilian birth cohorts.",Am J Clin Nutr,Barros FC and Matijasevich A and Hallal PC and Horta BL and Barros AJ and Menezes AB and Santos IS and Gigante DP and Victora CG,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The number of cesarean sections (CSs) is increasing in many countries, and there are concerns about their short- and long-term effects. A recent Brazilian study showed a 58% higher prevalence of obesity in young adults born by CS than in young adults born vaginally. Because CS-born individuals do not make contact at birth with maternal vaginal and intestinal bacteria, the authors proposed that this could lead to long-term changes in the gut microbiota that could contribute to obesity. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether CS births lead to increased obesity during childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood in 3 birth cohorts. DESIGN: We analyzed data from 3 birth-cohort studies started in 1982, 1993, and 2004 in Southern Brazil. Subjects were assessed at different ages until 23 y of age. Poisson regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios with adjustment for </=15 socioeconomic, demographic, maternal, anthropometric, and behavioral covariates. RESULTS: In the crude analyses, subjects born by CS had approximately 50% higher prevalence of obesity at 4, 11, and 15 y of age but not at 23 y of age. After adjustment for covariates, prevalence ratios were markedly reduced and no longer significant for men or women. The only exception was an association for 4-y-old boys in the 1993 cohort, which was not observed in the other 2 cohorts or for girls. CONCLUSION: In these 3 birth cohorts, CSs do not seem to lead to an important increased risk of obesity during childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors Brazil/epidemiology Cesarean Section/*adverse effects Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Female Humans Male Obesity/epidemiology/*etiology Prevalence Regression Analysis Risk Factors Sex Factors Young Adult"
22243605,Effects of acupuncture on pregnancy rates in women undergoing in vitro fertilization: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Fertil Steril,Zheng CH and Huang GY and Zhang MM and Wang W,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of acupuncture on in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. PATIENT(S): Women undergoing IVF in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) who were evaluated for the effects of acupuncture on IVF outcomes. SETTING: Not applicable. INTERVENTION(S): The intervention groups used manual, electrical, and laser acupuncture techniques. The control groups consisted of no, sham, and placebo acupuncture. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The major outcomes were clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and live birth rate (LBR). Heterogeneity of the therapeutic effect was evaluated with a forest plot analysis. Publication bias was assessed by a funnel plot analysis. RESULT(S): Twenty-four trials (a total of 5,807 participants) were included in this review. There were no significant publication biases for most of the comparisons among these studies. The pooled CPR (23 studies) from all of the acupuncture groups was significantly greater than that from all of the control groups, whereas the LBR (6 studies) was not significantly different between the two groups. The results were different when the type of control was examined in a sensitivity analysis. The CPR and LBR differences between the acupuncture and control groups were more obvious when the studies using the Streitberger control were ignored. Similarly, if the underlying effects of the Streitberger control were excluded, the LBR results tended to be significant when the acupuncture was performed around the time of oocyte aspiration or controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. CONCLUSION(S): Acupuncture improves CPR and LBR among women undergoing IVF based on the results of studies that do not include the Streitberger control. The Streitberger control may not be an inactive control. More positive effects from using acupuncture in IVF can be expected if an appropriate control and more reasonable acupuncture programs are used.",*Acupuncture Therapy/adverse effects Female *Fertilization in Vitro/adverse effects Humans Live Birth Odds Ratio Pregnancy *Pregnancy Rate Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Treatment Outcome
22277554,Associations of processed meat and unprocessed red meat intake with incident diabetes: the Strong Heart Family Study.,Am J Clin Nutr,Fretts AM and Howard BV and McKnight B and Duncan GE and Beresford SA and Mete M and Eilat-Adar S and Zhang Y and Siscovick DS,washington,"BACKGROUND: Fifty percent of American Indians (AIs) develop diabetes by age 55 y. Whether processed meat is associated with the risk of diabetes in AIs, a rural population with a high intake of processed meat (eg, canned meats in general, referred to as ""spam"") and a high rate of diabetes, is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of usual intake of processed meat with incident diabetes in AIs. DESIGN: This prospective cohort study included AI participants from the Strong Heart Family Study who were free of diabetes and cardiovascular disease at baseline and who participated in a 5-y follow-up examination (n = 2001). Dietary intake was ascertained by using a Block food-frequency questionnaire at baseline. Incident diabetes was defined on the basis of 2003 American Diabetes Association criteria. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the associations of dietary intake with incident diabetes. RESULTS: We identified 243 incident cases of diabetes. In a comparison of upper and lower quartiles, intake of processed meat was associated with a higher risk of incident diabetes (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.21, 2.63), after adjustment for potential confounders. The relation was particularly strong for spam (OR for the comparison of upper and lower quartiles: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.30, 3.27). Intake of unprocessed red meat was not associated with incident diabetes (OR for the comparison of upper and lower quartiles: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.59, 1.37). CONCLUSION: The consumption of processed meat, such as spam, but not unprocessed red meat, was associated with higher risk of diabetes in AIs, a rural population at high risk of diabetes and with limited access to healthy foods.","Adolescent Adult Aged Diabetes Mellitus/*epidemiology/etiology Diet/*adverse effects *Energy Intake Female Follow-Up Studies Food Handling Food, Preserved/adverse effects Humans Incidence Indians, North American Interviews as Topic Male Meat/*adverse effects Meat Products/*adverse effects Middle Aged Nutrition Assessment Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Rural Population United States Young Adult"
22300691,Meta-analysis of statin effects in women versus men.,J Am Coll Cardiol,Kostis WJ and Cheng JQ and Dobrzynski JM and Cabrera J and Kostis JB,partners,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of statins in decreasing cardiovascular events in women and men. BACKGROUND: Published data reviews have suggested that statins might not be as effective in women as in men in decreasing cardiovascular events. METHODS: Published data searches and contacts with investigators identified 18 randomized clinical trials of statins with sex-specific outcomes (N = 141,235, 40,275 women, 21,468 cardiovascular events). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cardiovascular events were calculated for women and men separately with random effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: The cardiovascular event rate was lower among those randomized to statin intervention than in those randomized to control (low-dose statin in 4 studies, placebo in 11 studies, usual care in 3 studies) and similar in women and men (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.89; p < 0.0001, and OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.71 to 0.83, p < 0.0001, respectively). The benefit of statins was statistically significant in both sexes, regardless of the type of control, baseline risk, or type of endpoint and in both primary and secondary prevention. All-cause mortality was also lower with statin therapy both in women and men without significant interaction by sex (p for interaction = 0.4457). CONCLUSIONS: Statin therapy is associated with significant decreases in cardiovascular events and in all-cause mortality in women and men.

22277551,Dietary intake of PUFAs and colorectal polyp risk.,Am J Clin Nutr,Murff HJ and Shrubsole MJ and Cai Q and Smalley WE and Dai Q and Milne GL and Ness RM and Zheng W,vanderbilt,"BACKGROUND: Marine-derived n-3 (omega-3) PUFAs may reduce risk of developing colorectal cancer; however, few studies have investigated the association of n-3 PUFA intakes on colorectal polyp risk. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the associations of dietary PUFA intake on risk of colorectal adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps. DESIGN: This was a colonoscopy-based case-control study that included 3166 polyp-free control subjects, 1597 adenomatous polyp cases, and 544 hyperplastic polyp cases. Dietary PUFA intake was calculated from food-frequency questionnaires and tested for association by using unconditional logistic regression. The urinary prostaglandin E(2) metabolite, which is a biomarker of prostaglandin E(2) production, was measured in 896 participants by using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: n-6 PUFAs were not associated with adenomatous or hyperplastic polyps in either men or women. Marine-derived n-3 PUFAs were associated with reduced risk of colorectal adenomas in women only, with an adjusted OR of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.97) for the highest quintile of intake compared with the lowest quintile of intake (P-trend = 0.01). Dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid was associated with an increased risk of hyperplastic polyps in men (P-trend = 0.03), which was not seen in women. In women, but not in men, dietary intake of marine-derived n-3 PUFAs was negatively correlated with urinary prostaglandin E(2) production (r = -0.18; P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Higher intakes of marine-derived n-3 PUFAs are associated with lower risk of adenomatous polyps in women, and the association may be mediated in part through a reduction in the production of prostaglandin E(2).

22264468,Weight loss prevents urinary incontinence in women with type 2 diabetes: results from the Look AHEAD trial.,J Urol,Phelan S and Kanaya AM and Subak LL and Hogan PE and Espeland MA and Wing RR and Burgio KL and DiLillo V and Gorin AA and West DS and Brown JS,calpoly,"PURPOSE: We determined the effect of weight loss on the prevalence, incidence and resolution of weekly or more frequent urinary incontinence in overweight/obese women with type 2 diabetes after 1 year of intervention in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women in this substudy (2,739, mean +/- SD age 57.9 +/- 6.8 years, body mass index 36.5 +/- 6.1 kg/m(2)) were randomized into an intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention or a diabetes support and education control condition. RESULTS: At baseline 27% of participants reported urinary incontinence on a validated questionnaire (no significant difference by intensive lifestyle intervention vs diabetes support and education). After 1 year of intervention the intensive lifestyle intervention group in this substudy lost 7.7 +/- 7.0 vs 0.7 +/- 5.0 kg in the diabetes support and education group. At 1 year fewer women in the intensive lifestyle intervention group reported urinary incontinence (25.3% vs 28.6% in the diabetes support and education group, p = 0.05). Among participants without urinary incontinence at baseline 10.5% of intensive lifestyle intervention and 14.0% of diabetes support and education participants experienced urinary incontinence after 1 year (p = 0.02). There were no significant group differences in the resolution of urinary incontinence (p >0.17). Each kg of weight lost was associated with a 3% reduction in the odds of urinary incontinence developing (p = 0.01), and weight losses of 5% to 10% reduced these odds by 47% (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Moderate weight loss reduced the incidence but did not improve the resolution rates of urinary incontinence at 1 year among overweight/obese women with type 2 diabetes. Weight loss interventions should be considered for the prevention of urinary incontinence in overweight/obese women with diabetes.","Analysis of Variance *Chi-Square Distribution Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications/epidemiology/*prevention & control Female Humans Incidence Life Style Logistic Models Middle Aged Obesity/*complications/epidemiology/*prevention & control Prevalence Treatment Outcome United States/epidemiology Urinary Incontinence/epidemiology/*etiology/*prevention & control *Weight Loss"
22282329,Association of plasma phospholipid long-chain omega-3 fatty acids with incident atrial fibrillation in older adults: the cardiovascular health study.,Circulation,Wu JH and Lemaitre RN and King IB and Song X and Sacks FM and Rimm EB and Heckbert SR and Siscovick DS and Mozaffarian D,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Experimental studies suggest that long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) may reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF). Prior studies evaluating fish or n-3 PUFA consumption from dietary questionnaires and incident AF have been conflicting. Circulating levels of n-3 PUFAs provide an objective measurement of exposure. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 3326 US men and women >/=65 years of age and free of AF or heart failure at baseline, plasma phospholipid levels of eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid were measured at baseline by use of standardized methods. Incident AF (789 cases) was identified prospectively from hospital discharge records and study visit ECGs during 31 169 person-years of follow-up (1992-2006). In multivariable Cox models adjusted for other risk factors, the relative risk in the top versus lowest quartile of total n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic acid+docosapentaenoic acid+docosahexaenoic acid) levels was 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.89; P for trend=0.004) and of DHA levels was 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.96; P for trend=0.01). Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid levels were not significantly associated with incident AF. Evaluated nonparametrically, both total n-3 PUFAs and docosahexaenoic acid showed graded and linear inverse associations with incidence of AF. Adjustment for intervening events such as heart failure or myocardial infarction during follow-up did not appreciably alter results. CONCLUSIONS: In older adults, higher circulating total long-chain n-3 PUFA and docosahexaenoic acid levels were associated with lower risk of incident AF. These results highlight the need to evaluate whether increased dietary intake of these fatty acids could be effective for the primary prevention of AF.","Aged Atrial Fibrillation/*blood/*epidemiology/prevention & control Biological Markers/blood Dietary Fats/administration & dosage Docosahexaenoic Acids/blood Eicosapentaenoic Acid/blood Fatty Acids, Omega-3/*blood Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Male Proportional Hazards Models Risk Factors *Seafood"
22277552,Observed assertive and intrusive maternal feeding behaviors increase child adiposity.,Am J Clin Nutr,Lumeng JC and Ozbeki TN and Appugliese DP and Kaciroti N and Corwyn RF and Bradley RH,umich,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined observed maternal feeding behaviors and their potential association with child adiposity. The association between maternal prompting to eat and child adiposity has been inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to identify factors associated with maternal feeding behaviors and to test the hypothesis that more maternal prompts to eat, more assertive prompts, and more intrusiveness are associated with greater child adiposity. DESIGN: Children (n = 1218) and their mothers were videotaped eating a standardized snack at ages 15, 24, and 36 mo. Maternal prompts to eat, the percentage of prompts that were assertive, and intrusiveness were coded. Adjusted regression analyses evaluated predictors of prompts, the percentage of assertive prompts, and intrusiveness and the relation of each of these factors with child adiposity (weight-for-length z score at 15 mo and BMI z score at 24 and 36 mo) after control for the child's race-ethnicity and sex, family income-to-needs ratio, and maternal education, weight status, and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: At 36 mo, mothers gave an average of 9.3 prompts; 61% of prompts were assertive, and 48% of mothers were intrusive. Lower maternal education and minority race-ethnicity were associated with a greater percentage of assertive prompts and intrusiveness. A greater percentage of assertive prompts and intrusiveness, but not total prompts, was associated with higher child adiposity. CONCLUSIONS: Assertive prompting and an intrusive style had small but significant associations with greater child adiposity. Future work should focus on maternal motivations for assertive and intrusive feeding styles and mechanisms through which these feeding styles might increase child adiposity.","*Adiposity Assertiveness Body Mass Index Body Weight Child Behavior Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena Child, Preschool Female *Food Habits Humans Infant Linear Models Logistic Models Male *Maternal Behavior Mother-Child Relations Obesity/*psychology Questionnaires United States"
22283832,Do centenarians have higher levels of depression? Findings from the Georgia Centenarian Study.,J Am Geriatr Soc,Scheetz LT and Martin P and Poon LW,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To examine age differences on specific items and subscales of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). DESIGN: Specific items, subscales, and total score on the GDS of three age groups were compared. SETTING: Community-dwelling older adults. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred thirty-nine centenarians were compared with 93 octogenarians and 91 sexagenarians. MEASUREMENTS: GDS scores. RESULTS: Results indicated age group differences in overall depression score and in withdrawal-apathy-vigor (WAV), cognitive impairment, and hopelessness subscale scores. Significant age group differences were also obtained for 12 of the 30 items. Centenarians rated higher on all subscales, but there was no difference in dysphoric mood and worry. CONCLUSION: It is important to distinguish different dimensions of depression when assessing very old populations because some of the questions on the GDS are associated with fatigue, mild cognitive decline, and decline in physical functioning, which increase with aging. Future research should revisit the concept of depression in very late life.","Age Factors Aged, 80 and over Depression/diagnosis/*epidemiology Female Georgia Geriatric Assessment Humans Male Questionnaires"

Although chronic infections have been associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and cardiovascular disease, there is limited evidence on how infections affect risk of diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the association between serological evidence of chronic viral and bacterial infections and incident diabetes in a prospective cohort of Latino elderly. We analyzed data on 782 individuals aged >60 years and diabetes-free in 1998-1999, whose blood was tested for antibodies to herpes simplex virus 1, varicella virus, cytomegalovirus, Helicobacter pylori, and Toxoplasma gondii and who were followed until June 2008. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the relative incidence rate of diabetes by serostatus, with adjustment for age, sex, education, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and cholesterol levels. RESULTS: Individuals seropositive for herpes simplex virus 1, varicella virus, cytomegalovirus, and T. gondii did not show an increased rate of diabetes, whereas those who were seropositive for H. pylori at enrollment were 2.7 times more likely at any given time to develop diabetes than seronegative individuals (hazard ratio 2.69 [95% CI 1.10-6.60]). Controlling for insulin resistance, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 did not attenuate the effect of H. pylori infection. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated for the first time that H. pylori infection leads to an increased rate of incident diabetes in a prospective cohort study. Our findings implicate a potential role for antibiotic and gastrointestinal treatment in preventing diabetes.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies Cytomegalovirus Infections/epidemiology/physiopathology Diabetes Mellitus/*epidemiology/*etiology Female Helicobacter Infections/*epidemiology/physiopathology Helicobacter pylori/*pathogenicity Humans Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies"

DESIGN: Prospective, population-based. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Participants in the ALSWH born in 1973 to 1978 who reported on their infertility and use of in vitro fertilization (IVF) or ovulation induction (OI). INTERVENTION(S): Postal survey questionnaires administered as part of ALSWH. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Among women treated with IVF or OI and untreated women, the odds of birth outcomes estimated by use of adjusted logistic regression modeling. RESULT(S): Among 7,280 women, 18.6% (n = 1,376) reported infertility. Half (53.0%) of the treated women gave birth compared with 43.8% of untreated women. Women with prior parity were less likely to use IVF compared with nulliparous women. Women using IVF or OI, respectively, were more likely to have given birth after treatment or be pregnant compared with untreated women. Women using IVF or OI were as likely to have ectopic pregnancies, stillbirths, or premature or low birthweight babies as untreated women.

METHODS: Our cohort included all singleton births in Denmark from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2003, a total of 1,311,736 children. Cases of ASDs were obtained from the Danish National Psychiatric Register using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-8 and ICD-10. RESULTS: A total of 9556 children were diagnosed with an ASD. Both maternal and paternal age were associated with a greater risk of ASD in the offspring (hazard ratios ranging from 1.21 (1.10-1.34) to 1.65 (1.09-2.48) depending on combinations of parental age categories; <35, 35-39, and 40+ years). For mothers younger than 35 years, the risk of ASD increased with increasing father's age group. For fathers younger than 35 years, the risk of ASD increased with increasing maternal age. CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between parental age and ASD in the cohort study, but the combined underlying mechanisms through which paternal and maternal age impact ASD risk do not seem to act synergistically. The results of the sibling analysis suggest that the association between parental age and ASD found in the cohort study cannot be accounted for by common genetic and environmental factors.","Adult Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/epidemiology/*etiology Cohort Studies Denmark Female Gestational Age Humans Infant Male *Maternal Age *Paternal Age Prevalence Registries Risk Factors Sex Factors *Siblings Young Adult"

Information on smoking was collected biennially during follow-up. The authors identified a total of 2,410 participants with incident psoriasis. Compared with never smokers, past smokers had a relative risk of incident psoriasis of 1.39 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27, 1.52) and current smokers had a relative risk of 1.94 (95% CI: 1.64, 2.28). For current smokers who smoked 1-14 cigarettes/day, the relative risk was 1.81 (95% CI: 1.38, 2.36); for those who smoked 15-24 cigarettes/day, the relative risk was 2.04 (95% CI: 1.68, 2.47); and for those who smoked 25 or more cigarettes/day, the relative risk was 2.29 (95% CI: 1.74, 3.01). There was a trend toward an increased risk of psoriasis with increasing pack-years or duration of smoking (P(trend) < 0.0001).

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends not administering influenza vaccine to individuals who have had a history of GBS within 6 weeks of a prior influenza vaccination if they are not at high risk of severe complications from influenza illness. METHODS: We identified GBS cases from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California databases from 1995 into 2006 using hospital discharge codes; each medical record was neurologist-reviewed and only GBS-confirmed cases were included for follow-up. We followed confirmed cases through 2008 for vaccinations and recurrent GBS. RESULTS: We identified 550 cases of GBS over 33 million person-years. Following their GBS diagnoses, 989 vaccines were given to 279 of these individuals, including 405 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV) administered to 107 individuals with a prior diagnosis of GBS. Among the 550 total cases of GBS, 18 initially had onset within 6 weeks of TIV; of these, 2 were revaccinated with TIV without a recurrence of GBS. Only 6 individuals of 550 (1.1%) had a second (recurrent) diagnosis of GBS. Among these 6 individuals, none had any vaccine exposure at all in the 2 months prior to the second onset of GBS. CONCLUSIONS: In our population of over 3 million members, during an 11-year period, risk of GBS recurrence was low. There were no cases of recurrent GBS after influenza vaccination and none within 6 weeks after any vaccine.","Adult Aged California/epidemiology Female Follow-Up Studies Guillain-Barre Syndrome/*epidemiology/etiology Humans Incidence Influenza Vaccines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Male Middle Aged Recurrence Time Factors Vaccines/adverse effects Vaccines, Attenuated/administration & dosage/adverse effects Vaccines, Inactivated/administration & dosage/adverse effects"
22305225,Global malaria mortality between 1980 and 2010: a systematic analysis.,Lancet,Murray CJ and Rosenfeld LC and Lim SS and Andrews KG and Foreman KJ and Haring D and Fullman N and Naghavi M and Lozano R and Lopez AD,Missing,"BACKGROUND: During the past decade, renewed global and national efforts to combat malaria have led to ambitious goals. We aimed to provide an accurate assessment of the levels and time trends in malaria mortality to aid assessment of progress towards these goals and the focusing of future efforts. METHODS: We systematically collected all available data for malaria mortality for the period 1980-2010, correcting for misclassification bias. We developed a range of predictive models, including ensemble models, to estimate malaria mortality with uncertainty by age, sex, country, and year. We used key predictors of malaria mortality such as Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence, first-line antimalarial drug resistance, and vector control. We used out-of-sample predictive validity to select the final model. FINDINGS: Global malaria deaths increased from 995,000 (95% uncertainty interval 711,000-1,412,000) in 1980 to a peak of 1,817,000 (1,430,000-2,366,000) in 2004, decreasing to 1,238,000 (929,000-1,685,000) in 2010. In Africa, malaria deaths increased from 493,000 (290,000-747,000) in 1980 to 1,613,000 (1,243,000-2,145,000) in 2004, decreasing by about 30% to 1,133,000 (848,000-1,591,000) in 2010. Outside of Africa, malaria deaths have steadily decreased from 502,000 (322,000-833,000) in 1980 to 104,000 (45,000-191,000) in 2010. We estimated more deaths in individuals aged 5 years or older than has been estimated in previous studies: 435,000 (307,000-658,000) deaths in Africa and 89,000 (33,000-177,000) deaths outside of Africa in 2010. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that the malaria mortality burden is larger than previously estimated, especially in adults. There has been a rapid decrease in malaria mortality in Africa because of the scaling up of control activities supported by international donors. Donor support, however, needs to be increased if malaria elimination and eradication and broader health and development goals are to be met.

Although it is expected that green tea consumption would lower the risk of incident functional disability, this has never been investigated directly. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the association between green tea consumption and incident functional disability in elderly individuals. DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study in 13,988 Japanese individuals aged >/=65 y. Information on daily green tea consumption and other lifestyle factors was collected via questionnaire in 2006. Data on functional disability were retrieved from the public Long-term Care Insurance database, in which subjects were followed up for 3 y. We used Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to investigate the association between green tea consumption and functional disability. RESULTS: The 3-y incidence of functional disability was 9.4% (1316 cases). The multiple-adjusted HR (95% CI) of incident functional disability was 0.90 (0.77, 1.06) among respondents who consumed 1-2 cups green tea/d, 0.75 (0.64, 0.88) for those who consumed 3-4 cups/d, and 0.67 (0.57, 0.79) for those who consumed >/=5 cups/d in comparison with those who consumed <1 cup/d (P-trend < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Green tea consumption is significantly associated with a lower risk of incident functional disability, even after adjustment for possible confounding factors.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Asian Continental Ancestry Group *Beverages Body Mass Index Cognition Disorders/*epidemiology/prevention & control Energy Intake Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Japan/epidemiology Life Style Male Osteoporosis/*epidemiology/prevention & control Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Stroke/*epidemiology/prevention & control Tea/*chemistry"
22283717,Efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders in older people: a meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials.,J Am Geriatr Soc,Gould RL and Coulson MC and Howard RJ,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To review the magnitude and duration of and factors associated with effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders in older people. DESIGN: Electronic literature databases and the Cochrane Trials Registry were searched for articles. A systematic critical review, random-effects meta-analysis, and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials were conducted. SETTING: Community outpatient clinics. PARTICIPANTS: People with diagnoses of anxiety disorders. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome measures of anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included. CBT was significantly more effective than treatment as usual or being on a waiting list at reducing anxiety symptoms at 0-month follow-up, with the effect size being moderate, but when CBT was compared with an active control condition, the between-group difference in favor of CBT was not statistically significant, and the effect size was small. At 6- but not 3- or 12-month follow-up, CBT was significantly more effective at reducing anxiety symptoms than an active control condition, although the effect size was again small. Meta-regression analyses revealed only one factor (type of control group) to be significantly associated with the magnitude of effect sizes. CONCLUSION: The review confirms the effectiveness of CBT for anxiety disorders in older people but is suggestive of lower efficacy in older than working-age people. The small effect sizes in favor of CBT over an active control condition illustrate the need to investigate other treatment approaches that may be used to substitute or augment CBT to increase the effectiveness of treatment of anxiety disorders in older people.",Aged Anxiety Disorders/*therapy *Cognitive Therapy Humans Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*standards Regression Analysis
22267764,Costs of childhood asthma due to traffic-related pollution in two California communities.,Eur Respir J,Brandt SJ and Perez L and Kunzli N and Lurmann F and McConnell R,umass,"Recent research suggests the burden of childhood asthma that is attributable to air pollution has been underestimated in traditional risk assessments, and there are no estimates of these associated costs. We aimed to estimate the yearly childhood asthma-related costs attributable to air pollution for Riverside and Long Beach, CA, USA, including: 1) the indirect and direct costs of healthcare utilisation due to asthma exacerbations linked with traffic-related pollution (TRP); and 2) the costs of health care for asthma cases attributable to local TRP exposure. We calculated costs using estimates from peer-reviewed literature and the authors' analysis of surveys (Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, California Health Interview Survey, National Household Travel Survey, and Health Care Utilization Project). A lower-bound estimate of the asthma burden attributable to air pollution was US$18 million yearly. Asthma cases attributable to TRP exposure accounted for almost half of this cost. The cost of bronchitic episodes was a major proportion of both the annual cost of asthma cases attributable to TRP and of pollution-linked exacerbations. Traditional risk assessment methods underestimate both the burden of disease and cost of asthma associated with air pollution, and these costs are borne disproportionately by communities with higher than average TRP.",Air Pollution Asthma/chemically induced/*economics/*epidemiology Bronchitis/economics/epidemiology California Child Cost of Illness Environment Environmental Exposure Health Care Costs Humans Risk Assessment/methods Treatment Outcome Vehicle Emissions

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between smoking history and cognitive decline in the transition from midlife to old age. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The Whitehall II study. The first cognitive assessment was in 1997 to 1999, repeated over 2002 to 2004 and 2007 to 2009. PARTICIPANTS: Data are from 5099 men and 2137 women in the Whitehall II study, mean age 56 years (range, 44-69 years) at the first cognitive assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The cognitive test battery was composed of tests of memory, vocabulary, executive function (composed of 1 reasoning and 2 fluency tests), and a global cognitive score summarizing performance across all 5 tests. Smoking status was assessed over the entire study period. Linear mixed models were used to assess the association between smoking history and 10-year cognitive decline, expressed as z scores. RESULTS: In men, 10-year cognitive decline in all tests except vocabulary among never smokers ranged from a quarter to a third of the baseline standard deviation. Faster cognitive decline was observed among current smokers compared with never smokers in men (mean difference in 10-year decline in global cognition=-0.09 [95% CI, -0.15 to -0.03] and executive function=-0.11 [95% CI, -0.17 to -0.05]). Recent ex-smokers had greater decline in executive function (-0.08 [95% CI, -0.14 to -0.02]), while the decline in long-term ex-smokers was similar to that among never smokers. In analyses that additionally took dropout and death into account, these differences were 1.2 to 1.5 times larger. In women, cognitive decline did not vary as a function of smoking status. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with never smokers, middle-aged male smokers experienced faster cognitive decline in global cognition and executive function. In ex-smokers with at least a 10-year cessation, there were no adverse effects on cognitive decline.",Adult Aged Cognition Disorders/*etiology/physiopathology Cohort Studies Female Great Britain Humans Male Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Smoking/*adverse effects Time Factors

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of entry data from an observational,prospective 2-year study.Logistic and linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used. SETTING: Twenty-nine sites of the International Maternal Pediatrics Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group study in the United States and Puerto Rico. PARTICIPANTS: Youth aged 6 to 17 years who had HIV infection (N=319). MAIN EXPOSURES: Antiretroviral treatment and perinatal HIV infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Youth and primary caregivers were administered an extensive battery of measures that assessed psychiatric symptoms; cognitive, social,and academic functioning; and quality of life. RESULTS: Characteristics of HIV were a current CD4 percentage of 25% or greater (74% of participants), HIV RNA levels of less than 400 copies/mL (59%), and current highly active antiretroviral therapy (81%). Analyses indicated associations of past and current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention class C designation with less severe attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder inattention symptoms,older age at nadir CD4 percentage and lower CD4 percentage at study entry with more severe conduct disorder symptoms,higher RNA viral load at study entry with more severe depression symptoms, and lower CD4 percentage atstudy entry with less severe symptoms of depression. There was little evidence of an association between specific antiretroviral therapy and severity of psychiatric symptoms.A lower nadir CD4 percentage was associated with lower quality of life, worse Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Coding Recall scores, and worse social functioning. CONCLUSION: Human immunodeficiency virus illness severity markers are associated with the severity of some psychiatric symptoms and, notably, with cognitive, academic,and social functioning, all of which warrant additional study.","Adolescent Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active Child *Cognition Cross-Sectional Studies Depressive Disorder, Major/etiology Female *HIV HIV Infections/complications/drug therapy/*psychology Humans Male Mental Disorders/*etiology Prospective Studies Puerto Rico *Quality of Life Severity of Illness Index United States"
22311988,Early childhood family intervention and long-term obesity prevention among high-risk minority youth.,Pediatrics,Brotman LM and Dawson-McClure S and Huang KY and Theise R and Kamboukos D and Wang J and Petkova E and Ogedegbe G,nyumc,"OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that family intervention to promote effective parenting in early childhood affects obesity in preadolescence. METHODS: Participants were 186 minority youth at risk for behavior problems who enrolled in long-term follow-up studies after random assignment to family intervention or control condition at age 4. Follow-up Study 1 included 40 girls at familial risk for behavior problems; Follow-up Study 2 included 146 boys and girls at risk for behavior problems based on teacher ratings. Family intervention aimed to promote effective parenting and prevent behavior problems during early childhood; it did not focus on physical health. BMI and health behaviors were measured an average of 5 years after intervention in Study 1 and 3 years after intervention in Study 2. RESULTS: Youth randomized to intervention had significantly lower BMI at follow-up relative to controls (Study 1 P = .05; Study 2 P = .006). Clinical impact is evidenced by lower rates of obesity (BMI >/=95th percentile) among intervention girls and boys relative to controls (Study 2: 24% vs 54%, P = .002). There were significant intervention-control group differences on physical and sedentary activity, blood pressure, and diet. CONCLUSIONS: Two long-term follow-up studies of randomized trials show that relative to controls, youth at risk for behavior problems who received family intervention at age 4 had lower BMI and improved health behaviors as they approached adolescence. Efforts to promote effective parenting and prevent behavior problems early in life may contribute to the reduction of obesity and health disparities.","Adolescent Age Factors Blood Pressure Determination Body Mass Index Child Child Behavior/*physiology Child, Preschool Early Medical Intervention/*methods Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Intervention Studies Male *Minority Groups Obesity/*ethnology/*prevention & control/therapy Parent-Child Relations Parenting/ethnology Parents/education Primary Prevention/methods Risk Assessment Sex Factors Time Factors"
22291098,Transmission of hepatitis C virus infection through tattooing and piercing: a critical review.,Clin Infect Dis,Tohme RA and Holmberg SD,cdc,"Tattoos and piercings are increasing, especially among youths, but the risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection from these practices has not been adequately assessed and there are conflicting findings in the literature. We evaluated the risk of HCV infection from tattooing and piercing using the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Studies that specified the venue of tattooing and/or piercing showed no definitive evidence for an increased risk of HCV infection when tattoos and piercings were received in professional parlors. However, the risk of HCV infection is significant, especially among high-risk groups (adjusted odds ratio, 2.0-3.6), when tattoos are applied in prison settings or by friends. Prevention interventions are needed to avoid the transmission of hepatitis C from tattooing and piercing in prisons, homes, and other potentially nonsterile settings.

However, to date, there is still no study that has explored the relationship between ED and atopic dermatitis (AD). AIM: Using a population-based data set, this case-control study aimed to examine the association of ED with prior AD by comparing the risk of prior AD between patients with ED and matched controls in Taiwan. METHODS: This study used administrative claims data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance program. We identified 3,997 patients with newly diagnosed ED as cases and randomly selected 19,985 subjects without a history of ED as controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for previously diagnosed AD between cases and controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The prevalence and risk of having been previously diagnosed with AD between cases and controls were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 23,982 sampled subjects, 1,758 (7.3%) had been previously diagnosed with AD; it was found among 425 (10.6%) cases and among 1,333 (6.7%) controls (P<0.001). Conditional logistic regression analysis demonstrated that cases were more likely to have prior AD than controls (OR=1.60, 95% CI=1.42-1.80, P<0.001) after adjusting for monthly income, geographic location, urbanization level, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and alcohol abuse/alcohol dependence syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: There was an association between ED and prior AD. We suggest that clinicians should be more attentive to sexual complaints from patients with AD.","Adolescent Adult Aged Case-Control Studies Comorbidity Confidence Intervals Dermatitis, Atopic/*epidemiology Erectile Dysfunction/*epidemiology Humans Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Odds Ratio Prevalence Taiwan/epidemiology Young Adult"
22310504,First-time first-trimester induced abortion and risk of readmission to a psychiatric hospital in women with a history of treated mental disorder.,Arch Gen Psychiatry,Munk-Olsen T and Laursen TM and Pedersen CB and Lidegaard O and Mortensen PB,Missing,"CONTEXT: Mental health problems are associated with women's reproductive decisions and predict poor mental health outcomes after abortion and childbirth. OBJECTIVES: To study whether having a first-trimester induced abortion influenced the risk of psychiatric readmission and compare findings with readmission risk in women with mental disorders giving birth. DESIGN: Survival analyses were performed in a population-based cohort study merging data from the Danish Civil Registration System, the Danish Psychiatric Central Register, and the Danish National Hospital Register from January 1,1994, to December 31, 2007. SETTING: Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: All women born in Denmark between 1962 and 1992 with a record of 1 or more psychiatric admissions at least 9 months before a first-time first-trimester induced abortion or childbirth. Main Outcome Measure Readmission at a psychiatric hospital with any type of mental disorder from 9 months before to 12 months after a first-time first-trimester induced abortion or childbirth. RESULTS: Relative risk (RR) for readmission risk 9 to 0 months before a first-trimester induced abortion was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.73-1.23) compared with the first year after the abortion. This contrasts with a reduced risk of readmission before childbirth (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42-0.75) compared with the first year post partum. Proximity to previous psychiatric admission in particular predicted rehospitalization risks in both the abortion and the childbirth group. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of readmission is similar before and after first-time first-trimester abortion, contrasting with a marked increased in risk of readmission post partum. We speculate that recent psychiatric episodes may influence women's decisions to have an induced abortion; however, this decision does not appear to influence the illness course in women with a history of treated mental disorders.","Abortion, Induced/adverse effects/*psychology Cohort Studies Denmark/epidemiology Female Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data Humans Mental Disorders/*etiology/therapy *Patient Readmission/statistics & numerical data Pregnancy Pregnancy Trimester, First/psychology Risk Risk Factors Time Factors"
22284915,"Body mass index, playing position, race, and the cardiovascular mortality of retired professional football players.",Am J Cardiol,Baron SL and Hein MJ and Lehman E and Gersic CM,cdc,"Concern exists about cardiovascular disease (CVD) in professional football players. We examined whether playing position and size influence CVD mortality in 3,439 National Football League players with >/= 5 pension-credited playing seasons from 1959 to 1988. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) compared player mortality through 2007 to the United States population of men stratified by age, race, and calendar year. Cox proportional hazards models evaluated associations of playing-time body mass index (BMI), race, and position with CVD mortality. Overall player mortality was significantly decreased (SMR 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48 to 0.59) as was mortality from cancer (SMR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.72), and CVD (SMR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.81). CVD mortality was increased for defensive linemen (SMR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.92) but not for offensive linemen (SMR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.05). Defensive linemen's cardiomyopathy mortality was also increased (SMR 5.34, 95% CI 2.30 to 10.5). Internal analyses found that CVD mortality was increased for players of nonwhite race (hazard ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.51). After adjusting for age, race, and calendar year, CVD mortality was increased for those with a playing-time BMI >/= 30 kg/m2 (hazard ratio 2.02, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.85) and for defensive linemen compared to offensive linemen (hazard ratio 2.07, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.46). In conclusion, National Football League players from the 1959 through 1988 seasons had decreased overall mortality but those with a playing-time BMI >/= 30 kg/m2 had 2 times the risk of CVD mortality compared to other players and African-American players and defensive linemen had higher CVD mortality compared to other players even after adjusting for playing-time BMI.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over *Body Mass Index Cardiovascular Diseases/ethnology/*mortality/physiopathology *Continental Population Groups Humans Male Middle Aged Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects *Retirement Risk Factors *Soccer Survival Rate/trends United States/epidemiology Young Adult"
22276996,Continuing to wear nicotine patches after smoking lapses promotes recovery of abstinence.,Addiction,Ferguson SG and Gitchell JG and Shiffman S,Missing,"AIMS: Smokers who lapse during a cessation attempt are at particularly high risk of relapse, so interventions to help smokers recover from lapses are urgently needed. Two recent studies have suggested continuing to use nicotine patches following a lapse may be a beneficial relapse prevention strategy. However, to date no study that uses approved doses of nicotine patches under real-world conditions has tested this hypothesis. DESIGN AND SETTING: Clinical trial conducted across eight US study sites. PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Using data from 509 subjects (240 active; 269 placebo) who lapsed during weeks 3-5 of treatment in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 21-mg nicotine patches, we examined whether active nicotine patch use improved the chances of recovering abstinence (7-day point-prevalence) at weeks 6 and 10. FINDINGS: Active patch use (versus placebo) increased the likelihood of recovery from a lapse both at 6 weeks [8.3% versus 0.8%; relative risk (RR) = 11.0, P < 0.001] and at 10 weeks (9.6% versus 2.6%; RR = 3.7, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Continuing treatment to aid smoking cessation with active patches promotes recovery from lapses. Smokers should be encouraged to persist with patch treatment if they lapse to smoking.","Administration, Cutaneous Adult Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Nicotine/*administration & dosage Recurrence/prevention & control Smoking/*prevention & control Smoking Cessation/*methods *Tobacco Use Cessation Products Treatment Outcome"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were 683 patients with breast cancer from 62 oncologists in five different countries recruited to an International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG 33-03) project. Questionnaires elicited patients' pre- and postconsultation preferences for involvement in treatment decision making and whether these were met or not. Decision-related outcomes were assessed postconsultation. RESULTS: Before the consultation, most patients preferred shared or patient-directed treatment decision making. After the consultation, 43% of patients' preferences changed, and most shifted toward patient-directed decisions. The actual postconsultation decision was more likely to be made according to postconsultation rather than preconsultation preferences. Compared with patients who were less involved than they had hoped to be, patients who were as involved as they had hoped to be or were even more involved in decision making had significantly better decision-related outcomes. This was true regardless of whether preference change occurred. CONCLUSION: Many patients with early-stage breast cancer have treatment options and approach treatment decisions with a desire for decisional control, which may increase after their consultation. Patients' ultimate involvement preferences were more likely to be consistent with the way the decision was actually made, suggesting that patients need to feel concordance between their preference and the actual decision. Patients who directed decisions, even if more than they hoped for, fared better on all decision-related outcomes. These results emphasize the need for oncologists to endorse and facilitate patient participation in treatment decision making.",Breast Neoplasms/*psychology/therapy *Decision Making Female Humans Male Middle Aged *Patient Participation *Patient Preference Questionnaires Referral and Consultation

Important conceptual advances have been made in understanding concepts used to describe misunderstanding. However, a systematic, empirical evaluation of the frequency of misunderstanding incorporating recent developments is lacking. METHODS: The authors queried 95 participants in phase 1 trials to provide a more sophisticated estimate of the proportion who had therapeutic misconception (TM), defined as misunderstanding the research purpose or how research differs from individualized care, and therapeutic misestimation (TMis), defined as incorrectly estimating the chance of a research trial benefit as >20% or underestimating risk as 0%. RESULTS: Sixty-five of 95 respondents (68.4%) had TM, which was associated in a multivariate analysis with lower education and family income (P = .008 and P = .001, respectively), but TM was not associated with the vulnerability of having hardly any treatment options. Eighty-nine of 95 respondents (94%) had TMis, although only 18% reported this was a factual estimate. Although the risks of investigational agents and those exacerbated by research, such as uncertain outcomes, were mentioned (39% and 41% of respondents, respectively), risks novel to research, such as research biopsies, were rarely mentioned (3% of respondents). Although most of these respondents believed that their chance of benefit was greater and that their risk was lower than the population chance (optimists) (54.6%), a substantial minority of respondents (37.6%) were pessimists. CONCLUSIONS: TM continues to be prevalent. Estimates of personal benefit were not usually meant to report facts, it remains unknown whether respondents in the current study had TMis. Although they are not more vulnerable, phase 1 participants need improved understanding of key TM concepts, with attention to risks that are not present in standard of care.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over *Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic/ethics Comprehension Female *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Humans Informed Consent Male Middle Aged Risk Assessment *Therapeutic Misconception"

Pharmacotherapy represents the current basis of lifelong PE treatment. AIM: The goal of this study was to assess the role of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) in the treatment of patients with PE without associated erectile dysfunction (ED). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The posttreatment intravaginal ejaculatory latency time was used as the primary end point of efficacy. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed by electronically searching the MedLine database for peer-reviewed articles regarding the mechanism of action and the clinical trials of PDE5 in the management of PE. A meta-analysis of these clinical studies was performed to pool the efficacy. RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles that examined the supposed mechanisms of action and 14 articles that reported data from clinical studies were reviewed. The PDE5 may exert their influence by increasing the levels of nitric oxide both centrally (reducing sympathetic drive) and peripherally (leading to smooth-muscle dilatation of the seminal tract). These drugs may also induce peripheral analgesia to prolong the duration of the erection, increase confidence, improve the perception of ejaculatory control and overall sexual satisfaction, and decrease the postorgasmic refractory time for achieving a second erection after ejaculation. Concerning the efficacy, the meta-analysis shows an overall positive effect for the use of PDE5 as monotherapy or as components of a combination regimen in the treatment of PE. The major limitations of the published literature included poor study design, the absence of solid methodology, which was characterized by the lack of a unique PE definition, and the lack of appropriate endpoints for outcome evaluation of a placebo control arm and of Institutional Review Board approval. CONCLUSION: There is inadequate, partial basic, and clinical evidence to support the use of PDE5 for the treatment of PE.",Humans Male Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use Premature Ejaculation/*drug therapy Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use

OBJECTIVE: We tested whether holiday BW gain was reduced in participants with high baseline total energy expenditure (TEE) or whether it varied by BMI (in kg/m(2)). DESIGN: In a secondary analysis of previously published data, DeltaBW normalized over 90 d from mid-September/mid-October 1999 to mid-January/early March 2000 was analyzed by sex, age, and BMI in 443 men and women (40-69 y of age). TEE was measured by doubly labeled water. High or low energy expenditure was assessed as residual TEE after linear adjustment for age, height, and BW. RESULTS: No correlations between DeltaBW and TEE or TEE residuals were found. Sixty-five percent of men and 58% of women gained >/=0.5 kg BW, with ~50% of both groups gaining >/=1% of preholiday BW. Obese men (BMI >/=30) gained more BW than did obese women. CONCLUSIONS: A high preholiday absolute TEE or residual TEE did not protect against BW gain during the winter holiday quarter. It is not known whether higher than these typical TEE levels would protect against weight gain or if the observed gain may be attributed to increased food consumption and/or reduced physical activity during the holiday quarter.",Adult Aged Body Mass Index Energy Intake *Energy Metabolism Female Follow-Up Studies *Holidays Humans Linear Models Male Middle Aged Motor Activity Obesity/metabolism Questionnaires *Seasons Sex Factors United States *Weight Gain

This may cause cisplatin-induced gastrointestinal disorders and hinders the continuation of chemotherapy. The authors of this report conducted a prospective, randomized phase 2 trial to evaluate the effects of exogenous ghrelin during cisplatin-based chemotherapy. METHODS: Forty-two patients with esophageal cancer who were receiving cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy were assigned to either a ghrelin group (n = 21) or a placebo group (n = 21). They received either intravenous infusions of synthetic human ghrelin (3 mug/kg) or saline twice daily for 1 week with cisplatin administration. The primary endpoint was changes in oral calorie intake, and the secondary endpoints were chemotherapy-related adverse events; appetite visual analog scale (VAS) scores; changes in gastrointestinal hormones and nutritional status, including rapid turnover proteins, and quality of life (QoL) estimated with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL core questionnaire (QLQ-C30). RESULTS: Two patients were excluded from the final analysis: One patient suspended ghrelin administration because of excessive diaphoresis, and another patient in the placebo group failed to monitor the self-questionnaire. Food intake and appetite VAS scores were significantly higher in the ghrelin group than in the placebo group (18.2 +/- 5.2 kcal/kg/day vs 12.7 +/- 3.4 kcal/kg/day [P = .001] and 6.2 +/- 0.9 vs 4.1 +/- 0.9 [P < .0001], respectively). Patients in the ghrelin group had fewer adverse events during chemotherapy related to anorexia and nausea than patients in the control group. Significant deterioration was noted after chemotherapy in the placebo group in QoL scores, appetite, nausea and vomiting, and global health status. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term administration of exogenous ghrelin at the start of cisplatin-based chemotherapy stimulated food intake and minimized adverse events.","Adult Aged Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Appetite/*drug effects Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology Cisplatin/adverse effects Energy Intake/*drug effects Esophageal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology Female Ghrelin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Humans Male Middle Aged Nausea/chemically induced/prevention & control Neoadjuvant Therapy/methods Neoplasm Staging Patient Selection Prospective Studies *Quality of Life Questionnaires Treatment Outcome Vomiting/chemically induced/prevention & control"

PURPOSE: To assess the quality of return to sports after hip resurfacing arthroplasty by examining the time spent running, weekly mileage, and the possibility of returning to competition in a series of patients. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: A prospective, consecutive series of 202 patients (215 hip resurfacings) was assessed to evaluate the possible resumption of running activity (time spent, weekly mileage, return to competition). Of this initial cohort, 40 patients (43 resurfacings, 21%) practiced running preoperatively. Mean age at hip resurfacing arthroplasty was 50.7 years (range, 31-61 years). No patients underwent revision surgery. A questionnaire was administered to assess the number, type, and level of sports activities. Among patients who practiced running, we determined, preoperatively and at last follow-up, their weekly mileage and whether they were competitors. RESULTS: At last follow-up, 33 of 40 patients (36/43 hips) still practiced running (P = .74), with 91.6% of them resuming running. Mean average recovery time before running at a level assessed as good by patients was 16.4 weeks (range, 5-36 weeks). The number of patients running more than 4 hours per week increased from 18 to 23. Similarly, the time devoted to running at last follow-up remained high (mean, 3.1 hours per week) with no statistically significant difference from the preoperative period (P = .54). Moreover, patients were still engaged in competition without statistical difference between the 2 periods (P = .82). CONCLUSION: Running is possible after hip resurfacing, and runners can even return to some level of competition, but this short follow-up series of hip resurfacing in athletes should be interpreted with caution regarding implant survival.","Adult *Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip Female Follow-Up Studies France Humans Male Middle Aged Postoperative Period Prospective Studies Questionnaires Running/*physiology"

Lifestyle-related diseases are well-known risk factors for coronary artery disease and induce imbalances in autonomic nervous activity. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether pet ownership modulates cardiac autonomic nervous activity imbalance in patients with lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. A total of 191 patients (mean age 69 +/- 8 years) were interviewed about their pet ownership status and were classified into pet owner and nonowner groups. After recording a 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram for heart rate variability analysis, frequency-domain and nonlinear-domain analyses were performed to determine the high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) components, LF/HF ratio, and entropy. The heart rate variability parameters were assessed for 24 hours, during the day (8.00 A.M. to 5.00 P.M.), and during the night (0:00 A.M. to 6.00 A.M.), and compared between the 2 groups. To evaluate the potential predictive factors for cardiac autonomic imbalance, univariate and multivariate analyses of HF and LF/HF were conducted for potential confounding variables. The pet owner group exhibited significantly greater HF(24h), HF(day), HF(night), entropy(24h), entropy(day), and entropy(night) and significantly lower LF/HF(24h) and LF/HF(night) compared to the nonowner group. On multivariate analysis, pet ownership was independently and positively associated with HF(24h,) HF(day), and HF(night) and inversely associated with LF/HF(24h) and LF/HF(night). In conclusion, these results suggest that pet ownership is an independent modulator of cardiac autonomic imbalance in patients with lifestyle-related diseases.","Aged Animals Arrhythmias, Cardiac/physiopathology Autonomic Nervous System/*physiopathology Cats Diabetes Mellitus/*physiopathology Dogs Electrocardiography, Ambulatory Female Heart Rate/*physiology Humans Hyperlipidemias/*physiopathology Hypertension/*physiopathology Male Multivariate Analysis *Pets Smoking/epidemiology Stroke Volume"

METHODS: This was an ancillary study of the Supplementation With Folate, Vitamins B(6) and B(12) and/or Omega-3 Fatty Acids (SU.FOL.OM3) secondary prevention trial (2003-2009). In all, 2501 individuals aged 45 to 80 years were randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial design to one of the following 4 daily supplementation groups: (1) 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (0.56 mg), pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B(6); 3 mg) and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B(12); 0.02 mg); (2) eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid (600 mg) in a 2:1 ratio; (3) B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids; or (4) placebo. Overall and sex-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs regarding the cancer outcomes were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: After 5 years of supplementation, incident cancer was validated in 7.0% of the sample (145 events in men and 29 in women), and death from cancer occurred in 2.3% of the sample. There was no association between cancer outcomes and supplementation with B vitamins (HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.85-1.55]) and/or omega-3 fatty acids (HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.87-1.58]). There was a statistically significant interaction of treatment by sex, with no effect of treatment on cancer risk among men and increased cancer risk among women for omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (HR, 3.02 [95% CI, 1.33-6.89]).

22308241,"Cognitive and graded activity training can alleviate persistent fatigue after stroke: a randomized, controlled trial.",Stroke,Zedlitz AM and Rietveld TC and Geurts AC and Fasotti L,ru,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fatigue is a common, persistent consequence of stroke, and no evidence-based treatments are currently available to alleviate fatigue. A new treatment combining cognitive therapy (CO) with graded activity training (GRAT), called COGRAT, was developed to alleviate fatigue and fatigue-related symptoms. This study compared the effectiveness of the COGRAT intervention with a CO-only intervention after a 3-month qualification period without intervention. METHODS: This randomized, controlled, assessor-blind clinical trial was conducted in 8 rehabilitation centers. Eighty-three stroke patients (>4 months after stroke) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of CO or COGRAT after qualification. Seventy-three patients completed treatment and 68 were available at follow-up. Primary outcomes (Checklist Individual Strength-subscale Fatigue (CIS-f); self-observation list-fatigue (SOL-f)) and secondary outcomes (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Stroke-Adapted Sickness Impact Profile, SOL-pain, SOL-sleep-D, 6-minute walk test) were collected at baseline (before and after qualification period) and after treatment (immediate and 6-month follow-up). RESULTS: The qualification period showed stable outcome measures. Both treatments showed significant beneficial effects on fatigue (CIS-f: eta(p)(2)=0.48, P<0.001) and other outcomes (except pain and anxiety) with intention-to-treat analyses. Gains for the COGRAT group exceeded those in the CO group on number of individuals showing clinical improvement on the CIS-f (>/=8 points: 58% versus 24%) and on physical endurance (eta(p)(2)=0.20, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A 12-week cognitive therapy program can alleviate persistent fatigue after stroke. The best results are obtained when cognitive therapy is augmented with graded activity training.

METHODS: Serum 25(OH)-vitamin D concentrations of 743 Caucasian women in Perth, Western Australia (32 degrees S) were measured at 18 weeks pregnancy and grouped into quartiles. Offspring behavior was measured with the Child Behavior Checklist at 2, 5, 8, 10, 14, and 17 years of age (n range = 412-652). Receptive language was assessed with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised at ages 5 (n = 534) and 10 (n = 474) years. Raw scores were converted to standardized scores, incorporating cutoffs for clinically significant levels of difficulty. RESULTS: chi(2) analyses revealed no significant associations between maternal 25(OH)-vitamin D serum quartiles and offspring behavioral/emotional problems at any age. In contrast, there were significant linear trends between quartiles of maternal vitamin D levels and language impairment at 5 and 10 years of age. Multivariate regression analyses, incorporating a range of confounding variables, found that the risk of women with vitamin D insufficiency (</=46 nmol/L) during pregnancy having a child with clinically significant language difficulties was increased close to twofold compared with women with vitamin D levels >70 nmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal vitamin D insufficiency during pregnancy is significantly associated with offspring language impairment. Maternal vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the risk of developmental language difficulties among their children.","Adult Age Factors Child Child, Preschool Cognition Disorders/epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology Cohort Studies Confidence Intervals Developmental Disabilities/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology Female Gestational Age Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Language Development Language Development Disorders/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology Male Multivariate Analysis Nervous System Diseases/epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology Odds Ratio Pregnancy/*blood Prenatal Care/methods Prognosis Reference Values Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/blood Vitamin D Deficiency/*blood"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively followed a cohort of 446 unaffected carriers of an MMR gene mutation (MLH1, n = 161; MSH2, n = 222; MSH6, n = 47; and PMS2, n = 16) and 1,029 their unaffected relatives who did not carry a mutation every 5 years at recruitment centers of the Colon Cancer Family Registry. For comparison of cancer risk with the general population, we estimated country-, age-, and sex-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of cancer for carriers and noncarriers. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 5 years, mutation carriers had an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC; SIR, 20.48; 95% CI, 11.71 to 33.27; P < .001), endometrial cancer (SIR, 30.62; 95% CI, 11.24 to 66.64; P < .001), ovarian cancer (SIR, 18.81; 95% CI, 3.88 to 54.95; P < .001), renal cancer (SIR, 11.22; 95% CI, 2.31 to 32.79; P < .001), pancreatic cancer (SIR, 10.68; 95% CI, 2.68 to 47.70; P = .001), gastric cancer (SIR, 9.78; 95% CI, 1.18 to 35.30; P = .009), urinary bladder cancer (SIR, 9.51; 95% CI, 1.15 to 34.37; P = .009), and female breast cancer (SIR, 3.95; 95% CI, 1.59 to 8.13; P = .001). We found no evidence of their noncarrier relatives having an increased risk of any cancer, including CRC (SIR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.33 to 2.39; P = .97). CONCLUSION: We confirmed that carriers of an MMR gene mutation were at increased risk of a wide variety of cancers, including some cancers not previously recognized as being a result of MMR mutations, and found no evidence of an increased risk of cancer for their noncarrier relatives.","Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Australia/epidemiology Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality DNA Mismatch Repair/*genetics DNA Repair Enzymes/genetics DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics Female Follow-Up Studies *Genetic Predisposition to Disease Heterozygote Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged MutS Homolog 2 Protein/genetics Mutation/*genetics Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality Nuclear Proteins/genetics Prognosis Prospective Studies Risk Factors Survival Rate"

However, as adolescents become more autonomous and less motivated by parental influence, this strategy may be less appropriate. This study evaluated a primary care-based, multicomponent lifestyle intervention specifically tailored for overweight adolescent females. METHODS: Adolescent girls (N = 208) 12 to 17 years of age (mean +/- SD: 14.1 +/- 1.4 years), with a mean +/- SD BMI percentile of 97.09 +/- 2.27, were assigned randomly to the intervention or usual care control group. The gender and developmentally tailored intervention included a focus on adoptable healthy lifestyle behaviors and was reinforced by ongoing feedback from the teen's primary care physician. Of those randomized, 195 (94%) completed the 6-month posttreatment assessment, and 173 (83%) completed the 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome was reduction in BMI z score. RESULTS: The decrease in BMI z score over time was significantly greater for intervention participants compared with usual care participants (-0.15 in BMI z score among intervention participants compared with -0.08 among usual care participants; P = .012). The 2 groups did not differ in secondary metabolic or psychosocial outcomes. Compared with usual care, intervention participants reported less reduction in frequency of family meals and less fast-food intake.

METHODS: Electronic chart records at 2 tertiary care PEDs within a large pediatric health care system were reviewed from January 2003 through December 2010. The annual CT utilization rate, by anatomic location, was determined. Annual CT utilization rates were compared with alternative imaging trends for visits with chief complaints of head injury, seizure, and abdominal pain. Analysis was performed with linear regression. RESULTS: There was no change in overall CT utilization from 2003 to 2010 (beta 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-1.61 to 2.73]) or within anatomic subgroups. Head CT utilization for the chief complaints of seizure (beta -0.97, 95% CI [-1.44 to -0.90]) and head injury (beta -0.93, 95% CI [-1.71 to -0.73]) showed significant declines. Although there was no change in the abdominal CT utilization rate for abdominal pain, abdominal ultrasound utilization for abdominal pain significantly increased (beta 0.89, 95% CI [0.25-0.79]). CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed no overall increase in CT utilization through 2010. In areas where alternative non-radiation-based modalities were options, there were decreased CT trends and increased use of potential alternative non-radiation-based modalities. This is the first large PED cohort study to show a decrease in CT utilization in recent years in a regional pediatric referral center and may correlate with increased awareness of radiation risk in children.","Abdominal Pain/radiography Age Factors Child Cohort Studies Confidence Intervals Craniocerebral Trauma/radiography Emergencies Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data/trends Female Humans Incidence Linear Models Male Pediatrics/*trends Radiation Effects Radiation Monitoring Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*utilization"

We investigated whether machine learning and fMRI could help to: 1. differentiate healthy adolescents genetically at-risk for bipolar disorder and other Axis I psychiatric disorders from healthy adolescents at low risk of developing these disorders; 2. identify those healthy genetically at-risk adolescents who were most likely to develop future Axis I disorders. METHODS: 16 healthy offspring genetically at risk for bipolar disorder and other Axis I disorders by virtue of having a parent with bipolar disorder and 16 healthy, age- and gender-matched low-risk offspring of healthy parents with no history of psychiatric disorders (12-17 year-olds) performed two emotional face gender-labeling tasks (happy/neutral; fearful/neutral) during fMRI. We used Gaussian Process Classifiers (GPC), a machine learning approach that assigns a predictive probability of group membership to an individual person, to differentiate groups and to identify those at-risk adolescents most likely to develop future Axis I disorders. RESULTS: Using GPC, activity to neutral faces presented during the happy experiment accurately and significantly differentiated groups, achieving 75% accuracy (sensitivity = 75%, specificity = 75%). Furthermore, predictive probabilities were significantly higher for those at-risk adolescents who subsequently developed an Axis I disorder than for those at-risk adolescents remaining healthy at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: We show that a combination of two promising techniques, machine learning and neuroimaging, not only discriminates healthy low-risk from healthy adolescents genetically at-risk for Axis I disorders, but may ultimately help to predict which at-risk adolescents subsequently develop these disorders.","Adolescent Artificial Intelligence Bipolar Disorder/*diagnosis/etiology/psychology Case-Control Studies Child Child of Impaired Parents/*psychology Female Follow-Up Studies *Functional Neuroimaging Humans Longitudinal Studies *Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Mental Disorders/*diagnosis/etiology/psychology Mood Disorders/*diagnosis/etiology/psychology *Pattern Recognition, Physiological Prognosis ROC Curve Risk Factors"

The value of these biomarkers as independent predictors of ischemic stroke remains controversial. METHODS: We conducted a prospective nested case-control study among postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study to assess the relationship between fasting lipids (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], and triglycerides), lipoproteins (LDL, HDL, and very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL] particle number and size, intermediate-density lipoprotein [IDL] particle number, and lipoprotein (a)), and risk of ischemic stroke. Among women free of stroke at baseline, 774 ischemic stroke patients were matched according to age and race to control subjects, using a 1:1 ratio. RESULTS: In bivariate analysis, baseline triglycerides (P<0.001), IDL particles (P<0.01), LDL particles (P<0.01), VLDL triglyceride (P<0.001), VLDL particles (P<0.01), VLDL size (P<0.001), LDL size (P=0.03), and total/HDL cholesterol ratio (P<0.01) were significantly higher among women with incident ischemic stroke, whereas levels of HDL-C (P<0.01) and HDL size (P<0.01) were lower. No significant baseline difference for total cholesterol (P=0.15), LDL-C (P=0.47), and lipoprotein (a) (P=0.11) was observed.

Our aim was to study the influences of repeated low saturated fat dietary counseling on dietary intakes and lipoprotein measures from infancy to adulthood. METHODS: Dietary intakes (food records) and serum lipid profile were studied annually from 7 months to 19 years of age in an atherosclerosis prevention study (Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project), comprising 540 children in the intervention group and 522 children in the control group. Serum total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) were measured and used to estimate very low-density lipoprotein-TG, intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and HDL(2)-C, as well as apolipoproteins A-1 and B. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the intervention children had a lower saturated fat intake (mean daily difference [95% confidence interval] between groups: -2.1 [-2.3, -1.9] percentage of total energy intake in boys; -1.9 [-2.1, -1.7] percentage of total energy intake in girls, both P < .001) and LDL-C concentration (difference [95% confidence interval] between groups: -0.18 [-0.26, -0.10] mmol/L, P < .001 in boys; -0.10 [-0.19, -0.01] mmol/L, P = .037 in girls), whereas HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-1 did not differ between the study groups. In boys, total cholesterol and intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein-TG, apolipoprotein B, and TG concentrations were also lower in the intervention than in the control group, whereas no differences were found in girls. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated dietary counseling is effective in decreasing saturated fat intake and serum LDL-C values from infancy until 19 years of age in both genders.

Rice products are also used as ingredients in prepared foods, some of which may not be obviously rice based. Organic brown rice syrup (OBRS) is used as a sweetener in organic food products as an alternative to high-fructose corn syrup. We hypothesized that OBRS introduces As into these products. OBJECTIVE: We determined the concentration and speciation of As in commercially available brown rice syrups and in products containing OBRS, including toddler formula, cereal/energy bars, and high-energy foods used by endurance athletes. METHODS: We used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and ion chromatography coupled to ICP-MS to determine total As (Astotal) concentrations and As speciation in products purchased via the Internet or in stores in the Hanover, New Hampshire, area. DISCUSSION: We found that OBRS can contain high concentrations of Asi and dimethyl-arsenate (DMA). An ""organic"" toddler milk formula containing OBRS as the primary ingredient had Astotal concentrations up to six times the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency safe drinking water limit. Cereal bars and high-energy foods containing OBRS also had higher As concentrations than equivalent products that did not contain OBRS. Asi was the main As species in most food products tested in this study. CONCLUSIONS: There are currently no U.S. regulations applicable to As in food, but our findings suggest that the OBRS products we evaluated may introduce significant concentrations of Asi into an individual's diet. Thus, we conclude that there is an urgent need for regulatory limits on As in food.","Arsenic/*analysis Cereals/chemistry Child Child, Preschool Food Contamination/*analysis Humans Infant Oryza sativa/*chemistry *Sweetening Agents"

OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between soft drinks and combined vascular events, including stroke. DESIGN: A population-based cohort study of stroke incidence and risk factors. PARTICANTS: Participants (N= 2564, 36% men, mean age 69 +/- 10, 20% white, 23% black, 53% Hispanic) were from the Northern Manhattan Study. MAIN MEASURES: We assessed diet and regular soft drink consumption using a food frequency questionnaire at baseline, and categorized: none (<1/month, N = 1948 diet, N = 1333 regular), light (1/month-6/week, N = 453 diet, N = 995 regular), daily (>/=1/day, N = 163 diet, N = 338 regular). Over a mean follow-up of 10 years, we examined the association between soft drink consumption and 591 incident vascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular death) using Cox models. KEY RESULTS: Controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, BMI, daily calories, consumption of protein, carbohydrates, total fat, saturated fat, and sodium, those who drank diet soft drinks daily (vs. none) had an increased risk of vascular events, and this persisted after controlling further for the metabolic syndrome, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, cardiac disease, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia (HR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.06-1.94). There was no increased risk of vascular events associated with regular soft drinks or light diet soft drink consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Daily diet soft drink consumption was associated with several vascular risk factors and with an increased risk for vascular events. Further research is needed before any conclusions can be made regarding the potential health consequences of diet soft drink consumption.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Carbonated Beverages/*adverse effects Cohort Studies *Drinking Behavior Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Middle Aged New York City *Population Surveillance/methods Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Vascular Diseases/*epidemiology/*etiology"

Thirty-four states previously enacted similar laws. The authors sought to examine the impact on access to care of state laws extending eligibility of parents' insurance to young adults. METHODS: By using a difference-in-differences analysis, we examined the 2002-2004 and 2008-2009 Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System to compare 3 states enacting laws in 2005 or 2006 with 17 states that have not enacted laws on 4 outcomes: self-reported health insurance coverage, identification of a personal physician/clinician, physical exam from a physician within the past 2 years, and forgoing care in the past year due to cost. RESULTS: For each outcome there was differential improvement among states enacting laws compared with states without laws. Health insurance differentially increased 0.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], -3.8% to 4.2%), from 67.6% to 68.1% pre-post in states enacting laws and from 68.5% to 68.7% in states without. Personal physician/clinician identification differentially increased 0.9% (95% CI -3.1% to 5.0%), from 62.4% to 65.5% in states enacting laws and from 58.0% to 60.2% in states without.

22332155,Lack of head-to-head trials and fair control arms: randomized controlled trials of biologic treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.,Arch Intern Med,Estellat C and Ravaud P,Missing,"BACKGROUND: One of the key elements of comparative treatment effectiveness research is head-to-head trials. We herein describe the control arms and the treatment received by patients in recently conducted or ongoing randomized controlled trials of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: We identified all protocols recorded in ClinicalTrials.gov to October 1, 2009. We extracted trial length and funding, prior treatment, disease activity in eligible patients, and the treatment received in both trial arms. RESULTS: Among the 91 trials identified (15 DMARD-naive trials, 63 biologic-naive trials, and 13 biologic-second-line trials) involving 18, 554 patients in control arms (3059, 13 095, and 2400 patients, respectively), only 5 compared biologic DMARDs head-to-head (2 of 7 noncommercially funded trials and 3 of 84 commercially funded trials). Two-thirds (66%) of these trials are ongoing. Networks of treatment comparisons reflect a predominant use of placebo as a comparator (81 of 102 comparisons among the 91 trials). In all 15 DMARD-naive trials, all control patients received a new treatment. In 54 of the 63 biologic-naive trials, 9224 of the 13, 095 control patients received their previously ineffective treatment, 3848 for more than 6 months, despite high levels of disease activity and contrary to guidelines. In biologic-second-line trials, 851 of the 2400 control patients received treatment comparable to their previously ineffective one. CONCLUSIONS: Head-to-head trials of biologic DMARDs are still exceptions. Exposing patients in control arms who had a previous partial response or nonresponse to an inadequate treatment could lead to irreversible deterioration in condition.","Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy Biological Therapy Humans Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*methods/*standards"
22309973,Suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant treatment: reanalysis of the randomized placebo-controlled studies of fluoxetine and venlafaxine.,Arch Gen Psychiatry,Gibbons RD and Brown CH and Hur K and Davis J and Mann JJ,uchicago,"CONTEXT: The US Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning for antidepressants and suicidal thoughts and behavior in children and young adults. OBJECTIVE: To determine the short-term safety of antidepressants by standard assessments of suicidal thoughts and behavior in youth, adult, and geriatric populations and the mediating effect of changes in depressive symptoms. DATA SOURCES: All intent-to-treat person-level longitudinal data of major depressive disorder from 12 adult, 4 geriatric, and 4 youth randomized controlled trials of fluoxetine hydrochloride and 21 adult trials of venlafaxine hydrochloride. STUDY SELECTION: All sponsor-conducted randomized controlled trials of fluoxetine and venlafaxine. DATA EXTRACTION: The suicide items from the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as well as adverse event reports of suicide attempts and suicide during active treatment were analyzed in 9185 patients (fluoxetine: 2635 adults, 960 geriatric patients, 708 youths; venlafaxine: 2421 adults with immediate-release venlafaxine and 2461 adults with extended-release venlafaxine) for a total of 53 260 person-week observations. DATA SYNTHESIS: Suicidal thoughts and behavior decreased over time for adult and geriatric patients randomized to fluoxetine or venlafaxine compared with placebo, but no differences were found for youths. In adults, reduction in suicide ideation and attempts occurred through a reduction in depressive symptoms. In all age groups, severity of depression improved with medication and was significantly related to suicide ideation or behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Fluoxetine and venlafaxine decreased suicidal thoughts and behavior for adult and geriatric patients. This protective effect is mediated by decreases in depressive symptoms with treatment. For youths, no significant effects of treatment on suicidal thoughts and behavior were found, although depression responded to treatment. No evidence of increased suicide risk was observed in youths receiving active medication. To our knowledge, this is the first research synthesis of suicidal thoughts and behavior in depressed patients treated with antidepressants that examined the mediating role of depressive symptoms using complete longitudinal person-level data from a large set of published and unpublished studies.","Cyclohexanols/*adverse effects Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy Fluoxetine/*adverse effects Humans *Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*adverse effects *Suicide"

22351712,The increasing burden of mortality from viral hepatitis in the United States between 1999 and 2007.,Ann Intern Med,Ly KN and Xing J and Klevens RM and Jiles RB and Ward JW and Holmberg SD,cdc,"BACKGROUND: The increasing health burden and mortality from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the United States are underappreciated. OBJECTIVE: To examine mortality from HBV; HCV; and, for comparison, HIV. DESIGN: Analysis of U.S. multiple-cause mortality data from 1999 to 2007 from the National Center for Health Statistics. SETTING: All U.S. states and the District of Columbia. PARTICIPANTS: Approximately 22 million decedents. MEASUREMENTS: Age-adjusted mortality rates from HBV, HCV, and HIV. Logistic regression analyses of 2007 data generated 4 independent models per outcome (HCV- or HBV-related deaths) that each included 1 of 4 comorbid conditions and all sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2007, recorded deaths from HCV [corrected] increased significantly to 15,106, whereas deaths from HIV declined to 12,734 by 2007. Factors associated with HCV-related deaths included chronic liver disease, HBV co-infection, alcohol-related conditions, minority status, and HIV co-infection. Factors that increased odds of HBV-related death included chronic liver disease, HCV co-infection, Asian or Pacific Islander descent, HIV co-infection, and alcohol-related conditions. Most deaths from HBV and HCV occurred in middle-aged persons. LIMITATION: A person other than the primary physician of the decedent frequently completed the death certificate, and HCV and HBV often were not detected and thus not reported as causes of death. CONCLUSION: By 2007, HCV had superseded HIV as a cause of death in the United States, and deaths from HCV and HBV disproportionately occurred in middle-aged persons. To achieve decreases in mortality similar to those seen with HIV requires new policy initiatives to detect patients with chronic hepatitis and link them to care and treatment.

22351891,Impact of a guideline on management of children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.,Pediatrics,Newman RE and Hedican EB and Herigon JC and Williams DD and Williams AR and Newland JG,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to describe the impact a clinical practice guideline (CPG) had on antibiotic management of children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of discharged patients from a children's hospital with an ICD-9-CM code for pneumonia (480-486). Eligible patients were admitted from July 8, 2007, through July 9, 2009, 12 months before and after the CAP CPG was introduced. Three-stage least squares regression analyses were performed to examine hypothesized simultaneous relationships, including the impact of our institution\x{2019}s antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP). RESULTS: The final analysis included 1033 patients: 530 (51%) before the CPG (pre-CPG) and 503 (49%) after the CPG (post-CPG). Pre-CPG, ceftriaxone (72%) was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic, followed by ampicillin (13%). Post-CPG, the most common antibiotic was ampicillin (63%). The effect of the CPG was associated with a 34% increase in ampicillin use (P < .001). Discharge antibiotics also changed post-CPG, showing a significant increase in amoxicillin use (P < .001) and a significant decrease in cefdinir and amoxicillin/clavulanate (P < .001), with the combined effect of the CPG and ASP leading to 12% (P < 0.001) and 16% (P < .001) reduction, respectively. Overall, treatment failure was infrequent (1.5% vs 1%). CONCLUSIONS: A CPG and ASP led to the increase in use of ampicillin for children hospitalized with CAP. In addition, less broad-spectrum discharge antibiotics were used. Patient adverse outcomes were low, indicating that ampicillin is appropriate first-line therapy for otherwise healthy children admitted with uncomplicated CAP.","Age Distribution Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Community-Acquired Infections/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology Female Follow-Up Studies Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data Humans Incidence Infant International Classification of Diseases Male Pneumonia, Bacterial/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards Radiography, Thoracic Reference Values Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Sex Distribution Treatment Outcome"

DESIGN: Prospective cohort, utilizing self-reported survey data from the Millennium Cohort Study. SETTING: US military service members in all branches including active duty, reserve and National Guard. PARTICIPANTS: Population-based sample of 45,272 participants completing both baseline (July 2001-June 2003; n = 77,047) and follow-up (June 2004-January 2006; n = 55,021) questionnaires (follow-up response rate = 71.4%). MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported smokeless tobacco initiation and persistence. FINDINGS: Over the study period, 72.4% did not deploy, 13.7% deployed without combat exposures and 13.9% deployed with combat exposures, while 1.9% were smokeless tobacco initiators and 8.9% were persistent users. The odds of initiation were greater for deployers with combat exposure [odds ratio (OR), 1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.49-2.09], deployers without combat exposure (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07-1.60) and those who deployed multiple times (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.31-2.14), as well as in smoking recidivists/initiators (OR, 4.65; 95% CI, 3.82-5.66) and those reporting post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (OR, 1.54; CI, 1.15-2.07). A similar pattern for higher odds of persistent use was observed for deployment and combat exposure, but not for smoking and mental health symptoms. Military occupation was not significantly associated with initiation or persistence. CONCLUSIONS: Deployment and combat exposure in the US military are associated with increased risk of smokeless tobacco initiation and persistence while smoking and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder increase the odds for initiation. Research is needed on aspects of military service amenable to the reduction or prevention of tobacco consumption.","Adolescent Alcohol Drinking/epidemiology Depressive Disorder/epidemiology/psychology Female Humans Male Military Personnel/psychology/*statistics & numerical data Prospective Studies Smoking/epidemiology Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology/psychology Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology/psychology *Tobacco, Smokeless United States/epidemiology War Young Adult"
22351913,Prevalence of alcohol use disorders among American surgeons.,Arch Surg,Oreskovich MR and Kaups KL and Balch CM and Hanks JB and Satele D and Sloan J and Meredith C and Buhl A and Dyrbye LN and Shanafelt TD,washington,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the point prevalence of alcohol abuse and dependence among practicing surgeons. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with data gathered through a 2010 survey. SETTING: The United States of America. PARTICIPANTS: Members of the American College of Surgeons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Alcohol abuse and dependence. RESULTS: Of 25,073 surgeons sampled, 7197 (28.7%) completed the survey. Of these, 1112 (15.4%) had a score on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, version C, consistent with alcohol abuse or dependence. The point prevalence for alcohol abuse or dependence for male surgeons was 13.9% and for female surgeons was 25.6%. Surgeons reporting a major medical error in the previous 3 months were more likely to have alcohol abuse or dependence (odds ratio, 1.45; P < .001). Surgeons who were burned out (odds ratio, 1.25; P = .01) and depressed (odds ratio, 1.48; P < .001) were more likely to have alcohol abuse or dependence. The emotional exhaustion and depersonalization domains of burnout were strongly associated with alcohol abuse or dependence. Male sex, having children, and working for the Department of Veterans Affairs were associated with a lower likelihood of alcohol abuse or dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol abuse and dependence is a significant problem in US surgeons. Organizational approaches for the early identification of problematic alcohol consumption followed by intervention and treatment where indicated should be strongly supported.","Adult Aged Alcohol-Related Disorders/*epidemiology Alcoholism/epidemiology Burnout, Professional/epidemiology/psychology Cross-Sectional Studies Depersonalization/epidemiology Female General Surgery/*statistics & numerical data Humans Job Satisfaction Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Physician Impairment/psychology/*statistics & numerical data Prevalence Quality of Life Stress, Psychological/epidemiology United States/epidemiology"
22351816,Association of increased dermatologist density with lower melanoma mortality.,Arch Dermatol,Aneja S and Aneja S and Bordeaux JS,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is an association between dermatologist density and melanoma mortality. DESIGN: A regression model was developed to test the association between melanoma mortality and dermatologist density, controlling for county demographics, health care infrastructure, and socioeconomic factors. Data were collected from the Area Resource File, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and National Program for Cancer Registries. SETTING: US counties. PATIENTS: Melanoma mortality and incidence data were reported as age-adjusted mean rates per 100 000 people from January 2002, through December 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure was melanoma mortality rate per 100 000 people at the county level. RESULTS: Geographic variation exists in the distribution of dermatologists across the United States. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of 0.001 to 1 dermatologist per 100 000 people was associated with a 35.0% reduction in the melanoma mortality rate (95% CI, 13.4%-56.6%) when compared with counties with no dermatologist. The presence of 1.001 to 2 dermatologists per 100 000 people was associated with a 53.0% reduction in the melanoma mortality rate (95% CI, 30.6%-75.4%). Having more than 2 dermatologists per 100 000 people did not further lower melanoma mortality rates. CONCLUSION: Within a given county, a greater dermatologist density is associated with lower melanoma mortality rates compared with counties that lacked a dermatologist.",Adult Aged Dermatology/*manpower Female Health Services Accessibility/*statistics & numerical data Humans Incidence Male Melanoma/*mortality Multivariate Analysis Skin Neoplasms/*mortality United States/epidemiology
22351887,Nicotine replacement therapy during pregnancy and infantile colic in the offspring.,Pediatrics,Milidou I and Henriksen TB and Jensen MS and Olsen J and Sondergaard C,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and smoking during pregnancy and infantile colic in the offspring. METHODS: We used data from maternal interviews (from pregnancy and at 6 months post partum) from the Danish National Birth Cohort (1996-2002). We included 63 128 live-born singletons with complete information on nicotine exposure during pregnancy and infantile colic symptoms as recorded at 6 months of age. RESULTS: A total of 46 660 infants (73.9%) were unexposed to nicotine during pregnancy; 207 (0.3%) were exposed to NRT, 15 016 (23.8%) were exposed to smoking, and 1245 (2.0%) to both. A total of 4974 (7.9%) infants fulfilled Wessel's modified criteria for infantile colic. Prenatal nicotine exposure was associated with elevated risk for infantile colic in the offspring. Compared with the unexposed, NRT users had an adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) of 1.6 (1.0-2.5; P = .03), smokers had OR = 1.3 (1.2-1.4), and women who both smoked and used NRT had OR = 1.6 (1.3-1.9). Partners' smoking was not associated with infantile colic after adjustment for maternal smoking. CONCLUSIONS: We corroborated the association between smoking and infantile colic after adjustment for several possible confounders in a large cohort study. Moreover, we found that infants exposed to NRT prenatally had an increased risk for infantile colic of the same magnitude as those exposed to tobacco smoke. Thus, nicotine may play a role in the pathogenesis of infantile colic.","Adult Cohort Studies Colic/*chemically induced/*epidemiology/physiopathology Confidence Intervals Denmark Female Follow-Up Studies Gestational Age Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Interviews as Topic Logistic Models Maternal Exposure/adverse effects Nicotine/*adverse effects Odds Ratio Pregnancy Risk Assessment Smoking/adverse effects/*prevention & control Smoking Cessation/methods *Tobacco Use Cessation Products"

Aim of this follow-up study was to investigate the long-term effects of HT vs. standard medical treatment plus supportive therapy (SMT). METHODS: All 52 participants of our previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) were invited to complete a standardized abdominal pain diary, on which pain frequency and pain intensity were scored. Furthermore, the Children's Somatization Inventory (CSI) and a general quality of life (QOL) questionnaire were filled out. Clinical remission was defined as > 80% improvement in pain scores compared with baseline. RESULTS: All 27 HT patients and 22 out of 25 SMT patients participated in this study. Two patients of the SMT group were lost to follow-up and one refused to participate. After a mean duration of 4.8 years follow-up (3.4-6.7), HT was still highly superior to conventional therapy with 68 vs. 20% of the patients in remission after treatment (P = 0.005). Pain intensity and pain frequency scores at follow-up were 2.8 and 2.3, respectively, in the HT group compared with 7.3 and 7.1 in the SMT group (P < 0.01). Also, somatization scores were lower in the HT group (15.2 vs. 22.8; P = 0.04). No differences were found in QOL, doctors' visits, and missed days of school or work between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effects of gut-directed HT are long lasting in children with FAP or IBS with two thirds still in remission almost 5 years after treatment, making it a highly valuable therapeutic option.",Abdominal Pain/psychology/*therapy Adolescent Chi-Square Distribution Child Female Follow-Up Studies Humans *Hypnosis Irritable Bowel Syndrome/psychology/*therapy Male Pain Measurement Quality of Life Questionnaires Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Treatment Outcome

DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Greater Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred twenty-five community-dwelling men participating in the Department of Veterans Affairs Dental Longitudinal Study. MEASUREMENTS: Dental and physical examinations were conducted every 3 to 5 years. Diet was assessed using food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). Mean follow-up was 15 years (range: 2-24 years). Periodontal disease progression on each tooth was defined as alveolar bone loss (ABL) advancement of 40% or more, probing pocket depth (PPD) of 2 mm or more, or tooth loss. Good and excellent fiber sources provided 2.5 g or more of fiber per serving. Multivariate proportional hazards regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of periodontal disease progression and tooth loss in relation to fiber sources, stratified according to age younger than 65 versus 65 and older, and controlled for smoking, body mass index, calculus, baseline periodontal disease level, caries, education, exercise, carotene, thiamin and caffeine intake, and tooth brushing. RESULTS: In men aged 65 and older, each serving of good to excellent sources of total fiber was associated with lower risk of ABL progression (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.60-0.95) and tooth loss (HR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.53-0.97). Of the different food groups, only fruits that were good to excellent sources of fiber were associated with lower risk of progression of ABL (HR = 0.86 per serving, 95% CI = 0.78-0.95), PPD (HR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.91-0.99), and tooth loss (HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.78-0.99). No significant associations were seen in men younger than 65. CONCLUSION: Benefits of higher intake of high-fiber foods, especially fruits, on slowing periodontal disease progression are most evident in men aged 65 and older.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over *Aging Dental Health Surveys *Dietary Fiber Disease Progression Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged *Oral Health Periodontal Diseases/epidemiology/*prevention & control Prospective Studies Risk Factors Time Factors United States/epidemiology *United States Department of Veterans Affairs *Veterans"
22275179,Association of industry funding with the outcome and quality of randomized controlled trials of drug therapy for rheumatoid arthritis.,Arthritis Rheum,Khan NA and Lombeida JI and Singh M and Spencer HJ and Torralba KD,uams,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of industry funding with the characteristics, outcome, and reported quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of drug therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: The Medline and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched to identify original RA drug therapy RCTs published in 2002-2003 and 2006-2007. Two reviewers independently assessed each RCT for the funding source, characteristics, outcome (positive [statistically significant result favoring experimental drug for the primary outcome] or not positive), and reporting of methodologic measures whose inadequate performance may have biased the assessment of treatment effect. RCTs that were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov and completed during the study years were assessed for publication bias. RESULTS: Of the 103 eligible RCTs identified, 58 (56.3%) were funded by industry, 19 (18.4%) were funded by nonprofit sources, 6 (5.8%) had mixed funding, and funding for 20 (19.4%) was not specified. Industry-funded RCTs had significantly more study centers and subjects, while nonprofit agency-funded RCTs had longer duration and were more likely to study different treatment strategies. Outcome could be assessed for 86 (83.5%) of the 103 RCTs studied. The funding source was not associated with a higher likelihood of positive outcomes favoring the sponsored experimental drug (75.5% of industry-funded RCTs had a positive outcome, compared with 68.8% of non-industry-funded RCTs, 40% of RCTs with mixed funding, and 81.2% of RCTs for which funding was not specified). Industry-funded RCTs showed a trend toward a higher likelihood of nonpublication (P=0.093). Industry-funded RCTs were more frequently associated with double-blinding, an adequate description of participant flow, and performance of an intent-to-treat analysis. CONCLUSION: Industry funding was not associated with a higher likelihood of positive outcomes of published RCTs of drug therapy for RA, and industry-funded RCTs performed significantly better than non-industry-funded RCTs in terms of reporting the use of some key methodologic quality measures.","Antirheumatic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use Arthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy/*economics Double-Blind Method Drug Industry/*economics Humans Organizations, Nonprofit/economics Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*economics *Research Support as Topic Treatment Outcome"
22353964,Cat scratch disease during pregnancy.,Obstet Gynecol,Bilavsky E and Amit S and Avidor B and Ephros M and Giladi M,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the pregnancy outcome, including long-term follow-up of the offspring, of pregnant women with cat scratch disease. METHODS: A surveillance study performed over 19 years identified eight pregnant women with cat scratch disease. A case of cat scratch disease was defined as a patient with a history of cat contact with regional lymphadenitis, other manifestations, or a combination of these consistent with the disease and one or more confirmatory laboratory tests. The clinical and laboratory manifestations and pregnancy outcome of all women diagnosed with cat scratch disease during pregnancy are described. RESULTS: Five of the eight pregnant women had typical disease with regional lymphadenitis; two had regional lymphadenitis with arthralgia, myalgia, and erythema nodosum; and one had neuroretinitis. Delayed diagnosis was common, although all women had a history of recent cat exposure. One woman who presented with clinical cat scratch disease during the first month of pregnancy had a spontaneous abortion. Another elected to terminate the pregnancy because of concerns related to radiation associated with abdominal computed tomography scan performed as part of an evaluation for suspected malignancy. The other six women gave birth to healthy newborns without congenital anomalies. No sequelae were recorded in mothers or children during a median follow-up of 4.5 years (range 0.5-9.5 years). CONCLUSION: With the exception of one early spontaneous abortion in which causality to cat scratch disease could not be established, neither deleterious effects of cat scratch disease on newborns nor reports of long-term sequelae were found. Physicians, especially family physicians and obstetrician-gynecologists need to be more familiar with the clinical manifestations of cat scratch disease. Close monitoring of infected women during pregnancy is advisable until more data are available to determine the optimal diagnostic and therapeutic approach.","Adult Animals Cat-Scratch Disease/*diagnosis/immunology Cats Female Humans Infant, Newborn Lymphadenitis/diagnosis/immunology Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*diagnosis/immunology Pregnancy Outcome Retinitis/diagnosis/immunology"

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to show whether equol status determines the effectiveness of soy foods to lower LDL cholesterol and to raise HDL cholesterol. DESIGN: Eighty-five hypercholesterolemic men and postmenopausal women (42 men, 43 women) participated in 1 of 3 studies that represented a range of soy interventions and that followed the same general protocol at a Canadian university hospital research center. Soy foods were provided for 1 mo at doses of 30-52 g/d for the 3 studies as follows: 1) soy foods with either high-normal (73 mg/d) or low (10 mg/d) isoflavones, 2) soy foods with or without a prebiotic to enhance colonic fermentation (10 g polyfructans/d), or 3) soy foods with a low-carbohydrate diet (26% carbohydrate). Studies 1 and 2 were randomized controlled crossover trials, and study 3 was a parallel study. RESULTS: The separation of the group into equol producers (n = 30) and nonproducers (n = 55) showed similar reductions from baseline in LDL cholesterol (-9.3 +/- 2.5% and -11.1 +/- 1.6%, respectively; P = 0.834), with preservation of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I only in equol producers compared with reductions in nonproducers (HDL cholesterol: +0.9 +/- 2.7% compared with -4.3 +/- 1.1%, P = 0.006; apolipoprotein A-I: -1.0 +/- 1.1% compared with -4.7 +/- 1.0%; P = 0.011). The amount of urinary equol excreted did not relate to the changes in blood lipids. CONCLUSIONS: Soy foods reduced serum LDL cholesterol equally in both equol producers and nonproducers. However, in equol producers, ~35% of our study population, soy consumption had the added cardiovascular benefit of maintaining higher HDL-cholesterol concentrations than those seen in equol nonproducers. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00877825 (study 1), NCT00516594 (study 2), and NCT00256516 (study 3).","Aged Apolipoprotein A-I/blood Cardiovascular Diseases/prevention & control Cholesterol, HDL/*blood Cholesterol, LDL/*blood Cross-Over Studies Diet Equol/*blood Female Humans Hyperlipidemias/*blood/diet therapy/physiopathology Male Middle Aged Postmenopause Prebiotics/analysis Risk Factors *Soy Foods"

This multicentre, randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study evaluated self-reported, carbon monoxide-verified continuous abstinence from smoking from week 2 until weeks 6, 24, and 52 in 479 smokers (>/= 1 cigarette per day) who were treated with either active (n=318) or placebo (n=161) spray for 12 weeks and low-intensity counselling at three smoking cessation clinics in Denmark and Germany. Active treatment yielded significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than placebo from week 2 until week 6 (26.1% versus 16.1%; relative success rate (RR) 1.62, 95% CI 1.09-2.41), week 24 (15.7% versus 6.8%; RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.23-4.30), and week 52 (13.8% versus 5.6%; RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.24-4.94). Most adverse events were mild to moderate, and 9.1% of subjects on active spray withdrew due to adverse events, compared to 7.5% on placebo. The overall rate of treatment-related adverse events was 87.4% with active spray versus 71.4% with placebo spray. Nicotine mouth spray delivered significantly higher 6-, 24- and 52-week continuous abstinence rates than placebo.","Administration, Inhalation Adult Breath Tests Carbon Monoxide/analysis Counseling Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Middle Aged Nicotine/*administration & dosage Smoking Cessation/*methods Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/drug therapy *Tobacco Use Cessation Products Treatment Outcome"
22371573,Telomere maintenance and telomerase activity are differentially regulated in asexual and sexual worms.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Tan TC and Rahman R and Jaber-Hijazi F and Felix DA and Chen C and Louis EJ and Aboobaker A,Missing,"In most sexually reproducing animals, replication and maintenance of telomeres occurs in the germ line and during early development in embryogenesis through the use of telomerase. Somatic cells generally do not maintain telomere sequences, and these cells become senescent in adults as telomeres shorten to a critical length. Some animals reproduce clonally and must therefore require adult somatic mechanisms for maintaining their chromosome ends. Here we study the telomere biology of planarian flatworms with apparently limitless regenerative capacity fueled by a population of highly proliferative adult stem cells. We show that somatic telomere maintenance is different in asexual and sexual animals. Asexual animals maintain telomere length somatically during reproduction by fission or when regeneration is induced by amputation, whereas sexual animals only achieve telomere elongation through sexual reproduction. We demonstrate that this difference is reflected in the expression and alternate splicing of the protein subunit of the telomerase enzyme. Asexual adult planarian stem cells appear to maintain telomere length over evolutionary timescales without passage through a germ-line stage. The adaptations we observe demonstrate indefinite somatic telomerase activity in proliferating stem cells during regeneration or reproduction by fission, and establish planarians as a pertinent model for studying telomere structure, function, and maintenance.","Alternative Splicing/genetics Animals *Gene Expression Regulation Germ Cells/metabolism In Situ Hybridization Molecular Sequence Data Planarians/*enzymology/*genetics/growth & development RNA Interference RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism Regeneration/genetics Reproduction, Asexual/*genetics Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism Telomerase/*metabolism Telomere/*metabolism Telomere Homeostasis/*genetics"

We examined the effectiveness of a telephone-based counseling program rooted in motivational interviewing to improve adherence to a medication regimen for osteoporosis. METHODS: We conducted a 1-year randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants were recruited from a large pharmacy benefits program for Medicare beneficiaries. All potentially eligible individuals had been newly prescribed a medication for osteoporosis. Consenting participants were randomized to a program of telephone-based counseling (n = 1046) using a motivational interviewing framework or a control group (n = 1041) that received mailed educational materials. Medication regimen adherence was the primary outcome compared across treatment arms and was measured as the median (interquartile range) medication possession ratio, calculated as the ratio of days with filled prescriptions to total days of follow-up. RESULTS: The groups were balanced at baseline, with a mean age of 78 years; 93.8% were female. In an intention-to-treat analysis, median adherence was 49% (interquartile range, 7%-88%) in the intervention arm and 41% (2%-86%) in the control arm (P = .07, Kruskal-Wallis test).

The authors examined whether early onset of a major depressive episode (MDE) predicted a subsequent decrease in religious service attendance. Data came from 3 follow-up studies of the National Collaborative Perinatal Project birth cohort (mean age = 37 years at last follow-up; n = 2,097; 1959-2001). The generalized estimating equations method was used to calculate the impact of an early MDE diagnosis (before age 18 years) on the likelihood of change in level of religious service attendance from childhood to adulthood. Twenty-seven percent of study participants met the criteria for lifetime MDE (n = 567), of whom 31% had their first onset prior to age 18 years. Women with early MDE onset were 1.42 times more likely (95% confidence interval: 1.19, 1.70) than women with adult-onset MDE or no lifetime MDE to stop attending religious services by the time of the first adult follow-up wave. No significant associations were observed among men. These findings suggest that women are more likely to stop attending religious services after onset of depression. Selection out of religious activities could be a significant contributor to previously observed inverse correlations between religious service attendance and psychopathology during adulthood.","Adult Age of Onset Causality Depressive Disorder, Major/*psychology Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Models, Statistical Multivariate Analysis Odds Ratio Regression Analysis *Religion and Psychology Selection Bias Sex Factors"

Although their benefits for cardiovascular disease are well established, the effects of statins on depressive symptoms are unknown. METHOD: We examined the association between baseline statin use (2000-2002) and subsequent depressive symptoms in a prospective cohort study of 965 outpatients with coronary disease from 12 outpatient clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area. Depressive symptoms were assessed annually for 6 years using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) (primary outcome measure). We evaluated the cross-sectional association between statin use and risk of depressive symptoms at baseline and the longitudinal association between baseline statin use and risk of depressive symptoms during follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 965 participants, 629 (65%) used statins. At baseline, statin users had lower mean +/- SE PHQ depression scores than nonusers (4.8 +/- 0.2 vs 5.9 +/- 0.3, P < .01). Statin users were less likely than nonusers to have depression (PHQ score >/= 10) at baseline (17% vs 24%; P = .02) and during follow-up (28% vs 40%; P < .01). Among the 776 patients without depressive symptoms at baseline (PHQ < 10), statin use was associated with a 48% decreased odds of developing depression during follow-up (odds ratio [OR], 0.52; 95% CI, 0.38-0.73; P < .01). After we adjusted for potentially confounding variables, statin use remained associated with a 38% decreased odds of subsequent depression (adjusted OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41-0.95; P = .02).

22370315,Neuropsychological performance in survivors of breast cancer more than 20 years after adjuvant chemotherapy.,J Clin Oncol,Koppelmans V and Breteler MM and Boogerd W and Seynaeve C and Gundy C and Schagen SB,Missing,"PURPOSE: Adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer can have adverse effects on cognition shortly after administration. Whether chemotherapy has any long-term effects on cognition is largely unknown, yet it becomes increasingly relevant because of the widespread use of chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer and the improved survival. We investigated whether cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy for breast cancer is associated with worse cognitive performance more than 20 years after treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This case-cohort study compared the cognitive performance of patients with breast cancer who had a history of adjuvant CMF chemotherapy treatment (six cycles; average time since treatment, 21 years; n = 196) to that of a population-based sample of women never diagnosed with cancer (n = 1,509). Participants were between 50 and 80 years of age. Exclusion criteria were ever use of adjuvant endocrine therapy, secondary malignancy, recurrence, and/or metastasis. RESULTS: The women exposed to chemotherapy performed significantly worse than the reference group on cognitive tests of immediate (P = .015) and delayed verbal memory (P = .002), processing speed (P < .001), executive functioning (P = .013), and psychomotor speed (P = .001). They experienced fewer symptoms of depression (P < .001), yet had significantly more memory complaints on two of three measures that could not be explained by cognitive test performance. CONCLUSION: Survivors of breast cancer treated with adjuvant CMF chemotherapy more than 20 years ago perform worse, on average, than random population controls on neuropsychological tests. The pattern of cognitive problems is largely similar to that observed in patients shortly after cessation of chemotherapy. This study suggests that cognitive deficits following breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent CMF chemotherapy can be long lasting.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*physiopathology/*psychology Chemotherapy, Adjuvant Cognition/*drug effects Cohort Studies Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects Executive Function/*drug effects Female Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/adverse effects Humans Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Psychomotor Performance/*drug effects *Survivors/psychology/statistics & numerical data Time Factors"
22371919,Initial coronary stent implantation with medical therapy vs medical therapy alone for stable coronary artery disease: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,Arch Intern Med,Stergiopoulos K and Brown DL,sbumed,"BACKGROUND: Prior meta-analyses have yielded conflicting results regarding the outcomes of treatment of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) with initial percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) vs medical therapy. However, most of the studies in prior systematic reviews used balloon angioplasty as well as medical therapies that do not reflect current interventional or medical practices. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of all randomized clinical trials comparing initial coronary stent implantation with medical therapy to determine the effect on death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), unplanned revascularization, and persistent angina. METHODS: Prospective randomized trials were identified by searches of the MEDLINE database from 1970 to September 2011. Trials in which stents were used in less than 50% of PCI procedures were excluded. Data were extracted from each study, and summary odds ratios (ORs) were obtained using a random effects model. RESULTS: Eight trials enrolling 7229 patients were identified. Three trials enrolled stable patients after MI, whereas 5 studies enrolled patients with stable angina and/or ischemia on stress testing. Mean weighted follow-up was 4.3 years. The respective event rates for death with stent implantation and medical therapy were 8.9% and 9.1% (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.84-1.16); for nonfatal MI, 8.9% and 8.1% (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.93-1.34); for unplanned revascularization, 21.4% and 30.7% (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57-1.06); and for persistent angina, 29% and 33% (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.60-1.05). CONCLUSION: Initial stent implantation for stable CAD shows no evidence of benefit compared with initial medical therapy for prevention of death, nonfatal MI, unplanned revascularization, or angina.","Angina Pectoris/etiology *Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary/methods/statistics & numerical data Combined Modality Therapy/methods/*statistics & numerical data *Coronary Artery Disease/complications/physiopathology/therapy Disease Progression *Drug Therapy, Combination/methods/statistics & numerical data Emergency Treatment/statistics & numerical data Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mortality Myocardial Infarction/etiology Odds Ratio Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care) Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Risk Assessment Stents/statistics & numerical data"
22331818,Postoperative radiotherapy for elderly patients with stage III lung cancer.,Cancer,Wisnivesky JP and Halm EA and Bonomi M and Smith C and Mhango G and Bagiella E,mssm,"BACKGROUND: The potential role of postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) for patients who have completely resected, stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with N2 disease remains controversial. By using population-based data, the authors of this report compared the survival of a concurrent cohort of elderly patients who had N2 disease treated with and without PORT. METHODS: By using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry linked to Medicare records, 1307 patients were identified who had stage III NSCLC with N2 lymph node involvement diagnosed between 1992 and 2005. Propensity scoring methods and instrumental variable analysis were used to compare the survival of patients who did and did not receive PORT after controlling for selection bias. RESULTS: Overall, 710 patients (54%) received PORT. Propensity score analysis indicated that PORT was not associated with improved survival in patients with N2 disease (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-1.27). Analyses that were limited to patients who did or did not receive chemotherapy, who received intermediate-complexity or high-complexity radiotherapy planning, or adjusted for time trends produced similar results. The instrumental variable estimator for the absolute improvement in 1-year and 3-year survival with PORT was -0.04 (95% CI, -0.15 to 0.08) and -0.08 (95% CI, -0.24 to 0.15), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The current data suggested that PORT is not associated with improved survival for elderly patients with N2 disease. These findings have important clinical implications, because SEER data indicate that a large percentage of elderly patients currently receive PORT despite the lack of definitive evidence about its effectiveness. The potential effectiveness of PORT should be evaluated further in randomized controlled trials.","Aged Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*mortality/*radiotherapy/surgery Female Humans Lung Neoplasms/*mortality/*radiotherapy/surgery Male Pneumonectomy Postoperative Period Radiotherapy, Adjuvant Retrospective Studies SEER Program"

OBJECTIVE: We investigated prospectively the association between coffee consumption and the risk of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cancer. DESIGN: We used data from 42,659 participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Germany study. Coffee consumption was assessed by self-administered food-frequency questionnaire at baseline, and data on medically verified incident chronic diseases were collected by active and passive follow-up procedures. HRs and 95% CIs were calculated with multivariate Cox regression models and compared by competing risk analysis. RESULTS: During 8.9 y of follow-up, we observed 1432 cases of T2D, 394 of MI, 310 of stroke, and 1801 of cancer as first qualifying events. Caffeinated (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.05) or decaffeinated (HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.31) coffee consumption (>/=4 cups/d compared with <1 cup/d; 1 cup was defined as 150 mL) was not associated with the overall risk of chronic disease. A lower risk of T2D was associated with caffeinated (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.94; P-trend 0.009) and decaffeinated (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.46, 1.06; P-trend: 0.043) coffee consumption (>/=4 cups/d compared with <1 cup/d), but cardiovascular disease and cancer risk were not. The competing risk analysis showed no significant differences between the risk associations of individual diseases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using logarithmic Poisson count data joinpoint models on mortality and population data from the World Health Organization database, we estimated numbers of deaths and age-standardized rates in 2012 from all cancers and selected cancer sites for the whole European Union (EU) and its six more populated countries. RESULTS: Cancer deaths in the EU in 2012 are estimated to be 1,283,101 (717,398 men and 565,703 women) corresponding to standardized overall cancer death rates of 139/100,000 men and 85/100,000 women. The fall from 2007 was 10% in men and 7% in women. In men, declines are predicted for stomach (-20%), leukemias (-11%), lung and prostate (-10%) and colorectal (-7%) cancers, and for stomach (-23%), leukemias (-12%), uterus and colorectum (-11%) and breast (-9%) in women. Almost stable rates are expected for pancreatic cancer (+2-3%) and increases for female lung cancer (+7%). Younger women show the greatest falls in breast cancer mortality rates in the EU (-17%), and declines are expected in all individual countries, except Poland.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to systematically review the effects of chocolate, cocoa, and flavan-3-ols on major CVD risk factors. DESIGN: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of chocolate, cocoa, or flavan-3-ols. We contacted authors for additional data and conducted duplicate assessment of study inclusion, data extraction, validity, and random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: We included 42 acute or short-term chronic (</=18 wk) RCTs that comprised 1297 participants. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR: -0.67; 95% CI: -0.98, -0.36) was improved by chocolate or cocoa due to significant reductions in serum insulin. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) improved after chronic (1.34%; 95% CI: 1.00%, 1.68%) and acute (3.19%; 95% CI: 2.04%, 4.33%) intakes. Effects on HOMA-IR and FMD remained stable to sensitivity analyses. We observed reductions in diastolic blood pressure (BP; -1.60 mm Hg; 95% CI: -2.77, -0.43 mm Hg) and mean arterial pressure (-1.64 mm Hg; 95% CI: -3.27, -0.01 mm Hg) and marginally significant effects on LDL (-0.07 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.13, 0.00 mmol/L) and HDL (0.03 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.06 mmol/L) cholesterol. Chocolate or cocoa improved FMD regardless of the dose consumed, whereas doses >50 mg epicatechin/d resulted in greater effects on systolic and diastolic BP. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation, a tool to assess quality of evidence and strength of recommendations) suggested low- to moderate-quality evidence of beneficial effects, with no suggestion of negative effects. The strength of evidence was lowered due to unclear reporting for allocation concealment, dropouts, missing data on outcomes, and heterogeneity in biomarker results in some studies. CONCLUSIONS: We found consistent acute and chronic benefits of chocolate or cocoa on FMD and previously unreported promising effects on insulin and HOMA-IR.

Surgical face masks used by patients with tuberculosis (TB) are believed to reduce transmission but have not been rigorously tested. OBJECTIVES: We sought to quantify the efficacy of surgical face masks when worn by patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). METHODS: Over 3 months, 17 patients with pulmonary MDR-TB occupied an MDR-TB ward in South Africa and wore face masks on alternate days. Ward air was exhausted to two identical chambers, each housing 90 pathogen-free guinea pigs that breathed ward air either when patients wore surgical face masks (intervention group) or when patients did not wear masks (control group). Efficacy was based on differences in guinea pig infections in each chamber. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-nine of 90 control guinea pigs (76.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 68-85%) became infected, compared with 36 of 90 intervention guinea pigs (40%; 95% CI, 31-51%), representing a 56% (95% CI, 33-70.5%) decreased risk of TB transmission when patients used masks.

22371471,Breastfeeding and the use of human milk.,Pediatrics,Missing,Missing,"Breastfeeding and human milk are the normative standards for infant feeding and nutrition. Given the documented short- and long-term medical and neurodevelopmental advantages of breastfeeding, infant nutrition should be considered a public health issue and not only a lifestyle choice. The American Academy of Pediatrics reaffirms its recommendation of exclusive breastfeeding for about 6 months, followed by continued breastfeeding as complementary foods are introduced, with continuation of breastfeeding for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant. Medical contraindications to breastfeeding are rare. Infant growth should be monitored with the World Health Organization (WHO) Growth Curve Standards to avoid mislabeling infants as underweight or failing to thrive. Hospital routines to encourage and support the initiation and sustaining of exclusive breastfeeding should be based on the American Academy of Pediatrics-endorsed WHO/UNICEF ""Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding."" National strategies supported by the US Surgeon General's Call to Action, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and The Joint Commission are involved to facilitate breastfeeding practices in US hospitals and communities. Pediatricians play a critical role in their practices and communities as advocates of breastfeeding and thus should be knowledgeable about the health risks of not breastfeeding, the economic benefits to society of breastfeeding, and the techniques for managing and supporting the breastfeeding dyad. The ""Business Case for Breastfeeding"" details how mothers can maintain lactation in the workplace and the benefits to employers who facilitate this practice.","Breast Feeding/*statistics & numerical data Child, Preschool Female Humans Infant Infant Nutrition Disorders/prevention & control Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena *Infant Welfare Infant, Newborn Male *Milk, Human Nutritional Requirements Pediatrics/standards Policy Making *Practice Guidelines as Topic Societies, Medical United Nations United States World Health Organization"
22084967,Would vaccination against nicotine be a cost-effective way to prevent smoking uptake in adolescents?,Addiction,Gartner CE and Barendregt JJ and Wallace A and Hall WD,uq,"AIMS: We used epidemiological modelling to assess whether nicotine vaccines would be a cost-effective way of preventing smoking uptake in adolescents. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: We built an epidemiological model using Australian data on age-specific smoking prevalence; smoking cessation and relapse rates; life-time sex-specific disability-adjusted life years lived for cohorts of 100,000 smokers and non-smokers; government data on the costs of delivering a vaccination programme by general practitioners; and a range of plausible and optimistic estimates of vaccine cost, efficacy and immune response rates based on clinical trial results. We first estimated the smoking uptake rates for Australians aged 12-19 years. We then used these estimates to predict the expected smoking prevalence in a birth cohort aged 12 in 2003 by age 20 under (i) current policy and (ii) different vaccination scenarios that varied in cost, initial vaccination uptake, yearly re-vaccination rates, efficacy and a favourable vaccine immune response rate. FINDINGS: Under the most optimistic assumptions, the cost to avert a smoker at age 20 was $44,431 [95% confidence interval (CI) $40,023-49,250]. This increased to $296,019 (95% CI $252,307-$355,930) under more plausible scenarios. The vaccine programme was not cost-effective under any scenario. CONCLUSIONS: A preventive nicotine vaccination programme is unlikely to be cost-effective. The total cost of a universal vaccination programme would be high and its impact on population smoking prevalence negligible. For these reasons, such a programme is unlikely to be publicly funded in Australia or any other developed country.",Adolescent Australia/epidemiology Cohort Studies Cost-Benefit Analysis Female Humans Male Prevalence Quality-Adjusted Life Years Smoking/economics/epidemiology/*prevention & control Tobacco Use Disorder/*prevention & control Vaccination/*economics Young Adult

METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial at a secondary care neonatal unit in the Netherlands on 71 preterm neonates (postmenstrual age at birth 32-37 weeks), undergoing heel lance with an automated piercing device. Newborns were randomly assigned to breast milk (either breastfed or bottle-fed) administered during heel lance or oral sucrose administered before heel lance. We assessed the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) score (range, 0-21) to investigate whether there was a difference in pain score between neonates receiving breast milk and those receiving sucrose solution. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in mean PIPP score between neonates receiving breast milk (6.1) and those receiving sucrose (5.5), with a mean difference of 0.6 (95% confidence interval -1.6 to 2.8; P = .58). CONCLUSIONS: From this study, it cannot be concluded that breast milk has a better analgesic effect than sucrose in late preterm infants. From the results, it follows with 95% confidence that the analgesic effect of breast milk is not >1.6 points better and not > 2.8 points worse on the PIPP scale (SD 3.7) than the analgesic effect of sucrose in late preterm infants.","Administration, Oral Adult Analgesia/*methods Blood Specimen Collection/*adverse effects *Breast Feeding Female Follow-Up Studies Gestational Age Humans Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature Infant, Premature, Diseases Male *Milk, Human Netherlands Pain/diagnosis/*etiology Pain Management/methods Pain Measurement Retrospective Studies Severity of Illness Index Sucrose/*administration & dosage Sweetening Agents/*administration & dosage Treatment Outcome"

DESIGN Prospective, longitudinal cohort. SETTING Emergency departments at 2 children's hospitals. PARTICIPANTS Eight- to 15-year-old children with mild TBI (n = 186) or orthopedic injuries (n = 99). MAIN EXPOSURE Closed-head or orthopedic trauma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Parents rated preinjury symptoms retrospectively shortly after injury and postconcussive symptoms at 2 weeks and 3 and 12 months postinjury. A regression-based approach was used to determine whether each child displayed reliable increases in postconcussive symptoms at each postinjury occasion. Health-related quality of life was assessed at 3 and 12 months postinjury. Information regarding children's educational programming was collected at the initial and 12-month assessments. RESULTS Children with mild TBI were significantly more likely than those with orthopedic injuries to show reliable increases in both cognitive and somatic symptoms. Group differences in the likelihood of reliable increases became less common with time for somatic symptoms but persisted to 12 months postinjury for cognitive symptoms. Among children with mild TBI, reliable increases in symptoms were more common among children with loss of consciousness or abnormalities on neuroimaging. Reliable increases in symptoms were associated with significant declines in health-related quality of life and an increased likelihood of educational intervention. CONCLUSION Many children with mild TBI show reliable increases in postconcussive symptoms that are associated with significant functional impairment in their daily lives.",Missing
22392181,Sleep-disordered breathing in a population-based cohort: behavioral outcomes at 4 and 7 years.,Pediatrics,Bonuck K and Freeman K and Chervin RD and Xu L,yu,"OBJECTIVES: Examine statistical effects of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) symptom trajectories from 6 months to 7 years on subsequent behavior. METHODS: Parents in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children reported on children's snoring, mouth breathing, and witnessed apnea at >/=2 surveys at 6, 18, 30, 42, 57, and 69 months, and completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at 4 (n = 9140) and 7 (n = 8098) years. Cluster analysis produced 5 ""Early"" (6-42 months) and ""Later"" (6-69 months) symptom trajectories (""clusters""). Adverse behavioral outcomes were defined by top 10th percentiles on Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire total and subscales, at 4 and 7 years, in multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: The SDB clusters predicted approximately 20% to 100% increased odds of problematic behavior, controlling for 15 potential confounders. Early trajectories predicted problematic behavior at 7 years equally well as at 4 years. In Later trajectories, the ""Worst Case"" cluster, with peak symptoms at 30 months that abated thereafter, nonetheless at 7 years predicted hyperactivity (1.85 [1.30-2.63]), and conduct (1.60 [1.18-2.16]) and peer difficulties (1.37 [1.04-1.80]), whereas a ""Later Symptom"" cluster predicted emotional difficulties (1.65 [1.21-2.07]) and hyperactivity (1.88 [1.42-2.49]) . The 2 clusters with peak symptoms before 18 months that resolve thereafter still predicted 40% to 50% increased odds of behavior problems at 7 years. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, population-based, longitudinal study, early-life SDB symptoms had strong, persistent statistical effects on subsequent behavior in childhood. Findings suggest that SDB symptoms may require attention as early as the first year of life.","Adult Age Distribution Child *Child Behavior Child Behavior Disorders/*epidemiology/etiology/psychology Child, Preschool Cluster Analysis Cross-Sectional Studies England/epidemiology Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Male Parents/*psychology *Population Surveillance Pregnancy Questionnaires Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Risk Factors Sex Distribution Sleep Apnea Syndromes/*complications/epidemiology/psychology Time Factors"

Higher urinary BPA concentrations were cross-sectionally associated with heart disease in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 and NHANES 2005-2006, independent of traditional risk factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 758 incident coronary artery disease (CAD) cases and 861 controls followed for 10.8 years from the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer-Norfolk UK. Respondents aged 40 to 74 years and free of CAD, stroke, or diabetes mellitus provided baseline spot urine samples. Urinary BPA concentrations (median value, 1.3 ng/mL) were low. Per-SD (4.56 ng/mL) increases in urinary BPA concentration were associated with incident CAD in age-, sex-, and urinary creatinine-adjusted models (n=1919; odds ratio=1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.24; P=0.017). With CAD risk factor adjustment (including education, occupational social class, body mass index category, systolic blood pressure, lipid concentrations, and exercise), the estimate was similar but narrowly missed 2-sided significance (n=1744; odds ratio=1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.23; P=0.058). Sensitivity analyses with the fully adjusted model, excluding those with early CAD (<3-year follow-up), body mass index >30, or abnormal renal function or with additional adjustment for vitamin C, C-reactive protein, or alcohol consumption, all produced similar estimates, and all showed associations at P</=0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between higher BPA exposure (reflected in higher urinary concentrations) and incident CAD during >10 years of follow-up showed trends similar to previously reported cross-sectional findings in the more highly exposed NHANES respondents.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of maternal SSRI use during pregnancy on fetal growth and birth outcomes. DESIGN: The study was embedded in the Generation R Study, a prospective population-based study from fetal life onward. PARTICIPANTS: Seven thousand six hundred ninety-six pregnant women were included. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use was assessed by questionnaires in each trimester and verified by pharmacy records. Using depressive symptom scores from the Brief Symptom Inventory, 7027 pregnant mothers (91.3%) had no or low depressive symptoms, 570 pregnant mothers (7.4%) had clinically relevant depressive symptoms and used no SSRIs, and 99 pregnant mothers (1.3%) used SSRIs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fetal ultrasonography was performed in each trimester. We determined fetal body and head growth with repeated assessments of body and head size. The birth outcomes studied were preterm birth, small for gestational age, and low birth weight. RESULTS: Fetuses from mothers with prenatal depressive symptoms showed reduced body growth (beta=-4.4 g/wk; 95% CI: -6.3 to -2.4; P<.001) and head growth (beta=-0.08 mm/wk; 95% CI: -0.14 to -0.03; P=.003). Mothers using SSRIs during pregnancy had fewer depressive symptoms than mothers in the clinical symptom range. Prenatal SSRI use was not associated with reduced body growth but was associated with reduced fetal head growth (beta=-0.18 mm/wk; 95% CI: -0.32 to -0.07; P=.003). The SSRI-exposed children were at higher risk for preterm birth (odds ratio=2.14; 95% CI: 1.08 to 4.25; P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Untreated maternal depression was associated with slower rates of fetal body and head growth. Pregnant mothers treated with SSRIs had fewer depressive symptoms and their fetuses had no delay in body growth but had delayed head growth and were at increased risk for preterm birth. Further research on the implications of these findings is needed.","Adult Antidepressive Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use Cephalometry Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy Female Fetal Development/*drug effects Humans Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature Pregnancy Premature Birth/*chemically induced Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*chemically induced Questionnaires Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use Ultrasonography, Prenatal"
22394293,Neurosurgical complications of direct thrombin inhibitors--catastrophic hemorrhage after mild traumatic brain injury in a patient receiving dabigatran.,J Neurosurg,Garber ST and Sivakumar W and Schmidt RH,Missing,"Dabigatran etexilate is an oral anticoagulant that acts as a direct, competitive thrombin inhibitor. Large randomized clinical trials have shown higher doses of dabigatran (150 mg taken twice daily) to be superior to warfarin in terms of stroke and systemic embolism rates in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. As a result, in 2010 the US FDA approved the use of dabigatran for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran is especially attractive in the outpatient setting because patients do not require routine monitoring with prothrombin times or international normalized ratios. To date, no effective reversal agent for dabigatran in the event of catastrophic hemorrhage has been identified. The authors report a case of an elderly patient, being treated with dabigatran for atrial fibrillation, who presented with a rapidly expanding intracranial hemorrhage after a ground-level fall. This case highlights an impending neurosurgical quandary of complications secondary to this new anticoagulation agent and suggests potential options for management.","Aged, 80 and over Atrial Fibrillation/complications/drug therapy Benzimidazoles/*adverse effects/therapeutic use Brain Hemorrhage, Traumatic/*chemically induced/*etiology Brain Injuries/*complications Factor VII/therapeutic use Fatal Outcome Glasgow Coma Scale Humans International Normalized Ratio Male Partial Thromboplastin Time Subarachnoid Hemorrhage/etiology Thrombin/*antagonists & inhibitors Tomography, X-Ray Computed beta-Alanine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use"
22370316,Use of tanning beds and incidence of skin cancer.,J Clin Oncol,Zhang M and Qureshi AA and Geller AC and Frazier L and Hunter DJ and Han J,Missing,"PURPOSE: We sought to evaluate the risk effect of tanning bed use on skin cancers among teenage and young adults. We also expected to determine whether a dose-response relationship was evident. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We observed 73,494 female nurses for 20 years (from 1989 to 2009) in a large and well-characterized cohort in the United States and investigated whether frequency of tanning bed use during high school/college and at ages 25 to 35 years were associated with a risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma. We used Cox proportional hazards models and carefully adjusted for host risk factors, ultraviolet index of residence, and sun exposure behaviors at a young age. RESULTS: During follow-up, 5,506 nurses were diagnosed with BCC, 403 with SCC, and 349 with melanoma. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of skin cancer for an incremental increase in use of tanning beds of four times per year during both periods was 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11 to 1.19; P < .001) for BCC, 1.15 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.31; P = .03) for SCC, and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.27; P = .13) for melanoma. Compared with tanning bed use at ages 25 to 35 years, we found a significantly higher risk of BCC for use during high school/college (multivariable-adjusted HR for use more than six times per year compared with no use was 1.73 during high school/college v 1.28 at ages 25 to 35 years; P for heterogeneity < .001). CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence for a dose-response relationship between tanning bed use and the risk of skin cancers, especially BCC, and the association is stronger for patients with a younger age at exposure.","Adolescent Adult Age Distribution Beauty Culture/*instrumentation Carcinoma, Basal Cell/*epidemiology/etiology Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*epidemiology/etiology Cohort Studies Confidence Intervals Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation Female Humans Incidence Melanoma/*epidemiology/etiology Multivariate Analysis Prognosis Proportional Hazards Models Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology *Suntan Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects Young Adult"

We examined the acute effects on postprandial glucose and insulin levels of uninterrupted sitting compared with sitting interrupted by brief bouts of light- or moderate-intensity walking. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Overweight/obese adults (n = 19), aged 45-65 years, were recruited for a randomized three-period, three-treatment acute crossover trial: 1) uninterrupted sitting; 2) seated with 2-min bouts of light-intensity walking every 20 min; and 3) seated with 2-min bouts of moderate-intensity walking every 20 min. A standardized test drink was provided after an initial 2-h period of uninterrupted sitting. The positive incremental area under curves (iAUC) for glucose and insulin (mean [95% CI]) for the 5 h after the test drink (75 g glucose, 50 g fat) were calculated for the respective treatments. RESULTS: The glucose iAUC (mmol/L) . h after both activity-break conditions was reduced (light: 5.2 [4.1-6.6]; moderate: 4.9 [3.8-6.1]; both P < 0.01) compared with uninterrupted sitting (6.9 [5.5-8.7]). Insulin iAUC (pmol/L) . h was also reduced with both activity-break conditions (light: 633.6 [552.4-727.1]; moderate: 637.6 [555.5-731.9], P < 0.0001) compared with uninterrupted sitting (828.6 [722.0-950.9]). CONCLUSIONS: Interrupting sitting time with short bouts of light- or moderate-intensity walking lowers postprandial glucose and insulin levels in overweight/obese adults. This may improve glucose metabolism and potentially be an important public health and clinical intervention strategy for reducing cardiovascular risk.",Aged Blood Glucose/*metabolism Female Humans Insulin/*metabolism Male Middle Aged Obesity/*blood Postprandial Period/*physiology Walking/*physiology
22393131,Surrogate decision makers' interpretation of prognostic information: a mixed-methods study.,Ann Intern Med,Zier LS and Sottile PD and Hong SY and Weissfield LA and White DB,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about why surrogate decision makers for patients with advanced illness often have overly optimistic expectations about prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine how surrogates interpret prognostic statements and to explore factors influencing surrogates' interpretations of grim prognostic information. DESIGN: Multicenter, mixed-methods study. SETTING: Intensive care units of 3 hospitals in San Francisco, California. PARTICIPANTS: 80 surrogates of critically ill patients. MEASUREMENTS: Participants recorded their interpretation of 16 prognostic statements using a standard probability scale. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine whether participants interpreted statements more optimistically as the expressed probability of survival decreased. Fifteen surrogates whose responses exhibited this trend participated in a semistructured interview. RESULTS: Participants' interpretations of prognostic statements expressing a low risk for death were relatively accurate, but interpretations of statements conveying a high risk for death were more optimistic than the actual meaning (P < 0.001; generalized estimating equation model). Interpretations of the statement ""90% chance of surviving"" did not differ from the actual meaning, but interpretations of ""5% chance of surviving"" were more optimistic and showed substantial variability (median, 90% [interquartile range, 90% to 95%; P = 0.11] vs. 15% [interquartile range, 5% to 40%; P < 0.001], respectively). Two main themes from the interviews explained this trend: surrogates' need to register optimism in the face of a poor prognosis and surrogates' belief that patient attributes unknown to the physician would lead to better-than-predicted outcomes. LIMITATION: Surrogates' interpretations were elicited in an experimental setting rather than during actual clinician-surrogate conversations. CONCLUSION: Inaccurate interpretations of physicians' prognostications by surrogates arise partly from optimistic biases rather than simply from misunderstandings.

22357712,Stroke incidence in older US Hispanics: is foreign birth protective?,Stroke,Moon JR and Capistrant BD and Kawachi I and Avendano M and Subramanian SV and Bates LM and Glymour MM,Missing,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although Hispanics are the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States, relatively little is known about stroke risk in US Hispanics. We compare stroke incidence and socioeconomic predictors in US- and foreign-born Hispanics with patterns among non-Hispanic whites. METHODS: Health and Retirement Study participants aged 50+ years free of stroke in 1998 (mean baseline age, 66.3 years) were followed through 2008 for self- or proxy-reported first stroke (n=15 784; 1388 events). We used discrete-time survival analysis to compare stroke incidence among US-born (including those who immigrated before age 7 years) and foreign-born Hispanics with incidence in non-Hispanic whites. We also examined childhood and adult socioeconomic characteristics as predictors of stroke among Hispanics, comparing effect estimates with those for non-Hispanic whites. RESULTS: In age- and sex-adjusted models, US-born Hispanics had higher odds of stroke onset than non-Hispanic whites (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.08-1.90), but these differences were attenuated and nonsignificant in models that controlled for childhood and adulthood socioeconomic factors (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.80-1.42). In contrast, in models adjusted for all demographic and socioeconomic factors, foreign-born Hispanics had significantly lower stroke risk than non-Hispanic whites (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.41-0.81). The impact of socioeconomic predictors on stroke did not differ between Hispanics and whites. CONCLUSIONS: In this longitudinal national cohort, foreign-born Hispanics had lower incidence of stroke incidence than non-Hispanic whites and US-born Hispanics.

We developed an approach using a bioengineered mobilized cellular product enriched for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and tolerogenic graft facilitating cells (FCs) combined with nonmyeloablative conditioning; this approach resulted in engraftment, durable chimerism, and tolerance induction in recipients with highly mismatched related and unrelated donors. Eight recipients of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched kidney and FC/HSC transplants underwent conditioning with fludarabine, 200-centigray total body irradiation, and cyclophosphamide followed by posttransplant immunosuppression with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Subjects ranged in age from 29 to 56 years. HLA match ranged from five of six loci with related donors to one of six loci with unrelated donors. The absolute neutrophil counts reached a nadir about 1 week after transplant, with recovery by 2 weeks. Multilineage chimerism at 1 month ranged from 6 to 100%. The conditioning was well tolerated, with outpatient management after postoperative day 2. Two subjects exhibited transient chimerism and were maintained on low-dose tacrolimus monotherapy. One subject developed viral sepsis 2 months after transplant and experienced renal artery thrombosis. Five subjects experienced durable chimerism, demonstrated immunocompetence and donor-specific tolerance by in vitro proliferative assays, and were successfully weaned off all immunosuppression 1 year after transplant. None of the recipients produced anti-donor antibody or exhibited engraftment syndrome or graft-versus-host disease. These results suggest that manipulation of a mobilized stem cell graft and nonmyeloablative conditioning represents a safe, practical, and reproducible means of inducing durable chimerism and donor-specific tolerance in solid organ transplant recipients.",Adult Graft vs Host Disease/immunology HLA Antigens/*immunology Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods Humans Immune Tolerance/*immunology Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use Kidney Transplantation/*immunology Male Middle Aged Mycophenolic Acid/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use Tacrolimus/therapeutic use

Screening for cardiac disorders causing SCD in asymptomatic children has public appeal because of its apparent potential to avert tragedy; however, performance of the electrocardiogram (ECG) as a screening tool is unknown. We estimated (1) phenotypic (ECG- or echocardiogram [ECHO]-based) prevalence of selected pediatric disorders associated with SCD, and (2) sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of ECG, alone or with ECHO. METHODS: We systematically reviewed literature on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), long QT syndrome (LQTS), and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, the 3 most common disorders associated with SCD and detectable by ECG. RESULTS: We identified and screened 6954 abstracts, yielding 396 articles, and extracted data from 30. Summary phenotypic prevalences per 100 000 asymptomatic children were 45 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10-79) for HCM, 7 (95% CI: 0-14) for LQTS, and 136 (95% CI: 55-218) for Wolff-Parkinson-White. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for ECG were 0.91 for detecting HCM and 0.92 for LQTS. The negative predictive value of detecting either HCM or LQTS by using ECG was high; however, the positive predictive value varied by different sensitivity and specificity cut-points and the true prevalence of the conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide an evidence base for evaluating pediatric screening for these disorders. ECG, alone or with ECHO, was a sensitive test for mass screening and negative predictive value was high, but positive predictive value and false-positive rates varied.","Child Death, Sudden, Cardiac/*epidemiology/*etiology *Electrocardiography Heart Diseases/complications/*diagnosis/epidemiology Humans Incidence Mass Screening/*methods Prevalence World Health"
22324753,Long-term effects of three multicomponent exercise interventions on physical performance and fall-related psychological outcomes in community-dwelling older adults: a randomized controlled trial.,J Am Geriatr Soc,Freiberger E and Haberle L and Spirduso WW and Zijlstra GA,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term effects of three strength and balance exercise interventions on physical performance, fall-related psychological outcomes, and falls in older people. DESIGN: A single-blinded, four-group, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Community, Germany. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults aged 70 to 90 who had fallen in the past 6 months or reported fear of falling. INTERVENTION: After baseline assessment, 280 participants were randomly assigned to the control group (CG; no intervention; n = 80) or one of three strength and balance exercise interventions (the strength and balance group (SBG; strength and balance only; n = 63), the fitness group (FG; strength and balance plus endurance training; n = 64), or the multifaceted group (MG; strength and balance plus fall risk education; n = 73). The interventions consisted of 32 one-hour group sessions in 16 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Data on physical performance, fall-related psychological outcomes, and falls were collected for 24 months. RESULTS: Mixed-effects regression analyses showed improved short- and long-term (12 and 24 months, respectively) physical performance for the SBG and FG, particularly regarding mobility, balance, and walking speed (P < .05). The improvements in physical performance outcomes were most prominent in the FG. Fall-related psychological outcomes, number of falls, and injurious falls were not significantly different from in the control group. CONCLUSION: Training focusing on strength, balance, and endurance can enhance physical performance for up to 24 months in community-dwelling older adults. These findings did not translate to improved fall-related psychological outcomes or reduced incidence of falls. This demonstrates the need for a different approach (e.g., regarding intervention dose and components) to gain intervention benefits in the multiple domains that contribute to independence and well-being in older adults.","Accidental Falls/*prevention & control Aged Aged, 80 and over Exercise Therapy/*methods *Fear Female Germany Humans Male Postural Balance Questionnaires Regression Analysis Single-Blind Method Time"

DESIGN: Two-year prospective cohort study. SETTING: Seven general practices, with 67 100 registered patients. POPULATION: All women aged 40-54 years on the practices age-sex registers. METHODS: Baseline postal questionnaire, with follow-up questionnaires sent to naturally menstruating respondents at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of spontaneous resolution of heavy menstrual bleeding in naturally menstruating women. RESULTS: A total of 7121 baseline questionnaires were sent out, with an initial response rate of 63%. We recruited 2051 naturally menstruating women for the prospective cohort study. The spontaneous rate of resolution of heavy menstrual bleeding varied from 8.1% (95% CI 5.3-12%) in women aged 45-49 years, who had resolution without recurrence for 24 months, to 35% (95% CI 30-41%) in women aged 50-54 years, who had resolution without recurrence for 6 months. Rates were lower in those who reported interference with life from heavy menstrual bleeding. There was a strong association between the spontaneous resolution of heavy menstrual bleeding and skipped periods in women aged over 45 years. The association with 'cycle too variable to say' was significant, but weaker. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence, incidence and significant spontaneous rate of resolution of heavy menstrual bleeding in naturally menstruating women during the perimenopausal years. The rates have potential use for individual women, clinical decisions, devising and implementing interventions and planning the care of populations.","Adult England/epidemiology Epidemiologic Methods Female Humans Menorrhagia/*epidemiology Middle Aged Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics & numerical data Perimenopause/*physiology Recurrence Remission, Spontaneous Time Factors Women's Health Services/statistics & numerical data"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cross-sectional cohort includes all patients with cancer in Ontario older than age 65 years who completed a pain assessment as part of a provincial initiative of systematic symptom screening. Patients were assigned to mutually exclusive categories by pain score severity: 0, 1 to 3 (mild), 4 to 6 (moderate), and 7 to 10 (severe). We linked multiple provincial health databases to examine the proportion of patients with an OP within 7 days after or 30 days before the assessment date. We examined factors associated with OPs for patients with pain scores of 7 to 10. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with an OP increased as pain score severity increased: 10% of those with no pain, 24% of those with mild pain, 45% of those with moderate pain, and 67% of those with severe pain. More specifically, for those with severe pain, 41% filled an OP within 7 days of assessment for pain, and 26% had an OP from the 30 days before assessment for pain, leaving 33% without an OP. In multivariable analysis, factors associated with OPs are younger age, male sex, comorbid illness, cancer type, and assessment at home. CONCLUSION: Despite a generous time window for capturing OPs, the proportion of patients without an OP seems high. Further knowledge translation is required to maximize the impact of the symptom screening initiative in Ontario and to optimize management of cancer-related pain.","Aged Aged, 80 and over *Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use Cohort Studies Cross-Sectional Studies Drug Prescriptions/*statistics & numerical data Female Humans Male Medical Record Linkage Multivariate Analysis Neoplasms/*complications Odds Ratio Ontario Pain/*etiology *Pain Measurement Physician's Practice Patterns/*statistics & numerical data Severity of Illness Index"

We compared the survival rates of older patients with cancer in the VHA and fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare and examined whether differences in the stage at diagnosis, receipt of guideline-recommended therapies, and unmeasured characteristics explain survival differences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used propensity-score methods to compare all-cause and cancer-specific survival rates for men older than age 65 years who were diagnosed or received their first course of treatment for colorectal, lung, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma in VHA hospitals from 2001 to 2004 to similar FFS-Medicare enrollees diagnosed in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) areas in the same time frame. We examined the role of unmeasured factors by using sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: VHA patients versus similar FFS SEER-Medicare patients had higher survival rates of colon cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.93) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC; HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.95) and similar survival rates of rectal cancer (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.16), small-cell lung cancer (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.05), diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.18), and multiple myeloma (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.03). The diagnosis of VHA patients at earlier stages explained much of the survival advantages for colon cancer and NSCLC. Sensitivity analyses suggested that additional adjustment for the severity of comorbid disease or performance status could have substantial effects on estimated differences. CONCLUSION: The survival rate for older men with cancer in the VHA was better than or equivalent to the survival rate for similar FFS-Medicare beneficiaries. The VHA provision of high-quality care, particularly preventive care, can result in improved patient outcomes.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/economics/mortality Carcinoma, Small Cell/economics/mortality Comorbidity *Fee-for-Service Plans Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Lung Neoplasms/economics/mortality Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/economics/mortality Male *Medicare Multiple Myeloma/economics/mortality Neoplasms/diagnosis/*economics/*mortality/therapy Odds Ratio Proportional Hazards Models Rectal Neoplasms/economics/mortality SEER Program Survival Analysis Survival Rate United States/epidemiology United States Department of Veterans Affairs/*economics Veterans/*statistics & numerical data"

Plasma glucose was measured during exercise and for 60 min after exercise. Interstitial glucose was measured by continuous glucose monitoring 24 h before, during, and 24 h after exercise. RESULTS: Significant declines in blood glucose levels were seen in AR but not in RA throughout the first exercise modality, resulting in higher glucose levels in RA (AR = 5.5 +/- 0.7, RA = 9.2 +/- 1.2 mmol/L, P = 0.006 after 45 min of exercise). Glucose subsequently decreased in RA and increased in AR over the course of the second 45-min exercise bout, resulting in levels that were not significantly different by the end of exercise (AR = 7.5 +/- 0.8, RA = 6.9 +/- 1.0 mmol/L, P = 0.436). Although there were no differences in frequency of postexercise hypoglycemia, the duration (105 vs. 48 min) and severity (area under the curve 112 vs. 59 units min) of hypoglycemia were nonsignificantly greater after AR compared with RA. CONCLUSIONS: Performing resistance exercise before aerobic exercise improves glycemic stability throughout exercise and reduces the duration and severity of postexercise hypoglycemia for individuals with type 1 diabetes.","Adolescent Adult Blood Glucose/*metabolism/physiology Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*blood/complications/metabolism/*therapy Exercise/*physiology Exercise Therapy/methods Female Humans Hypoglycemia/blood/etiology Male Middle Aged *Resistance Training/methods Severity of Illness Index Time Factors Young Adult"
22378728,"Occupational burnout, eating behavior, and weight among working women.",Am J Clin Nutr,Nevanpera NJ and Hopsu L and Kuosma E and Ukkola O and Uitti J and Laitinen JH,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Eating behavior affects weight and thus the development of obesity. Studies on the effect of occupational burnout (exhaustive fatigue, cynicism, and lost occupational self-respect caused by chronic work stress) on eating behavior are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate associations between occupational burnout, eating behavior, and weight among working women. DESIGN: A total of 230 working women participated in a randomized controlled intervention trial (Nuadu) that aimed at changing the health behaviors of those with health risks. We assessed eating behavior using the Three-Factor Eating Behavior Questionnaire 18 and burnout using the Bergen Burnout Indicator 15 at both baseline and 12 mo. Body weight and percentage body fat were also measured at baseline and at 12 mo. The intervention and control groups were combined and divided by burnout and weight-change variables. RESULTS: Women experiencing burnout at baseline had significantly higher scores in emotional eating (EE; P = 0.002) and uncontrolled eating (UE; P = 0.001) than did those without burnout. A significant difference was found between the change in UE from baseline to 12 mo in those with and without burnout (P = 0.05). UE decreased significantly among those without burnout at baseline (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Those experiencing burnout may be more vulnerable to EE and UE and have a hindered ability to make changes in their eating behavior. We recommend that burnout should be treated first and that burnout and eating behavior should be evaluated in obesity treatment.","Adiposity Adult Body Mass Index *Body Weight Burnout, Professional/psychology/*therapy Diet/*adverse effects Feeding Behavior/psychology Female Finland Follow-Up Studies Food Habits/*psychology Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Humans Life Style Middle Aged Obesity/pathology/prevention & control/psychology Overnutrition/pathology/prevention & control/*psychology Overweight/pathology/prevention & control/psychology Psychiatric Status Rating Scales *Psychotherapy, Group"
22381159,How the 2008 stock market crash and seasons affect total and cardiac deaths in Los Angeles County.,Am J Cardiol,Schwartz BG and Pezzullo JC and McDonald SA and Poole WK and Kloner RA,Missing,"Various stressors trigger cardiac death. The objective was to investigate a possible relation between a stock market crash and cardiac death in a large population within the United States. We obtained daily stock market data (Dow Jones Industrial Average Index), death certificate data for daily deaths in Los Angeles County (LA), and annual LA population estimates for 2005 through 2008. The 4 years death rate curves (2005 through 2008) were averaged into a single curve to illustrate annual trends. Data were ""deseasonalized"" by subtracting from the daily observed value the average value for that day of year. There was marked seasonal variation in total and cardiac death rates. Even in the mild LA climate, death rates were higher in winter versus summer including total death (+17%), circulatory death (+24%), coronary heart disease death (+28%), and myocardial infarction death (+38%) rates (p <0.0001 for each). Absolute coronary heart disease death rates have decreased since 1985. After accounting for seasonal variation, the large stock market crash in October 2008 did not affect death rates in LA. Death rates remained at or below seasonal averages during the stock market crash. In conclusion, after correcting for seasonal variation, the stock market crash in October 2008 was not associated with an increase in total or cardiac death in LA. Annual coronary heart disease death rates continue to decrease. However, seasonal variation (specifically winter) remains a trigger for death and coronary heart disease death even in LA where winters are mild.","California/epidemiology Cardiovascular Diseases/*mortality/psychology Cause of Death/trends *Economics Humans Retrospective Studies Risk Factors *Seasons Stress, Psychological/*mortality/psychology"
22412035,Rising national prevalence of life-limiting conditions in children in England.,Pediatrics,Fraser LK and Miller M and Hain R and Norman P and Aldridge J and McKinney PA and Parslow RC,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Life-limiting conditions (LLCs) describe diseases with no reasonable hope of cure that will ultimately be fatal. For children with these diseases, palliative care services should be available but few data are available to estimate the burden of these conditions. METHODS: Children (0-19 years) with LLCs were identified within an English Hospital Episode Statistics dataset (2000/2001-2009/2010) by applying a customized coding framework of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, disease codes. Prevalence per 10 000 population (0-19 years) was calculated by age, diagnostic group, ethnicity, deprivation, and region for each year. RESULTS: The Hospital Episode Statistics extract contained 175 286 individuals with 1 or more LLCs of which congenital anomalies were the most common (31%). Prevalence increased over 10 years from 25 to 32 per 10 000 population. Prevalence in the South Asian (48 per 10 000); black (42 per 10 000); and Chinese, mixed, and ""other"" (31 per 10 000) populations were statistically significantly higher compared with the white population (27 per 10 000). Prevalence shows an inverse J-shaped relationship with 5 categories of deprivation, with the highest prevalence in the most deprived areas and the lowest in the second least deprived. CONCLUSIONS: In 2010, the prevalence of LLCs in children in England was double the previously reported estimates and had increased annually in all areas over the past decade. This clearly identifies an escalating need for specialist pediatric palliative care services. When planning services for these increasing needs, the excess prevalence in ethnic minority groups, especially in deprived areas, needs to be considered.","Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Critical Illness/*epidemiology England/epidemiology Female Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Palliative Care Prevalence Retrospective Studies Terminally Ill/*statistics & numerical data Young Adult"
22411665,Projected clinical outcomes of glaucoma screening in African American individuals.,Arch Ophthalmol,Ladapo JA and Kymes SM and Ladapo JA and Nwosu VC and Pasquale LR,nyumc,"OBJECTIVES: To project the clinical impact of routine glaucoma screening on visual outcomes in middle-aged African American individuals and help guide glaucoma screening policy. METHODS: Using data from the Eye Diseases Prevalence Research Group and Baltimore Eye Study, we developed a microsimulation model to project visual outcomes in African American individuals screened for glaucoma under a national screening policy using frequency-doubling technology. We projected the impact of universal screening on glaucoma-related visual impairment (acuity worse than 20/40 but better than 20/200 in the better-seeing eye) and blindness (acuity 20/200 or worse in the better-seeing eye). The diagnostic characteristics of frequency-doubling technology and the hazard ratio for glaucoma progression in treated patients were informed by meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: Implementation of a national glaucoma screening policy for a cohort of African American individuals between the ages of 50 and 59 years without known glaucoma would reduce the lifetime prevalence of undiagnosed glaucoma from 50% to 27%, the prevalence of glaucoma-related visual impairment from 4.6% to 4.4% (4.1% relative decrease), and the prevalence of glaucoma-related blindness from 6.1% to 5.6% (7.1% relative decrease). We project the cost of the program to be $80 per screened individual, considering only the cost of frequency-doubling technology and confirmatory eye examinations. The number needed to screen to diagnose 1 person with glaucoma is 58. The number needed to screen to prevent 1 person from developing visual impairment is 875. CONCLUSIONS: Routine glaucoma screening for middle-aged African American individuals is potentially clinically effective but its impact on visual impairment and blindness may be modest. However, we did not assess the impact on visual field loss.","African Americans/*statistics & numerical data Aged Aged, 80 and over Blindness/economics/ethnology/prevention & control Glaucoma/economics/*ethnology/*prevention & control Health Care Costs Health Policy Humans Incidence Mass Screening/economics/*statistics & numerical data Middle Aged *Models, Statistical Monte Carlo Method Prevalence Sensitivity and Specificity United States/epidemiology"
22412075,Red meat consumption and mortality: results from 2 prospective cohort studies.,Arch Intern Med,Pan A and Sun Q and Bernstein AM and Schulze MB and Manson JE and Stampfer MJ and Willett WC and Hu FB,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Red meat consumption has been associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases. However, its relationship with mortality remains uncertain. METHODS: We prospectively observed 37 698 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2008) and 83 644 women from the Nurses' Health Study (1980-2008) who were free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer at baseline. Diet was assessed by validated food frequency questionnaires and updated every 4 years. RESULTS: We documented 23 926 deaths (including 5910 CVD and 9464 cancer deaths) during 2.96 million person-years of follow-up. After multivariate adjustment for major lifestyle and dietary risk factors, the pooled hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI) of total mortality for a 1-serving-per-day increase was 1.13 (1.07-1.20) for unprocessed red meat and 1.20 (1.15-1.24) for processed red meat. The corresponding HRs (95% CIs) were 1.18 (1.13-1.23) and 1.21 (1.13-1.31) for CVD mortality and 1.10 (1.06-1.14) and 1.16 (1.09-1.23) for cancer mortality. We estimated that substitutions of 1 serving per day of other foods (including fish, poultry, nuts, legumes, low-fat dairy, and whole grains) for 1 serving per day of red meat were associated with a 7% to 19% lower mortality risk. We also estimated that 9.3% of deaths in men and 7.6% in women in these cohorts could be prevented at the end of follow-up if all the individuals consumed fewer than 0.5 servings per day (approximately 42 g/d) of red meat. CONCLUSIONS: Red meat consumption is associated with an increased risk of total, CVD, and cancer mortality.

22381024,Role of carbohydrate modification in weight management among obese children: a randomized clinical trial.,J Pediatr,Kirk S and Brehm B and Saelens BE and Woo JG and Kissel E and D'Alessio D and Bolling C and Daniels SR,cchmc,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and safety of carbohydrate (CHO)-modified diets with a standard portion-controlled (PC) diet in obese children. STUDY DESIGN: Obese children (n=102) aged 7-12 years were randomly assigned to a 3-month intervention of a low-CHO (LC), reduced glycemic load (RGL), or standard PC diet, along with weekly dietary counseling and biweekly group exercise. Anthropometry, dietary adherence, and clinical measures were evaluated at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. Analyses applied intention-to-treat longitudinal mixed models. RESULTS: Eighty-five children (83%) completed the 12-month assessment. Daily caloric intake decreased from baseline to all time points for all diet groups (P<.0001), although LC diet adherence was persistently lower (P<.0002). At 3 months, body mass index z score was lower in all diet groups (LC, -0.27 +/- 0.04; RGL, -0.20 +/- 0.04; PC, -0.21 +/- 0.04; P<.0001) and was maintained at 6 months, with similar results for waist circumference and percent body fat. At 12 months, participants in all diet groups had lower body mass index z scores than at baseline (LC, -0.21 +/- 0.04; RGL, -0.28 +/- 0.04; PC, -0.31 +/- 0.04; P<.0001), and lower percent body fat, but no reductions in waist circumference were maintained. All diets demonstrated some improved clinical measures. CONCLUSION: Diets with modified CHO intake were as effective as a PC diet for weight management in obese children. However, the lower adherence to the LC diet suggests that this regimen is more difficult for children to follow, particularly in the long term.","Body Mass Index Child *Diet, Carbohydrate-Restricted Diet, Reducing Energy Intake Female Glycemic Index Humans Lipids/blood Male Obesity/blood/*diet therapy Patient Compliance Weight Loss"
22412106,Long-term analgesic use after low-risk surgery: a retrospective cohort study.,Arch Intern Med,Alam A and Gomes T and Zheng H and Mamdani MM and Juurlink DN and Bell CM,Missing,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the risk of long-term analgesic use after low-risk surgery in older adults not previously prescribed analgesics. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked, population-based administrative data in Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 1997, through December 31, 2008. We identified Ontario residents 66 years and older who were dispensed an opioid within 7 days of a short-stay surgery (cataract surgery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate, or varicose vein stripping) and assessed the risk of long-term opioid use, defined as a prescription for an opioid within 60 days of the 1-year anniversary of the surgery. In a secondary analysis, we examined the risk of long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the association between postsurgical use of analgesics and long-term use. RESULTS: Among 391,139 opioid-naive patients undergoing short-stay surgery, opioids were newly prescribed to 27,636 patients (7.1%) within 7 days of being discharged from the hospital, and opioids were prescribed to 30,145 patients (7.7%) at 1 year from surgery. An increase in the use of oxycodone was found during this time (from 5.4% within 7 days to 15.9% at 1 year). In our primary analysis, patients receiving an opioid prescription within 7 days of surgery were 44% more likely to become long-term opioid users within 1 year compared with those who received no such prescription (adjusted odds ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.39-1.50). In a secondary analysis, among 383,780 NSAID-naive patients undergoing short-stay surgery, NSAIDs were prescribed to 1169 patients (0.3%) within 7 days of discharge and to 30,080 patients (7.8%) at 1 year from surgery. Patients who began taking NSAIDs within 7 days of surgery were almost 4 times more likely to become long-term NSAID users compared with patients with no such prescription (adjusted odds ratio, 3.74; 95% CI, 3.27-4.28). CONCLUSION: Prescription of analgesics immediately after ambulatory surgery occurs frequently in older adults and is associated with long-term use.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage Case-Control Studies Confidence Intervals Drug Administration Schedule Drug Utilization/*statistics & numerical data Female Follow-Up Studies Humans *Length of Stay Long-Term Care Male Odds Ratio Ontario Pain, Postoperative/diagnosis/*drug therapy Retrospective Studies Surgical Procedures, Minimally Invasive/adverse effects/methods Surgical Procedures, Operative/adverse effects/methods Treatment Outcome"

Warmer temperatures accelerate growth and reproduction of ectotherms, whereas these processes are slowed or halted in colder temperatures. Female blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus inhabiting the Chesapeake Bay, exhibit a seasonal migratory behavior that is closely tied with spawning and the release of larvae. To better understand reproductive activities of the migratory adult females, we examined two reproductive parameters of these crabs sampled monthly (April-December, 2006): the levels of vitellogenin (VtG) in the hemolymph and VtG expression in the hepatopancreas and ovary. The full-length cDNA of VtG (CasVtG-ova) has been isolated from the ovary. The putative CasVtG sequence found in the ovary is >99% identical to that of the hepatopancreas and is related most closely to the sequences reported in other crab species. In female C. sapidus, the hepatopancreas produces over 99% of the total VtG toward the ovarian development. Ovarian stages 2 and 3 in the sampled females are characterized by significant high levels of VtG in hemolymph and VtG expression in both the hepatopancreas and ovary. However, during the southbound migration in fall, females at ovarian stages 2 and 3 have decreased VtG levels, compared to those in spring and summer. The decreased vitellogenesis activity during the fall migration suggests seasonal adaptation to ensure successful spawning and the larval release.",Missing

METHODS: Symptomatic women aged 45 to 63 years (N = 176; 3-36 months since last menstruation) were randomly assigned to an aerobic training or a control group. The intervention included unsupervised aerobic training for 50 minutes four times weekly for 24 weeks, whereas the control group attended health lectures twice a month. Symptoms were reported twice a day using a mobile phone. The perceived disturbance of menopausal symptoms (night sweats, mood swings, irritability, depressive mood, headache, vaginal dryness, and urinary symptoms) was evaluated on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high). Multilevel mixed-effect ordinal regression models were based on 17,000 responses during 24 weeks. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-four women continued until the end of the study (88% compliance rate). Baseline prevalence was as follows: night sweats, 50% to 60%; irritability and depression, 20% to 25%; mood swings, 25% to 30%; headache and urinary problems, 15% to 20%; and vaginal dryness, 10% to 15%. The prevalence of all symptoms except vaginal dryness decreased among intervention groups. According to multilevel mixed-effect ordinal regression analysis, night sweats and mood swings (P < 0.001) and disturbance of the mood swings (P < 0.001) and irritability (P < 0.001) were reduced more among the women in the intervention group than in the control group.

METHODS: We conducted a 2-arm, 24-month randomized effectiveness trial in 3 Boston community health centers (from February 1, 2008, through May 2, 2011). Participants were 365 obese patients receiving hypertension treatment (71.2% black, 13.1% Hispanic, 68.5% female, and 32.9% with less than a high school educational level). We randomized participants to usual care or a behavioral intervention that promoted weight loss and hypertension self-management using eHealth components. The intervention included tailored behavior change goals, self-monitoring, and skills training, available via a website or interactive voice response; 18 telephone counseling calls; primary care provider endorsement; 12 optional group support sessions; and links with community resources. RESULTS: At 24 months, weight change in the intervention group compared with that in the usual care group was -1.03 kg (95% CI, -2.03 to -0.03 kg). Twenty-four-month change in body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) in the intervention group compared with that in the usual care group was -0.38 (95% CI, -0.75 to -0.004). Intervention participants had larger mean weight losses during the 24 months compared with that in the usual care group (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, -1.07 kg; 95% CI, -1.94 to -0.22). Mean systolic blood pressure was not significantly lower in the intervention arm compared with the usual care arm.

22419342,Pain management for women in labour: an overview of systematic reviews.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Jones L and Othman M and Dowswell T and Alfirevic Z and Gates S and Newburn M and Jordan S and Lavender T and Neilson JP,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The pain that women experience during labour is affected by multiple physiological and psychosocial factors and its intensity can vary greatly. Most women in labour require pain relief. Pain management strategies include non-pharmacological interventions (that aim to help women cope with pain in labour) and pharmacological interventions (that aim to relieve the pain of labour). OBJECTIVES: To summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on the efficacy and safety of non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to manage pain in labour. We considered findings from non-Cochrane systematic reviews if there was no relevant Cochrane review. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 5), The Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2 of 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 31 May 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to 31 May 2011) to identify all relevant systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials of pain management in labour. Each of the contributing Cochrane reviews (nine new, six updated) followed a generic protocol with 13 common primary efficacy and safety outcomes. Each Cochrane review included comparisons with placebo, standard care or with a different intervention according to a predefined hierarchy of interventions. Two review authors extracted data and assessed methodological quality, and data were checked by a third author. This overview is a narrative summary of the results obtained from individual reviews. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 15 Cochrane reviews (255 included trials) and three non-Cochrane reviews (55 included trials) for inclusion within this overview. For all interventions, with available data, results are presented as comparisons of: 1. Intervention versus placebo or standard care; 2. Different forms of the same intervention (e.g. one opioid versus another opioid); 3. One type of intervention versus a different type of intervention (e.g. TENS versus opioid). Not all reviews included results for all comparisons. Most reviews compared the intervention with placebo or standard care, but with the exception of opioids and epidural analgesia, there were few direct comparisons between different forms of the same intervention, and even fewer comparisons between different interventions. Based on these three comparisons, we have categorised interventions into: "" What works"" ,""What may work"", and ""Insufficient evidence to make a judgement"".WHAT WORKSEvidence suggests that epidural, combined spinal epidural (CSE) and inhaled analgesia effectively manage pain in labour, but may give rise to adverse effects. Epidural, and inhaled analgesia effectively relieve pain when compared with placebo or a different type of intervention (epidural versus opioids). Combined-spinal epidurals relieve pain more quickly than traditional or low dose epidurals. Women receiving inhaled analgesia were more likely to experience vomiting, nausea and dizziness.When compared with placebo or opioids, women receiving epidural analgesia had more instrumental vaginal births and caesarean sections for fetal distress, although there was no difference in the rates of caesarean section overall. Women receiving epidural analgesia were more likely to experience hypotension, motor blockade, fever or urinary retention. Less urinary retention was observed in women receiving CSE than in women receiving traditional epidurals. More women receiving CSE than low-dose epidural experienced pruritus. WHAT MAY WORKThere is some evidence to suggest that immersion in water, relaxation, acupuncture, massage and local anaesthetic nerve blocks or non-opioid drugs may improve management of labour pain, with few adverse effects. Evidence was mainly limited to single trials. These interventions relieved pain and improved satisfaction with pain relief (immersion, relaxation, acupuncture, local anaesthetic nerve blocks, non-opioids) and childbirth experience (immersion, relaxation, non-opioids) when compared with placebo or standard care. Relaxation was associated with fewer assisted vaginal births and acupuncture was associated with fewer assisted vaginal births and caesarean sections.INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCEThere is insufficient evidence to make judgements on whether or not hypnosis, biofeedback, sterile water injection, aromatherapy, TENS, or parenteral opioids are more effective than placebo or other interventions for pain management in labour. In comparison with other opioids more women receiving pethidine experienced adverse effects including drowsiness and nausea. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Most methods of non-pharmacological pain management are non-invasive and appear to be safe for mother and baby, however, their efficacy is unclear, due to limited high quality evidence. In many reviews, only one or two trials provided outcome data for analysis and the overall methodological quality of the trials was low. High quality trials are needed.There is more evidence to support the efficacy of pharmacological methods, but these have more adverse effects. Thus, epidural analgesia provides effective pain relief but at the cost of increased instrumental vaginal birth.It remains important to tailor methods used to each woman's wishes, needs and circumstances, such as anticipated duration of labour, the infant's condition, and any augmentation or induction of labour.A major challenge in compiling this overview, and the individual systematic reviews on which it is based, has been the variation in use of different process and outcome measures in different trials, particularly assessment of pain and its relief, and effects on the neonate after birth. This made it difficult to pool results from otherwise similar studies, and to derive conclusions from the totality of evidence. Other important outcomes have simply not been assessed in trials; thus, despite concerns for 30 years or more about the effects of maternal opioid administration during labour on subsequent neonatal behaviour and its influence on breastfeeding, only two out of 57 trials of opioids reported breastfeeding as an outcome. We therefore strongly recommend that the outcome measures, agreed through wide consultation for this project, are used in all future trials of methods of pain management.","Acupuncture Analgesia Administration, Inhalation Analgesia, Epidural/adverse effects/methods Analgesia, Obstetrical/adverse effects/*methods Analgesics/administration & dosage/adverse effects Cesarean Section/utilization Female Humans Immersion Labor Pain/*therapy Massage Patient Satisfaction Pregnancy Relaxation Therapy/methods Review Literature as Topic"

We therefore conducted a population-based exploratory analysis of potential factors associated with financial hardship and treatment nonadherence during and following adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with stage III colon cancer between 2008 and 2010 were identified from a population-based cancer registry representing 13 counties in Washington state. Patients were asked to complete a comprehensive survey on treatment-related costs. Patients were considered to have experienced financial hardship if they accrued debt, sold or refinanced their home, borrowed money from friends or family, or experienced a 20% or greater decline in their annual income as a result of treatment-related expenses. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate factors associated with financial hardship and treatment nonadherence. RESULTS: A total of 284 responses were obtained from 555 eligible patients (response rate, 51.2%). Nearly all patients in the final sample were insured during treatment. In this sample, 38% of patients reported one or more financial hardships as a result of treatment. The factors most closely associated with treatment-related financial hardship were younger age and lower annual household income. Younger age, lower income, and unemployment or disability (which occurred in most instances following diagnosis) were most closely associated with treatment nonadherence. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer may experience financial hardship, despite having health insurance coverage. Interventions to help at-risk patients early on during therapy may prevent long-term financial adverse effects.","Adult Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Analysis of Variance Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/economics Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/surgery *Cost of Illness Cross-Sectional Studies Female Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Humans Insurance, Health/*economics Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Patient Compliance Predictive Value of Tests Prognosis Registries Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Sex Factors Socioeconomic Factors Survival Analysis Washington"
22391016,A systematic review of retention of adult advanced life support knowledge and skills in healthcare providers.,Resuscitation,Yang CW and Yen ZS and McGowan JE and Chen HC and Chiang WC and Mancini ME and Soar J and Lai MS and Ma MH,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: Advanced life support (ALS) guidelines are widely adopted for healthcare provider training with recommendations for retraining every two years or longer. This systematic review studies the retention of adult ALS knowledge and skills following completion of an ALS course in healthcare providers. METHODS: We retrieved original articles using Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and PubMed, and reviewed reference citations to identify additional studies. We extracted data from included articles using a structured approach and organized outcomes by evaluation method, and knowledge and skills retention. RESULTS: Among 336 articles retrieved, 11 papers were included. Most studies used multiple-choice questionnaires to evaluate knowledge retention and cardiac arrest simulation or other skills tests to evaluate skills retention. All studies reported variable rates of knowledge or skills deterioration over time, from 6 weeks to 2 years after training. Two studies noted retention of knowledge at 18 months and up to 2 years, and one reported skills retention at 3 months. Clinical experience, either prior to or after the courses, has a positive impact on retention of knowledge and skills. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of large well-designed studies examining the retention of adult ALS knowledge and skills in healthcare providers. The available evidence suggests that ALS knowledge and skills decay by 6 months to 1 year after training and that skills decay faster than knowledge. Additional studies are needed to help provide evidence-based recommendations for assessment of current knowledge and skills and need for refresher training to maximize maintenance of ALS competency.",Advanced Cardiac Life Support/*education *Clinical Competence Health Personnel/*education Humans

22431642,Electroconvulsive therapy reduces frontal cortical connectivity in severe depressive disorder.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Perrin JS and Merz S and Bennett DM and Currie J and Steele DJ and Reid IC and Schwarzbauer C,Missing,"To date, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most potent treatment in severe depression. Although ECT has been successfully applied in clinical practice for over 70 years, the underlying mechanisms of action remain unclear. We used functional MRI and a unique data-driven analysis approach to examine functional connectivity in the brain before and after ECT treatment. Our results show that ECT has lasting effects on the functional architecture of the brain. A comparison of pre- and posttreatment functional connectivity data in a group of nine patients revealed a significant cluster of voxels in and around the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortical region (Brodmann areas 44, 45, and 46), where the average global functional connectivity was considerably decreased after ECT treatment (P < 0.05, family-wise error-corrected). This decrease in functional connectivity was accompanied by a significant improvement (P < 0.001) in depressive symptoms; the patients' mean scores on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale pre- and posttreatment were 36.4 (SD = 4.9) and 10.7 (SD = 9.6), respectively. The findings reported here add weight to the emerging ""hyperconnectivity hypothesis"" in depression and support the proposal that increased connectivity may constitute both a biomarker for mood disorder and a potential therapeutic target.",Depression/*therapy *Electroconvulsive Therapy Frontal Lobe/*physiopathology Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging

METHODS: The Infant Development, Environment, and Lifestyle study, a prospective, longitudinal study of prenatal MA exposure and child outcome, enrolled subjects postpartum in Los Angeles, California; Honolulu, Hawaii; Des Moines, Iowa; and Tulsa, Oklahoma. Prenatal exposure was determined by maternal self-report and/or meconium results. Exposed and comparison groups were matched on race, birth weight, public health insurance, and education. Mothers in the comparison group denied use and had a negative meconium screen for amphetamines. Prenatal exposures to tobacco, alcohol, or marijuana occurred in both groups. At ages 3 and 5 years, 330 children (166 exposed and 164 comparison) were assessed for behavior problems by using the caregiver report on the Child Behavior Checklist. General linear mixed models were used to determine the effects of prenatal MA exposure, including heavy exposure (>/=3 days per week), age, and the interaction of exposure and age on behavior problems with adjustment for other drugs of abuse and environmental risk factors. RESULTS: MA exposure was associated with increased emotional reactivity and anxious/depressed problems at both ages and externalizing and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder problems by age 5 years. Heavy exposure was related to attention problems and withdrawn behavior at both ages. There were no effects of MA on the internalizing or total behavior problems scales. CONCLUSIONS: This first report of behavior problems in patients as young as 3 years associated with MA exposure identifies an important public health problem. Continued follow-up can inform the development of preventive intervention programs.","Adaptation, Psychological Adult Central Nervous System Stimulants/adverse effects Child Behavior/drug effects/*psychology Child Development/*drug effects Child, Preschool Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects Methamphetamine/*adverse effects Pregnancy Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/chemically induced/physiopathology/*psychology Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Substance-Related Disorders/physiopathology/*psychology"

Research in healthy populations has shown reduced inflammation with higher dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which could potentially reduce fatigue. This study investigated fatigue, inflammation, and intake of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs among breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Six hundred thirty-three survivors (mean age, 56 years; stage I to IIIA) participating in the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle Study completed a food frequency/dietary supplement questionnaire and provided a blood sample assayed for C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (30 months after diagnosis) and completed the Piper Fatigue Scale and Short Form-36 (SF-36) vitality scale (39 months after diagnosis). Analysis of covariance and logistic regression models tested relationships between inflammation and fatigue, inflammation and omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA intake, and PUFA intake and fatigue, controlling for three incremental levels of confounders. Fatigue was analyzed continuously (Piper scales) and dichotomously (SF-36 vitality </= 50). RESULTS: Behavioral (P = .003) and sensory (P = .001) fatigue scale scores were higher by increasing CRP tertile; relationships were attenuated after adjustment for medication use and comorbidity. Survivors with high CRP had 1.8 times greater odds of fatigue after full adjustment (P < .05). Higher intake of omega-6 relative to omega-3 PUFAs was associated with greater CRP (P = .01 after full adjustment) and greater odds of fatigue (odds ratio, 2.6 for the highest v lowest intake; P < .05). CONCLUSION: Results link higher intake of omega-3 PUFAs, decreased inflammation, and decreased physical aspects of fatigue. Future studies should test whether omega-3 supplementation may reduce fatigue among significantly fatigued breast cancer survivors.","Adult Aged Analysis of Variance Breast Neoplasms/complications/pathology/*therapy C-Reactive Protein/metabolism Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/complications/pathology/therapy Cohort Studies *Dietary Supplements Fatigue/etiology/physiopathology/*therapy Fatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage/blood Fatty Acids, Omega-6/*administration & dosage/blood Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Inflammation/etiology/physiopathology/*therapy Inflammation Mediators/analysis Logistic Models Middle Aged Odds Ratio Prospective Studies Risk Assessment Serum Amyloid A Protein/metabolism Survivors Treatment Outcome"

However, the short-term effect is less certain, especially in women, effects on cancer incidence are largely unknown, and the time course of risk and benefit in primary prevention is unclear. We studied cancer deaths in all trials of daily aspirin versus control and the time course of effects of low-dose aspirin on cancer incidence and other outcomes in trials in primary prevention. METHODS: We studied individual patient data from randomised trials of daily aspirin versus no aspirin in prevention of vascular events. Death due to cancer, all non-vascular death, vascular death, and all deaths were assessed in all eligible trials. In trials of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention, we also established the time course of effects on incident cancer, major vascular events, and major extracranial bleeds, with stratification by age, sex, and smoking status. RESULTS: Allocation to aspirin reduced cancer deaths (562 vs 664 deaths; odds ratio [OR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.96, p=0.008; 34 trials, 69,224 participants), particularly from 5 years onwards (92 vs 145; OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.82, p=0.0005), resulting in fewer non-vascular deaths overall (1021 vs 1173; OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78-0.96, p=0.003; 51 trials, 77,549 participants). In trials in primary prevention, the reduction in non-vascular deaths accounted for 87 (91%) of 96 deaths prevented. In six trials of daily low-dose aspirin in primary prevention (35,535 participants), aspirin reduced cancer incidence from 3 years onwards (324 vs 421 cases; OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.88, p=0.0003) in women (132 vs 176; OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.94, p=0.01) and in men (192 vs 245; OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63-0.93, p=0.008). The reduced risk of major vascular events on aspirin was initially offset by an increased risk of major bleeding, but effects on both outcomes diminished with increasing follow-up, leaving only the reduced risk of cancer (absolute reduction 3.13 [95% CI 1.44-4.82] per 1000 patients per year) from 3 years onwards. Case-fatality from major extracranial bleeds was also lower on aspirin than on control (8/203 vs 15/132; OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12-0.83, p=0.009). INTERPRETATION: Alongside the previously reported reduction by aspirin of the long-term risk of cancer death, the short-term reductions in cancer incidence and mortality and the decrease in risk of major extracranial bleeds with extended use, and their low case-fatality, add to the case for daily aspirin in prevention of cancer.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned patients who had completed primary cancer treatment within the past 24 months in any of four Korean hospitals and had reported moderate to severe fatigue for at least 1 week to participate in a 12-week, Internet-based, individually tailored CRF education program or to receive routine care. We based the program on the CRF guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and incorporated the transtheoretic model (TTM). At baseline and 12 weeks, we used the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) as primary outcomes and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) for secondary outcomes. RESULTS: We recruited 273 participants and randomly assigned 136 to the intervention group. Compared with the control group, the intervention group had an improvement in fatigue as shown by a significantly greater decrease in BFI global score (-0.66 points; 95% CI -1.04 to -0.27) and FSS total score (-0.49; 95% CI, -0.78 to -0.21). In secondary outcomes, the intervention group experienced a significantly greater decrease in HADS anxiety score (-0.90; 95% CI, -1.51 to -0.29) as well as global quality of life (5.22; 95% CI, 0.93 to 9.50) and several functioning scores of the EORTC QLQ-C30.

22403048,Alcohol consumption and risk of stroke in women.,Stroke,Jimenez M and Chiuve SE and Glynn RJ and Stampfer MJ and Camargo CA Jr and Willett WC and Manson JE and Rexrode KM,Missing,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Light-to-moderate alcohol consumption has been consistently associated with lower risk of heart disease, but data for stroke are less certain. A lower risk of stroke with light-to-moderate alcohol intake has been suggested, but the dose response among women remains uncertain and the data in this subgroup have been sparse. METHODS: A total of 83 578 female participants of the Nurses' Health Study who were free of diagnosed cardiovascular disease and cancer at baseline were followed-up from 1980 to 2006. Data on self-reported alcohol consumption were assessed at baseline and updated approximately every 4 years, whereas stroke and potential confounder data were updated at baseline and biennially. Strokes were classified according to the National Survey of Stroke criteria. RESULTS: We observed 2171 incident strokes over 1 695 324 person-years. In multivariable adjusted analyses, compared to abstainers, the relative risks of stroke were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.75-0.92) for <5 g/d, 0.79 (95% CI, 0.70-0.90) for 5 to 14.9 g/d, 0.87 (0.72-1.05) for 15 to 29.9 g/d, and 1.06 (95% CI, 0.86-1.30) for 30 to 45 g/d. Results were similar for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Light-to-moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a lower risk of total stroke.

22430458,Language functions in preterm-born children: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Pediatrics,van Noort-van der Spek IL and Franken MC and Weisglas-Kuperus N,erasmusmc,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Preterm-born children (<37 weeks' gestation) have higher rates of language function problems compared with term-born children. It is unknown whether these problems decrease, deteriorate, or remain stable over time. The goal of this research was to determine the developmental course of language functions in preterm-born children from 3 to 12 years of age. METHODS: Computerized databases Embase, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and PsycInfo were searched for studies published between January 1995 and March 2011 reporting language functions in preterm-born children. Outcome measures were simple language function assessed by using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and complex language function assessed by using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals. Pooled effect sizes (in terms of Cohen's d) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for simple and complex language functions were calculated by using random-effects models. Meta-regression was conducted with mean difference of effect size as the outcome variable and assessment age as the explanatory variable. RESULTS: Preterm-born children scored significantly lower compared with term-born children on simple (d = -0.45 [95% CI: -0.59 to -0.30]; P < .001) and on complex (d = -0.62 [95% CI: -0.82 to -0.43]; P < .001) language function tests, even in the absence of major disabilities and independent of social economic status. For complex language function (but not for simple language function), group differences between preterm- and term-born children increased significantly from 3 to 12 years of age (slope = -0.05; P = .03).

Substantial growth in the prospective cohort study evidence base provides an opportunity to generate new and more detailed estimates of the magnitude of the effect. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to provide estimates of the prospective effect of smoking by parents or household members on the risk of wheeze and asthma at different stages of childhood. METHODS: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and conference abstracts to identify cohort studies of the incidence of asthma or wheeze in relation to exposure to prenatal or postnatal maternal, paternal, or household smoking in subjects aged up to 18 years old. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by using random effects model. RESULTS: We identified 79 prospective studies. Exposure to pre- or postnatal passive smoke exposure was associated with a 30% to 70% increased risk of incident wheezing (strongest effect from postnatal maternal smoking on wheeze in children aged </=2 years, OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.24-2.35, 4 studies) and a 21% to 85% increase in incident asthma (strongest effect from prenatal maternal smoking on asthma in children aged </=2 years, OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.35-2.53, 5 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Building upon previous findings, exposure to passive smoking increases the incidence of wheeze and asthma in children and young people by at least 20%.

However, its potential effects on COPD evolution have not been tested. We aimed to assess the association between dietary intake of cured meat and risk of COPD readmission in COPD patients. 274 COPD patients were recruited during their first COPD admission between 2004 and 2006, provided information on dietary intake of cured meat during the previous 2 yrs, and were followed until December 31, 2007 (median follow-up 2.6 yrs). Associations between cured meat intake and COPD admissions were assessed using parametric regression survival-time models. Mean +/- SD age was 68 +/- 8 yrs, 93% of patients were male, 42% were current smokers, mean post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) was 53 +/- 16% predicted, and median cured meat intake was 23 g . day(-1). After adjusting for age, FEV(1), and total caloric intake, high cured meat intake (more than median value) increased the risk of COPD readmission (adjusted HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.31-3.12; p=0.001).

DATA SOURCES: Two reviewers independently performed a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The search was limited to articles published in English, German, French, or Dutch. In addition, reference lists of the included articles were searched manually. DATA EXTRACTION: Studies describing vocal cord injury and/or hoarseness following short-term general anesthesia (<5 hours) using an endotracheal tube or any type of laryngeal mask were included. To obtain a reliable outcome regarding the occurrence of anesthesia-related laryngeal morbidity, only studies reporting both preoperative and postoperative measurements of vocal cord function were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 4119 articles were identified; of these, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. The studies were found to be heterogeneous and hardly comparable. Hoarseness and vocal cord injuries were common findings in most investigations. CONCLUSIONS: Hoarseness and vocal cord injuries are clinically relevant complications related to short-term general anesthesia using an endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask. However, more well-designed prospective studies are necessary to generate reliable data as well as to investigate techniques to reduce adverse laryngeal effects. For future research, a proposal to categorize the vocal cord lesions due to general anesthesia is presented.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether 4 wk of increased protein intake ( approximately 25% compared with approximately 15% of energy intake that isoenergetically replaces carbohydrate intake) lowers office and daytime BP compared with increased carbohydrate intake. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, parallel study compared consumption of 3 x 20 g protein/d (20% pea, 20% soy, 30% egg, and 30% milk-protein isolate) with 3 x 20 g maltodextrin/d. Protein or maltodextrin were isoenergetically substituted for a sugar-sweetened drink. Primary outcomes were office and daytime BP. A total of 99 men and women [age range: 20-70 y; BMI (in kg/m(2)): 25-35] with untreated elevated BP (BP >/=130/85 and <160/100 mm Hg) were randomly assigned. Ninety-four completers (51 subjects in the maltodextrin group, 43 subjects in the protein group) were included in the analyses. RESULTS: Office systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 4.9 +/- 1.7 mm Hg (P = 0.005) and 2.7 +/- 1.3 mm Hg (P = 0.05) lower, respectively, in the protein group.

STUDY DESIGN: We obtained data on the number of CSs performed in 137 countries in 2008. The consensus is that countries should achieve a 10% rate of CS; therefore, for countries that are below that rate, we calculated the cost to achieve a 10% rate. For countries with a CS rate of >15%, we calculated the savings that could be made by the achievement of a 15% rate. RESULTS: Fifty-four countries had CS rates of <10%, whereas 69 countries showed rates of >15%. The cost of the global saving by a reduction of CS rates to 15% was estimated to be $2.32 billion (US dollars); the cost to attain a 10% CS rate was $432 million (US dollars).

Thus, the California Department of Education began a series of steps to address the increase in obesity and decline in fitness in the 6.3 million public school children in California. We evaluated serial changes in obesity and fitness in California school children following implementation of prevention steps in all California public schools. METHODS: The California Department of Education implemented changes in school nutrition and exercise programs aimed at reducing obesity and improving fitness. Outcome results were monitored by performing Physical Fitness Testing on 8.4 million students (5th, 7th, and 9th grade) for body composition, aerobic capacity, flexibility, and upper body, abdominal, and truncal strength using the Cochran-Armitage trend test and multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Overall fitness improved from 2003 to 2008. Serial changes in body composition, aerobic capacity, flexibility, and upper body, abdominal, and truncal strength improved or remained stable within school as students progressed from 5th to 7th to 9th grade. However, students entering 5th grade were more obese every year, and this early obesity was not reversible within the school programs.

Warmer temperatures accelerate growth and reproduction of ectotherms, whereas these processes are slowed or halted in colder temperatures. Female blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus inhabiting the Chesapeake Bay, exhibit a seasonal migratory behavior that is closely tied with spawning and the release of larvae. To better understand reproductive activities of the migratory adult females, we examined two reproductive parameters of these crabs sampled monthly (April-December, 2006): the levels of vitellogenin (VtG) in the hemolymph and VtG expression in the hepatopancreas and ovary. The full-length cDNA of VtG (CasVtG-ova) has been isolated from the ovary. The putative CasVtG sequence found in the ovary is >99% identical to that of the hepatopancreas and is related most closely to the sequences reported in other crab species. In female C. sapidus, the hepatopancreas produces over 99% of the total VtG toward the ovarian development. Ovarian stages 2 and 3 in the sampled females are characterized by significant high levels of VtG in hemolymph and VtG expression in both the hepatopancreas and ovary. However, during the southbound migration in fall, females at ovarian stages 2 and 3 have decreased VtG levels, compared to those in spring and summer. The decreased vitellogenesis activity during the fall migration suggests seasonal adaptation to ensure successful spawning and the larval release.",Missing
22386036,Early appraisal of China's huge and complex health-care reforms.,Lancet,Yip WC and Hsiao WC and Chen W and Hu S and Ma J and Maynard A,Missing,"China's 3 year, CN yen850 billion (US$125 billion) reform plan, launched in 2009, marked the first phase towards achieving comprehensive universal health coverage by 2020. The government's undertaking of systemic reform and its affirmation of its role in financing health care together with priorities for prevention, primary care, and redistribution of finance and human resources to poor regions are positive developments. Accomplishing nearly universal insurance coverage in such a short time is commendable. However, transformation of money and insurance coverage into cost-effective services is difficult when delivery of health care is hindered by waste, inefficiencies, poor quality of services, and scarcity and maldistribution of the qualified workforce. China must reform its incentive structures for providers, improve governance of public hospitals, and institute a stronger regulatory system, but these changes have been slowed by opposition from stakeholders and lack of implementation capacity. The pace of reform should be moderated to allow service providers to develop absorptive capacity.

RESULTS: Between 1991-1993 and 1996-2008, the percentage of SIDS infants found prone decreased from 84.0% to 48.5% (P < .001), bed-sharing increased from 19.2% to 37.9% (P < .001), especially among infants <2 months (29.0% vs 63.8%), prematurity rate increased from 20.0% to 29.0% (P = .05), whereas symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection decreased from 46.6% to 24.8% (P < .001). Ninety-nine percent of SIDS infants had at least 1 risk factor, 57% had at least 2 extrinsic and 1 intrinsic risk factor, and only 5% had no extrinsic risk. The average number of risks per SIDS infant did not change after initiation of the BTS campaign. CONCLUSIONS: SIDS infants in the BTS era show more variation in risk factors. There was a consistently high prevalence of both intrinsic and especially extrinsic risks both before and during the Back-to-Sleep era. Risk reduction campaigns emphasizing the importance of avoiding multiple and simultaneous SIDS risks are essential to prevent SIDS, including among infants who may already be vulnerable.","Female *Health Promotion Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Mothers Prevalence *Prone Position Retrospective Studies Risk Factors *Sleep Sudden Infant Death/*epidemiology/etiology Tobacco Smoke Pollution/adverse effects United States/epidemiology"

Warmer temperatures accelerate growth and reproduction of ectotherms, whereas these processes are slowed or halted in colder temperatures. Female blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus inhabiting the Chesapeake Bay, exhibit a seasonal migratory behavior that is closely tied with spawning and the release of larvae. To better understand reproductive activities of the migratory adult females, we examined two reproductive parameters of these crabs sampled monthly (April-December, 2006): the levels of vitellogenin (VtG) in the hemolymph and VtG expression in the hepatopancreas and ovary. The full-length cDNA of VtG (CasVtG-ova) has been isolated from the ovary. The putative CasVtG sequence found in the ovary is >99% identical to that of the hepatopancreas and is related most closely to the sequences reported in other crab species. In female C. sapidus, the hepatopancreas produces over 99% of the total VtG toward the ovarian development. Ovarian stages 2 and 3 in the sampled females are characterized by significant high levels of VtG in hemolymph and VtG expression in both the hepatopancreas and ovary. However, during the southbound migration in fall, females at ovarian stages 2 and 3 have decreased VtG levels, compared to those in spring and summer. The decreased vitellogenesis activity during the fall migration suggests seasonal adaptation to ensure successful spawning and the larval release.",Missing

The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) collaborated to compare the rates of long-term survival after PCI and CABG. METHODS: We linked the ACCF National Cardiovascular Data Registry and the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database to claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the years 2004 through 2008. Outcomes were compared with the use of propensity scores and inverse-probability-weighting adjustment to reduce treatment-selection bias. RESULTS: Among patients 65 years of age or older who had two-vessel or three-vessel coronary artery disease without acute myocardial infarction, 86,244 underwent CABG and 103,549 underwent PCI. The median follow-up period was 2.67 years. At 1 year, there was no significant difference in adjusted mortality between the groups (6.24% in the CABG group as compared with 6.55% in the PCI group; risk ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.00). At 4 years, there was lower mortality with CABG than with PCI (16.4% vs. 20.8%; risk ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.82). Similar results were noted in multiple subgroups and with the use of several different analytic methods. Residual confounding was assessed by means of a sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study, we found that, among older patients with multivessel coronary disease that did not require emergency treatment, there was a long-term survival advantage among patients who underwent CABG as compared with patients who underwent PCI.

22451702,"The national Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program, 1994-2008.",Pediatrics,Smith EA and Jacques-Carroll L and Walker TY and Sirotkin B and Murphy TV,cdc,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the trends and outcomes of the national Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) for infants born from 1994 to 2008. METHODS: PHBPPs in state and city public health jurisdictions annually submitted program outcome reports to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The annual number of births to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive women was estimated and used to evaluate the percentage of PHBPP-identified HBsAg-positive pregnant women. PHBPP reports were used to assess program objectives achieved, and infant outcomes by 12 to 24 months of age. RESULTS: From 1994 to 2008, the estimated number of annual births to HBsAg-positive women increased from 19 208 to 25 600 (P < .001). The annual number of PHBPP-managed infants increased (P < .001), comprising 40.8% to 50.5% of the estimated number. On average, 94.4% of PHBPP-managed infants received hepatitis B immunoglobulin and hepatitis B vaccine within 1 day of birth. The percentage of infants who completed the vaccine series by age 12 months decreased from 86.0% to 77.7% (P = .004), but the percentage who received postvaccination testing increased from 25.1% to 56.0% (P < .001). Incidence of chronic hepatitis B virus infection among tested infants decreased from 2.1% in 1999 to 0.8% in 2008 (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The PHBPP achieved substantial progress in preventing perinatal hepatitis B virus infection in the United States, despite an increasing number of at-risk infants. Significant gaps remain in identifying HBsAg-positive pregnant women, and completing management and assessment of their infants to ensure prevention of perinatal hepatitis B virus transmission.","Female Hepatitis B/embryology/*prevention & control/transmission Humans Infant, Newborn Infant, Newborn, Diseases/epidemiology/prevention & control Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/epidemiology/*prevention & control United States/epidemiology Young Adult"

We therefore assessed the cause of death in 2001-03 in homes in small areas that were chosen to be representative of all the parts of India. METHODS: At least 130 trained physicians independently assigned causes to 122,429 deaths, which occurred in 1.1 million homes in 6671 small areas that were randomly selected to be representative of all of India, based on a structured non-medical surveyor's field report. FINDINGS: 7137 of 122,429 study deaths were due to cancer, corresponding to 556,400 national cancer deaths in India in 2010. 395,400 (71%) cancer deaths occurred in people aged 30-69 years (200,100 men and 195,300 women). At 30-69 years, the three most common fatal cancers were oral (including lip and pharynx, 45,800 [22.9%]), stomach (25,200 [12.6%]), and lung (including trachea and larynx, 22,900 [11.4%]) in men, and cervical (33,400 [17.1%]), stomach (27,500 [14.1%]), and breast (19,900 [10.2%]) in women. Tobacco-related cancers represented 42.0% (84,000) of male and 18.3% (35,700) of female cancer deaths and there were twice as many deaths from oral cancers as lung cancers. Age-standardised cancer mortality rates per 100,000 were similar in rural (men 95.6 [99% CI 89.6-101.7] and women 96.6 [90.7-102.6]) and urban areas (men 102.4 [92.7-112.1] and women 91.2 [81.9-100.5]), but varied greatly between the states, and were two times higher in the least educated than in the most educated adults (men, illiterate 106.6 [97.4-115.7] vs most educated 45.7 [37.8-53.6]; women, illiterate 106.7 [99.9-113.6] vs most educated 43.4 [30.7-56.1]). Cervical cancer was far less common in Muslim than in Hindu women (study deaths 24, age-standardised mortality ratio 0.68 [0.64-0.71] vs 340, 1.06 [1.05-1.08]). INTERPRETATION: Prevention of tobacco-related and cervical cancers and earlier detection of treatable cancers would reduce cancer deaths in India, particularly in the rural areas that are underserved by cancer services. The substantial variation in cancer rates in India suggests other risk factors or causative agents that remain to be discovered.

22405569,Oncologists' assessments of lung cancer patient and family disagreements regarding treatment decision making.,Lung Cancer,Siminoff LA and Dorflinger L and Agyemang A and Baker S and Wilson-Genderson M,vcu,"BACKGROUND: Disagreements between cancer patients and their caregivers about treatment and care can affect the patient's physical and mental well-being. Therefore it is important to understand if oncologists can accurately identify the presence of patient-caregiver decisional conflict. This study examined assessments made by lung cancer patients, their caregivers, and their oncologists regarding patient-caregiver disagreements concerning treatment and care decisions. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We assessed the extent to which the patient, caregiver, and oncologist reported disagreement between the patient and the family member regarding treatment decisions in 134 patient-caregiver-oncologist triads. Descriptive statistics were used to explore rates of concordance amongst all possible combinations of raters. Loglinear models were tested for 3-way agreement. RESULTS: Most patient-caregiver pairs, 82.1% (n = 110), reported agreement concerning presence or absence of decisional conflict. Oncologists were more successful in detecting absence of conflict than the presence of conflict. When the caregiver and the oncologist agreed, it was regarding the absence of conflict (64.9%), rather than the presence of conflict. In 10.6% (n = 15) of cases, oncologists reported that conflictual relationships negatively impacted their ability to provide patient care. CONCLUSIONS: Recent models of cancer patient care promote including the caregiver fully in the process while respecting the primacy of the patient's perspective. However, these models assume that the oncologist will recognize when disagreements exist and be able to assist in conflict resolution. The degree to which the oncologist identified that conflict exists and implications for their ability to provide patient care when familial disagreements existed are discussed.",Adult Aged Caregivers Decision Making *Dissent and Disputes Female Humans Linear Models Lung Neoplasms/*therapy Male Medical Oncology Middle Aged *Needs Assessment *Patient Preference *Physician's Role Professional-Patient Relations Questionnaires

22450213,Health insurance status change and emergency department use among US adults.,Arch Intern Med,Ginde AA and Lowe RA and Wiler JL,ucdenver,"BACKGROUND: Recent events have increased the instability of health insurance coverage. We compared emergency department (ED) use by newly insured vs continuously insured adults and by newly uninsured vs continuously uninsured adults. METHODS: We analyzed 159,934 adult respondents to the 2004 through 2009 National Health Interview Survey. Health insurance status was categorized as newly insured (currently insured but lacked health insurance at some point during the prior 12 months) vs continuously insured and as newly uninsured (currently uninsured but had health insurance at some point during the prior 12 months) vs continuously uninsured. We analyzed the number of ED visits during the prior 12 months using multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: Overall, 20.7% of insured adults and 20.0% of uninsured adults had at least 1 ED visit. However, 29.5% of newly insured adults compared with 20.2% of continuously insured adults had at least 1 ED visit. Similarly, 25.7% of newly uninsured adults compared with 18.6% of continuously uninsured adults had at least 1 ED visit. After adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, and health status, recent health insurance status change was independently associated with greater ED use for newly insured adults (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.22-1.42 vs continuously insured adults) and for newly uninsured adults (IRR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.26-1.54 vs continuously uninsured adults). Among newly insured adults, this association was strongest for Medicaid beneficiaries (IRR, 1.45) but was attenuated for those with private insurance (IRR, 1.24) (P < .001 for interaction). CONCLUSIONS: Recent changes in health insurance status for newly insured adults and for newly uninsured adults were associated with greater ED use. As policy and economic forces create disruptions in health insurance status, new surges in ED use should be anticipated.","Adult Aged Ambulatory Care/economics/utilization Continuity of Patient Care Emergency Service, Hospital/*economics/*utilization Female Health Care Surveys *Health Services Accessibility/economics Humans *Insurance Coverage/statistics & numerical data *Insurance, Health/statistics & numerical data Male Medicaid Medically Uninsured/*statistics & numerical data Medicare Middle Aged Questionnaires United States/epidemiology"

This year's report highlights the increased cancer risk associated with excess weight (overweight or obesity) and lack of sufficient physical activity (<150 minutes of physical activity per week). METHODS: Data on cancer incidence were obtained from the CDC, NCI, and NAACCR; data on cancer deaths were obtained from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Annual percent changes in incidence and death rates (age-standardized to the 2000 US population) for all cancers combined and for the leading cancers among men and among women were estimated by joinpoint analysis of long-term trends (incidence for 1992-2008 and mortality for 1975-2008) and short-term trends (1999-2008). Information was obtained from national surveys about the proportion of US children, adolescents, and adults who are overweight, obese, insufficiently physically active, or physically inactive. RESULTS: Death rates from all cancers combined decreased from 1999 to 2008, continuing a decline that began in the early 1990s, among men and among women in most racial and ethnic groups. Death rates decreased from 1999 to 2008 for most cancer sites, including the 4 most common cancers (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate). The incidence of prostate and colorectal cancers also decreased from 1999 to 2008. Lung cancer incidence declined from 1999 to 2008 among men and from 2004 to 2008 among women. Breast cancer incidence decreased from 1999 to 2004 but was stable from 2004 to 2008. Incidence increased for several cancers, including pancreas, kidney, and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, which are associated with excess weight. CONCLUSIONS: Although improvements are reported in the US cancer burden, excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity contribute to the increased incidence of many cancers, adversely affect quality of life for cancer survivors, and may worsen prognosis for several cancers. The current report highlights the importance of efforts to promote healthy weight and sufficient physical activity in reducing the cancer burden in the United States.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over *Annual Reports as Topic Child Child, Preschool *Exercise Female Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Male Middle Aged Mortality/trends Neoplasms/*epidemiology/ethnology/mortality/prevention & control *Overweight United States/epidemiology"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether dense cranial electroacupuncture stimulation (DCEAS) could enhance the antidepressant efficacy in the early phase of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: In this single-blind, randomized, controlled study, patients with MDD were randomly assigned to 9-session DCEAS or noninvasive electroacupuncture (n-EA) control procedure in combination with fluoxetine (FLX) for 3 weeks. Clinical outcomes were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), Clinical Global Impression-severity (CGI-S), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) as well as the response and remission rates. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were randomly assigned to n-EA (n = 35) and DCEAS (n = 38), of whom 34 in n-EA and 36 in DCEAS group were analyzed. DCEAS-treated patients displayed a significantly greater reduction from baseline in HAMD-17 scores at Day 3 through Day 21 and in SDS scores at Day 3 and Day 21 compared to patients receiving n-EA. DCEAS intervention also produced a higher rate of clinically significant response compared to n-EA procedure (19.4% (7/36) vs. 8.8% (3/34)). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: DCEAS is a safe and effective intervention that augments the antidepressant efficacy. It can be considered as an additional therapy in the early phase of SSRI treatment of depressed patients.

22455751,The long-term effect of premier pay for performance on patient outcomes.,N Engl J Med,Jha AK and Joynt KE and Orav EJ and Epstein AM,harvard,"BACKGROUND: Pay for performance has become a central strategy in the drive to improve health care. We assessed the long-term effect of the Medicare Premier Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration (HQID) on patient outcomes. METHODS: We used Medicare data to compare outcomes between the 252 hospitals participating in the Premier HQID and 3363 control hospitals participating in public reporting alone. We examined 30-day mortality among more than 6 million patients who had acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or pneumonia or who underwent coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) between 2003 and 2009. RESULTS: At baseline, the composite 30-day mortality was similar for Premier and non-Premier hospitals (12.33% and 12.40%, respectively; difference, -0.07 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.40 to 0.26). The rates of decline in mortality per quarter at the two types of hospitals were also similar (0.04% and 0.04%, respectively; difference, -0.01 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.01), and mortality remained similar after 6 years under the pay-for-performance system (11.82% for Premier hospitals and 11.74% for non-Premier hospitals; difference, 0.08 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.30 to 0.46). We found that the effects of pay for performance on mortality did not differ significantly among conditions for which outcomes were explicitly linked to incentives (acute myocardial infarction and CABG) and among conditions not linked to incentives (congestive heart failure and pneumonia) (P=0.36 for interaction). Among hospitals that were poor performers at baseline, mortality was similar in the two groups of hospitals at the start of the study (15.12% and 14.73%; difference, 0.39 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.36 to 1.15), with similar rates of improvement per quarter (0.10% and 0.07%; difference, -0.03 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.02) and similar mortality rates at the end of the study (13.37% and 13.21%; difference, 0.15 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.70 to 1.01). CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that the largest hospital-based pay-for-performance program led to a decrease in 30-day mortality. Expectations of improved outcomes for programs modeled after Premier HQID should therefore remain modest.","Coronary Artery Bypass Economics, Hospital Heart Failure/mortality *Hospital Mortality/trends Hospitals/*standards Humans Medicare Myocardial Infarction/mortality Pneumonia/mortality *Quality Assurance, Health Care *Reimbursement, Incentive Treatment Outcome United States"

This study aimed to determine the independent relationship of sitting time with all-cause mortality. METHODS: We linked prospective questionnaire data from 222 497 individuals 45 years or older from the 45 and Up Study to mortality data from the New South Wales Registry of Births, Deaths, and Marriages (Australia) from February 1, 2006, through December 31, 2010. Cox proportional hazards models examined all-cause mortality in relation to sitting time, adjusting for potential confounders that included sex, age, education, urban/rural residence, physical activity, body mass index, smoking status, self-rated health, and disability. RESULTS: During 621 695 person-years of follow-up (mean follow-up, 2.8 years), 5405 deaths were registered. All-cause mortality hazard ratios were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.95-1.09), 1.15 (1.06-1.25), and 1.40 (1.27-1.55) for 4 to less than 8, 8 to less than 11, and 11 or more h/d of sitting, respectively, compared with less than 4 h/d, adjusting for physical activity and other confounders. The population-attributable fraction for sitting was 6.9%. The association between sitting and all-cause mortality appeared consistent across the sexes, age groups, body mass index categories, and physical activity levels and across healthy participants compared with participants with preexisting cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged sitting is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, independent of physical activity. Public health programs should focus on reducing sitting time in addition to increasing physical activity levels.",Aged Cause of Death Female Humans Male Middle Aged *Mortality New South Wales/epidemiology Prospective Studies Risk Factors *Sedentary Lifestyle Time Factors
22404952,Postpartum depression and intimate partner violence in urban mothers: co-occurrence and child healthcare utilization.,J Pediatr,Kornfeld BD and Bair-Merritt MH and Frosch E and Solomon BS,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence, timing, and co-occurrence of positive screens for maternal postpartum depression and intimate partner violence and examine their relationships with children's healthcare utilization from birth to 2 years. STUDY DESIGN: Between February and March 2008, mothers bringing newborn, 2-, 4-, or 6-month-old children to an urban primary care clinic were screened for postpartum depression and intimate partner violence. A retrospective chart review abstracted demographic data, maternal responses on the postpartum depression/intimate partner violence screen at the initial and subsequent visits, and, from the child's birth to second birthday, adherence with well-child care and use of pediatric acute care and emergency department visits. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 173 mothers completed at least one postpartum depression/intimate partner violence screening survey. Overall, 26% screened positive for postpartum depression and 7% screened positive for intimate partner violence; most positive screens occurred at the initial visit. About 60% of mothers with a positive intimate partner violence screen also had a positive postpartum depression screen. Well-child care adherence and acute care visit utilization were not associated with maternal postpartum depression/intimate partner violence screening. Children of women with a positive screen for postpartum depression had greater emergency department utilization. CONCLUSION: The co-occurrence of postpartum depression and intimate partner violence is high in urban mothers. Primary care providers should routinely screen for both problems in this population and recognize the importance of screening for one problem if the other problem is identified.","Adult Child Health Services/*utilization Depression, Postpartum/*complications/diagnosis Female Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Socioeconomic Factors *Spouse Abuse *Urban Population Young Adult"
22425103,Impact of nutritional factors on incident kidney stone formation: a report from the WHI OS.,J Urol,Sorensen MD and Kahn AJ and Reiner AP and Tseng TY and Shikany JM and Wallace RB and Chi T and Wactawski-Wende J and Jackson RD and O'Sullivan MJ and Sadetsky N and Stoller ML,uw,"PURPOSE: Increased fluid intake, and decreased dietary sodium and animal protein intake are thought to reduce the risk of kidney stones but the role of calcium intake is controversial. We evaluated the relationship between dietary factors and incident kidney stone formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Secondary analysis was done of 78,293 women from the prospective WHI OS (Women's Health Initiative Observational Study) with no history of nephrolithiasis who completed the validated food frequency questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine demographic and dietary factors, and supplement use independently associated with incident kidney stones. RESULTS: Overall 1,952 women (2.5%) reported an incident kidney stone in 573,575 person-years of followup. The risk of incident kidney stones was decreased by 5% to 28% (p = 0.01) with higher dietary calcium intake and by 13% to 31% (p = 0.002) with higher water intake after adjusting for nephrolithiasis risk factors. Conversely higher dietary sodium intake increased the risk of nephrolithiasis by 11% to 61% (p <0.001) after adjustment with the most pronounced effect in women with the highest intake. Higher body mass index independently increased the risk of incident nephrolithiasis (adjusted OR 1.19-2.01, p <0.001). Animal protein intake was not associated with nephrolithiasis on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the growing evidence underscoring the importance of maintaining adequate fluid and dietary calcium intake. Greater dietary calcium intake significantly decreased the risk of incident kidney stones. In contrast, excess sodium intake increased the risk of incident nephrolithiasis, especially in women with the highest intake. Animal protein intake was not independently associated with nephrolithiasis.","Aged Body Mass Index Calcium, Dietary/*administration & dosage Drinking Water/administration & dosage Female Humans Kidney Calculi/*epidemiology/prevention & control Logistic Models Middle Aged Questionnaires Risk Factors Sodium, Dietary/*administration & dosage"

We linked questionnaire data from the Million Women Study with hospital admission and death records to examine the risk of VTE in relation to body mass index (BMI) both in the absence of surgery and in the first 12 weeks following an operation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Overall, 1 170 495 women (mean age, 56.1 years) recruited in 1996 to 2001 through the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme in England and Scotland were followed for an average of 6 years, during which time 6438 were admitted to hospital or died of VTE. The adjusted relative risks of VTE increased progressively with increasing BMI and women with a BMI >/= 35 kg/m(2) were 3-4 times as likely to develop VTE as those with a BMI 22.5 to 24.9 (relative risk 3.45 [95% CI 3.09-3.86]). Overweight and obese women were more likely than lean women to be admitted for surgery and also to develop postoperative VTE. During a 12-week period without surgery, the incidence rates of VTE per 1000 women with a BMI < 25 and >/= 25 were 0.10 (0.09-0.10) and 0.19 (0.18-0.20); the corresponding rates in the 12 weeks following day and inpatient surgery were, respectively, about 4 and 40 times higher.

RESULTS: After adjusting for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, renal disease, coronary heart disease, obesity, and alcohol abuse/alcohol dependence syndrome, conditional logistic regression revealed that among ED patients the odds of having been previously diagnosed with migraines was 1.63 (95% CI, 1.39-1.91) that of the control group. This risk was more pronounced in younger groups, with the highest risk being detected among those aged between 30 and 39 years. After adjusting for the above mentioned comorbidities, ED patients aged between 30 and 39 years were found to be at 1.98 (95% CI, 1.67-2.23) times the risk of controls for having been previously diagnosed with migraines. CONCLUSION: We conclude that ED is associated with having been previously diagnosed with migraines, particularly in younger populations.","Adult Age Distribution Aged Aged, 80 and over Case-Control Studies Comorbidity Erectile Dysfunction/*diagnosis/*epidemiology Evidence-Based Medicine Humans Male Middle Aged Migraine Disorders/*diagnosis/*epidemiology Prevalence Recurrence Risk Assessment Risk Factors Taiwan/epidemiology"
22542117,Changes in labor patterns over 50 years.,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Laughon SK and Branch DW and Beaver J and Zhang J,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine differences in labor patterns in a modern cohort compared with the 1960s in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: Data from pregnancies at term, in spontaneous labor, with cephalic, singleton fetuses were compared between the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP, n = 39,491 delivering 1959-1966) and the Consortium on Safe Labor (CSL; n = 98,359 delivering 2002-2008). RESULTS: Compared with the CPP, women in the CSL were older (26.8 +/- 6.0 vs 24.1 +/- 6.0 years), heavier (body mass index 29.9 +/- 5.0 vs 26.3 +/- 4.1 kg/m(2)), had higher epidural (55% vs 4%) and oxytocin use (31% vs 12%), and cesarean delivery (12% vs 3%). First stage of labor in the CSL was longer by a median of 2.6 hours in nulliparas and 2.0 hours in multiparas, even after adjusting for maternal and pregnancy characteristics, suggesting that the prolonged labor is mostly due to changes in practice patterns. CONCLUSION: Labor is longer in the modern obstetrical cohort. The benefit of extensive interventions needs further evaluation.","Adult Age Factors Body Mass Index Delivery, Obstetric/methods/statistics & numerical data/*trends Female Humans Labor Stage, First Labor Stage, Second Labor, Obstetric/*physiology Linear Models Multivariate Analysis Parity Physician's Practice Patterns Pregnancy Pregnancy Outcome Retrospective Studies Time Factors United States"
22357724,Infant regulation of intake: the effect of free glutamate content in infant formulas.,Am J Clin Nutr,Ventura AK and Beauchamp GK and Mennella JA,Missing,"BACKGROUND: We recently discovered that infants randomly assigned to a formula high in free amino acids (extensive protein hydrolysate formula; ePHF) during infancy consumed less formula to satiation and gained less weight than did infants fed an isocaloric formula low in free amino acids (cow milk formula; CMF). OBJECTIVE: Because ePHF and CMF differ markedly in concentrations of free glutamate, we tested the hypothesis that the higher glutamate concentrations in ePHF promote satiation and satiety. DESIGN: In this counterbalanced, within-subject study, infants <4 mo of age (n = 30) visited our laboratory for 3 sets of 2 consecutive infant-led formula meals over 3 test days. Infants were fed 1 of 3 isocaloric formulas during each first meal: CMF, ePHF, or CMF with added free glutamate to approximate concentrations in ePHF (CMF+glu). When infants signaled hunger again, they were fed a second meal of CMF. From these data, we calculated satiety ratios for each of the 3 formulas by dividing the intermeal interval by the amount of formula consumed during that particular first meal. RESULTS: Infants consumed significantly less CMF+glu (P < 0.02) and ePHF (P < 0.04) than CMF during the first meals. They also showed greater levels of satiety after consuming CMF+glu or ePHF: satiety ratios for CMF+glu (P < 0.03) and ePHF (P < 0.05) were significantly higher than for CMF. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a role of free glutamate in infant intake regulation and call into question the claim that formula feeding impairs infants' abilities to self regulate energy intake.",Adult *Appetite Regulation Cross-Over Studies Energy Intake Feeding Methods/adverse effects Female Glutamic Acid/*administration & dosage/analysis Humans Infant Infant Behavior Infant Formula/*chemistry Male Parents Philadelphia Protein Hydrolysates/chemistry Satiety Response Single-Blind Method Taste Weight Gain Young Adult

OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence, age at onset, and sociodemographic correlates of alcohol and illicit drug use and abuse among US adolescents. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of adolescents using a modified version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. SETTING: Combined household and school adolescent samples. PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative sample of 10,123 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime estimates of alcohol and illicit substance use and DSM-IV diagnoses of abuse, with or without dependence. RESULTS: By late adolescence, 78.2% of US adolescents had consumed alcohol, 47.1% had reached regular drinking levels defined by at least 12 drinks within a given year, and 15.1% met criteria for lifetime abuse. The opportunity to use illicit drugs was reported by 81.4% of the oldest adolescents, drug use by 42.5%, and drug abuse by 16.4%. The median age at onset was 14 years for alcohol abuse with or without dependence, 14 years for drug abuse with dependence, and 15 years for drug abuse without dependence. The associations observed by age, sex, and race/ethnicity often varied significantly by previous stage of use. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol and drug use is common in US adolescents, and the findings of this study indicate that most cases of abuse have their initial onset in this important period of development.

22425732,The impact of a step stool on cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a cross-over mannequin study.,Resuscitation,Edelson DP and Call SL and Yuen TC and Vanden Hoek TL,uchicago,"OBJECTIVE: Shallow chest compressions and incomplete recoil are common during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and negatively affect outcomes. A step stool has the potential to alter these parameters when performing CPR in a bed but the impact has not been quantified. METHODS: We conducted a cross-over design, simulated study of in-hospital cardiac arrest. Rescuers performed a total of four 2-min segments of uninterrupted chest compressions, half of which were on a step stool. Compression characteristics were measured using a CPR-sensing defibrillator and subjective impressions were obtained from rescuer surveys. Paired analyses were performed to measure the impact of the step stool, taking into account rescuer characteristics, including height. RESULTS: Fifty subjects, of whom 36% were men, with a median height of 169.8 cm (range 148.6-190.5) volunteered to participate. Use of a step stool resulted in an average increase in compression depth of 4 mm (p<0.001) and 18% increase in incomplete recoil (p<0.001). However, unlike with incomplete recoil, the effect was more pronounced in rescuers in the lowest height tertile (9+/-9 mm vs 2+/-6 mm for those rescuers taller than 167 cm, p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Using a step stool when performing CPR in a bed results in a trade-off between increased compression depth and increased incomplete recoil. Given the nonlinear relationship between the increase in compression depth and rescuer height, the benefit of a step stool may outweigh the risks of incomplete release for rescuers </=167 cm in height. The benefit is less clear in taller rescuers.",Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/education/*methods Cross-Over Studies Defibrillators Female Heart Arrest/*therapy Humans Male *Manikins Prospective Studies
22423127,Unexpectedly limited durability of immunity following acellular pertussis vaccination in preadolescents in a North American outbreak.,Clin Infect Dis,Witt MA and Katz PH and Witt DJ,kp,"BACKGROUND: Despite widespread childhood vaccination against Bordetella pertussis, disease remains prevalent. It has been suggested that acellular vaccine may be less effective than previously believed. During a large outbreak, we examined the incidence of pertussis and effectiveness of vaccination in a well-vaccinated, well-defined community. METHODS: Our center provides care to 135 000 patients, 40% of the population of Marin County, California. A total of 171 patients tested positive for B. pertussis from 1 March to 31 October 2010 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Electronic medical records were reviewed for demographic characteristics and vaccination status. RESULTS: We identified 171 cases of clinical pertussis, 132 of which were in pediatric patients. There was a notable increase in cases among patients aged 8-12 years. The rate of testing peaked among infants but remained relatively constant across ages until 12 years. The rate of positive tests was low for ages 0-6 years and increased among preadolescents, peaking among those aged 12 years. The vaccination rate among PCR-positive preadolescents were approximately equal to that of controls. The vaccine effectiveness was 41%, 24%, and 79% for children aged 2-7 years, 8-12 years, 13-18 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that the current schedule of acellular pertussis vaccine doses is insufficient to prevent outbreaks of pertussis. We noted a markedly increased rate of disease from ages 8-12 years, proportionate to the interval since the last scheduled vaccine. Stable rates of testing ruled out selection bias. The possibility of earlier or more numerous booster doses of acellular pertussis vaccine either as part of routine immunization or for outbreak control should be entertained.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Bordetella pertussis/immunology/isolation & purification California/epidemiology Child Child, Preschool *Disease Outbreaks Female Humans Incidence Infant Male Middle Aged Pertussis Vaccine/*administration & dosage/*immunology Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods Time Factors Vaccines, Acellular/administration & dosage/immunology Whooping Cough/*epidemiology/*prevention & control Young Adult"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Study cohort included 603,416 diabetic patients and 472,188 nondiabetic control subjects. Incidence rate and relative risk of PD (ICD-9-CM 332.0) were evaluated. RESULTS: The incidence of PD was 3.59 and 2.15 per 10,000 person-years for the diabetic and control group, respectively, representing a covariate adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.61 (95% CI 1.56-1.66), which was substantially reduced to 1.37 (1.32-1.41) after adjusting for medical visits. Diabetes was associated with a significantly elevated risk of PD in all sex and age stratifications except in young women, with the highest HR noted for young men aged 21-40 years (2.10 [1.01-4.42]), followed by women aged 41-60 (2.05 [1.82-2.30]) and >60 years (1.65 [1.58-1.73]).

22416998,The prevalence and natural history of urinary symptoms among recreational ketamine users.,BJU Int,Winstock AR and Mitcheson L and Gillatt DA and Cottrell AM,Missing,"Study Type--Symptom prevalence (prospective cohort) Level of Evidence 1b. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Case series have described lower urinary tract symptoms associated with ketamine use including severe pain, frequency, haematuria and dysuria. Little is known regarding the frequency of symptoms, relationship of symptoms with dose and frequency of use and natural history of symptoms once the ketamine user has stopped. This study describes the prevalence of ketamine use in a population of recreational drug users in a dance music setting. It shows a dose-frequency relationship with ketamine use. It shows that urinary symptoms associated with recreational ketamine use may lead to a considerable demand on health resources in the primary-, secondary- and emergency-care settings. It shows that symptoms may improve once ketamine use is decreased. OBJECTIVE: * To investigate the prevalence and natural history of urinary symptoms in a cohort of recreational ketamine users. PATIENTS AND METHODS: * A purposeful sampling technique was used. * Between November 2009 and January 2010 participants were invited to undertake an on-line questionnaire promoted by a national dance music magazine and website. * Data regarding demographics and illicit drug-use were collected. * Among respondents reporting recent ketamine use, additional information detailing their ketamine use, experience of urinary symptoms and use of related healthcare services was obtained. RESULTS: * In all, 3806 surveys were completed, of which 1285 (33.8%) participants reported ketamine use within the last year. * Of the ketamine users, 17% were found to be dependent on the drug; 26.6% (340) of recent ketamine users reported experiencing urinary symptoms. * Urinary symptoms were significantly related to both dose of ketamine used and frequency of ketamine use. * Of 251 users reporting their experience of symptoms over time in relationship to their use of ketamine, 51% reported improvement in urinary symptoms upon cessation of use with only eight (3.8%) reporting deterioration after stopping use. CONCLUSIONS: * Urinary tract symptoms are reported in over a quarter of regular ketamine users. * A dose and frequency response relationship has been shown between ketamine use and urinary symptoms. * Both users and primary-care providers need to be educated about urinary symptoms that may arise in ketamine users. A multi-disciplinary approach promoting harm reduction, cessation and early referral is needed to manage individuals with ketamine-associated urinary tract symptoms to avoid progression to severe and irreversible urological pathologies.","Abdominal Pain/chemically induced/epidemiology Adult Anesthetics, Dissociative/*adverse effects Cohort Studies Cystitis/chemically induced/epidemiology Female Great Britain/epidemiology Humans Ketamine/*adverse effects Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms/*chemically induced/epidemiology Male Prevalence Street Drugs/*adverse effects United States/epidemiology"

To identify further genetic risk factors, here we assess the role of de novo mutations in ASD by sequencing the exomes of ASD cases and their parents (n = 175 trios). Fewer than half of the cases (46.3%) carry a missense or nonsense de novo variant, and the overall rate of mutation is only modestly higher than the expected rate. In contrast, the proteins encoded by genes that harboured de novo missense or nonsense mutations showed a higher degree of connectivity among themselves and to previous ASD genes as indexed by protein-protein interaction screens. The small increase in the rate of de novo events, when taken together with the protein interaction results, are consistent with an important but limited role for de novo point mutations in ASD, similar to that documented for de novo copy number variants. Genetic models incorporating these data indicate that most of the observed de novo events are unconnected to ASD; those that do confer risk are distributed across many genes and are incompletely penetrant (that is, not necessarily sufficient for disease). Our results support polygenic models in which spontaneous coding mutations in any of a large number of genes increases risk by 5- to 20-fold. Despite the challenge posed by such models, results from de novo events and a large parallel case-control study provide strong evidence in favour of CHD8 and KATNAL2 as genuine autism risk factors.","Autistic Disorder/*genetics Case-Control Studies DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics Exome/genetics Exons/*genetics Family Health Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics Humans Models, Genetic Multifactorial Inheritance/genetics Mutation/*genetics Phenotype Poisson Distribution Protein Interaction Maps Transcription Factors/*genetics"
22427679,Genital warts and risk of cancer: a Danish study of nearly 50 000 patients with genital warts.,J Infect Dis,Blomberg M and Friis S and Munk C and Bautz A and Kjaer SK,Missing,"BACKGROUND: We conducted a large national cohort study to examine the risk of cancer among men and women with genital warts (GW). METHODS: By use of the Danish National Patient Register, we identified 16,155 men and 32,933 women who received a diagnosis of GW during 1978-2008. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were computed as estimates of the relative risk of specific cancers or sites. RESULTS: A diagnosis of GW was strongly related to anal (SIR for men, 21.5; SIR for women, 7.8), vulvar (SIR, 14.8), vaginal (SIR, 5.9), cervical (SIR, 1.5), penile (SIR, 8.2), and head and neck cancer (SIR, 2.8), including subsites of head and neck cancer with confirmed HPV association (SIR for men, 3.5; SIR for women, 4.8). The risks remained elevated for >10 years following GW diagnosis. In addition, we found moderately increased SIR estimates for nonmelanoma skin cancer, smoking-related cancers, and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with GW have a long-term increased risk of anogenital cancers and head and neck cancers. The elevated risks of nonmelanoma skin cancers might indicate an association with HPV, while excess risks of other cancers could point to differences in other risk factors between individuals with GW and the general population.","Adult Alphapapillomavirus/*physiology Anus Neoplasms/epidemiology/*virology Cohort Studies Condylomata Acuminata/*complications/virology Denmark/epidemiology Female Follow-Up Studies Genital Neoplasms, Female/epidemiology/virology Genital Neoplasms, Male/epidemiology/virology Head and Neck Neoplasms/epidemiology/*virology Humans Incidence Lymphoma/epidemiology/virology Male Neoplasms Papillomavirus Vaccines/immunology Registries Risk Factors Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology/*virology Urogenital Neoplasms/epidemiology/*virology Young Adult"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two consecutive population-based surveys for type 2 diabetes were conducted in randomly selected adults aged 35-74 years in Shanghai in 2002-2003 (n = 12,329) and in 2009 (n = 7,423). Diagnosed type 2 diabetes was determined based on self-report, whereas those undiagnosed were identified by measured fasting and postload glucose according to 2009 American Diabetes Association criteria. RESULTS: Age-standardized prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed type 2 diabetes increased from 5.1 and 4.6% in 2002-2003 to 7.4 and 5.2% in 2009. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes increased with age and was higher among men and in urban residents in both surveys (P < 0.001). Between the two surveys, the increase in the prevalence was more evident in the rural population (P < 0.001) and appeared more rapid in younger birth cohorts (P < 0.05).

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation may contribute to the development of BPH and LUTS. Therefore, it is plausible that anti-inflammatory agents, such as aspirin and other NSAIDs, may reduce the risk of BPH/LUTS, as was observed in a recent analysis of daily aspirin use and BPH/LUTS risk in the Olmsted County Study of Urinary Symptoms and Health Status in Men. The present study, conducted in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, found no association for recent aspirin or ibuprofen use with the risk of BPH/LUTS. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use and the incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related outcomes and nocturia, a lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) of BPH, in light of accumulating evidence suggesting a role for inflammation in BPH/LUTS development. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At baseline, participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial completed questions on recent, regular aspirin and ibuprofen use, BPH surgery, diagnosis of an enlarged prostate/BPH, and nocturia. Participants in the intervention arm also underwent a digital rectal examination (DRE), from which prostate dimensions were estimated, as well as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. Only participants in the intervention arm without BPH/LUTS at baseline were included in the analysis (n= 4771). * During follow-up, participants underwent annual DREs and PSA tests, provided annual information on finasteride use, and completed a supplemental questionnaire in 2006-2008 that included additional questions on diagnosis of an enlarged prostate/BPH and nocturia. * Information collected was used to investigate regular aspirin or ibuprofen use in relation to the incidence of six BPH/LUTS definitions: diagnosis of an enlarged prostate/BPH, nocturia (waking two or more times per night to urinate), finasteride use, any self-reported BPH/LUTS, prostate enlargement (estimated prostate volume >/=30 mL on any follow-up DRE) and elevation in PSA level (>1.4 ng/mL on any follow-up PSA test). RESULTS: Generally, null results were observed for any recent, regular aspirin or ibuprofen use (risk ratio = 0.92-1.21, P= 0.043-0.91) and frequency of use (risk ratios for one category increase in NSAID use = 0.98-1.11, P-trends = 0.10-0.99) with incident BPH/LUTS. CONCLUSION: The findings obtained in the present study do not support a protective role for recent NSAID use in BPH/LUTS development.","Aged Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*therapeutic use Aspirin/*therapeutic use Digital Rectal Examination Follow-Up Studies Humans Ibuprofen/*therapeutic use Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms/*prevention & control Male Middle Aged Prognosis Prostate-Specific Antigen/blood Prostatic Hyperplasia/blood/*prevention & control Risk Factors"

METHODS: We conducted a prospective consecutive cohort study in the emergency department of a pediatric hospital from July 31, 2009 to April 30, 2011. All children aged between 1 and 36 months for whom a urine culture was prescribed for suspected UTI (ie, unexplained fever, irritability, or vomiting) were assessed for eligibility. A standardized questionnaire was administered to the parents by a research assistant. The primary outcome measure was a UTI. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-six children were initially enrolled, but 65 were excluded a posteriori either because a urine culture, although prescribed, was not done (11), was collected by bag (39), and/or showed gross contamination (25). Therefore, 331 children were included in the final analysis. Their median age was 12 months (range, 1-36). Criteria for UTI were fulfilled in 51 (15%). A malodorous urine was reported by parents in 57% of children with UTI and in 32% of children without UTI. On logistic regression, malodorous urine was associated with UTI (odds ratio 2.83, 95% confidence interval: 1.54-5.20). This association remained statistically significant when adjusted for gender and the presence of vesicoureteral reflux (odds ratio 2.73, 95% confidence interval: 1.46-5.08). CONCLUSIONS: Parental reporting of malodorous urine increases the probability of UTI among young children being evaluated for suspected UTI. However, this association is not strong enough to definitely rule in or out a diagnosis of UTI.","Age Factors Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Confidence Intervals Female Humans Infant Male Odds Ratio Odors Predictive Value of Tests Prospective Studies *Questionnaires Urinary Tract Infections/*diagnosis Urine/*physiology"

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Internet-based observational study of Danish women who were planning a pregnancy (2007-2009). PATIENT(S): A total of 3,628 women aged 18-40 years at baseline. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Time to pregnancy (TTP). Fecundability ratios (FRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from discrete-time Cox models, with adjustment for potential confounders, such as body mass index (BMI). RESULT(S): We observed an inverse monotonic association between vigorous PA and fecundability (>/= 5 h/wk vs. none: FR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54-0.85) and a weak positive association between moderate PA and fecundability (>/= 5 vs. <1 h/wk: FR 1.18, 95% CI 0.98-1.43) after mutual adjustment for both PA types. Inverse associations between high vigorous PA and fecundability were observed within subgroups of age, parity status, and cycle regularity, but not among overweight or obese women (BMI >/= 25 kg/m(2)). CONCLUSION(S): There was evidence for a dose-response relationship between increasing vigorous PA and delayed TTP in all subgroups of women with the exception of overweight and obese women. Moderate PA was associated with a small increase in fecundability regardless of BMI. These findings indicate that PA of any type might improve fertility among overweight and obese women, a subgroup at higher risk of infertility.

A concerted international effort is underway to contain artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, but containment strategies are dependent on whether resistance has emerged elsewhere. We aimed to establish whether artemisinin resistance has spread or emerged on the Thailand-Myanmar (Burma) border. METHODS: In malaria clinics located along the northwestern border of Thailand, we measured six hourly parasite counts in patients with uncomplicated hyperparasitaemic falciparum malaria (>/=4% infected red blood cells) who had been given various oral artesunate-containing regimens since 2001. Parasite clearance half-lives were estimated and parasites were genotyped for 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms. FINDINGS: 3202 patients were studied between 2001 and 2010. Parasite clearance half-lives lengthened from a geometric mean of 2.6 h (95% CI 2.5-2.7) in 2001, to 3.7 h (3.6-3.8) in 2010, compared with a mean of 5.5 h (5.2-5.9) in 119 patients in western Cambodia measured between 2007 and 2010. The proportion of slow-clearing infections (half-life >/=6.2 h) increased from 0.6% in 2001, to 20% in 2010, compared with 42% in western Cambodia between 2007 and 2010. Of 1583 infections genotyped, 148 multilocus parasite genotypes were identified, each of which infected between two and 13 patients. The proportion of variation in parasite clearance attributable to parasite genetics increased from 30% between 2001 and 2004, to 66% between 2007 and 2010. INTERPRETATION: Genetically determined artemisinin resistance in P falciparum emerged along the Thailand-Myanmar border at least 8 years ago and has since increased substantially. At this rate of increase, resistance will reach rates reported in western Cambodia in 2-6 years.

The aim of the current study was to examine whether the association between motor coordination and emotional functioning is mediated by self-perceptions in a normative sample of adolescents. METHODS: Participants included 93 adolescents aged 12 to 16 years. The Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 provided 2 indicators of motor coordination; the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and Spence Children's Anxiety Scale provided 2 indicators of emotional functioning; and the Self-Description Questionnaire--II provided 6 indicators for self-perceived competence. RESULTS: Structural equation modeling revealed that motor coordination affects emotional functioning via self-perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the relationship between motor coordination and emotional functioning in adolescents from a normative sample may be understood in terms of a mechanism by which motor coordination has an indirect impact on emotional outcomes through various self-perception domains. These findings have important implications for increasing awareness and developing appropriate treatment programs for motor coordination and emotional difficulties.",Adolescent Child Emotions/*physiology Female Humans Male Performance Anxiety/physiopathology/psychology Psychometrics/*methods Psychomotor Performance/*physiology Questionnaires Reference Values *Self Concept

However, female recreational skiers have twice the knee injury incidence of male skiers, and the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk is 3 times greater in female skiers. PURPOSE: To evaluate whether leg dominance is a risk factor for noncontact ACL injuries in female recreational skiers. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The relationships between leg dominance, side of knee injury, and gender were analyzed in 65 male and 128 female skiers suffering from a noncontact ACL rupture. RESULTS: Anterior cruciate ligament ruptures of the left knee occurred more frequently in female than in male recreational skiers (68% vs 48%, P = .006). For both genders, in 90%, the right leg was the preferred kicking leg. With regard to leg dominance, female skiers suffered more often from ACL ruptures of their nondominant leg than male skiers (63% vs 45%, P = .020). An adjusted odds ratio of 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.8) was calculated. CONCLUSION: Female skiers showed a 2-fold higher risk of suffering from an ACL rupture on their nondominant leg. Therefore, leg dominance seems to be a risk factor for noncontact ACL injuries in female recreational skiers.",Adolescent Adult Aged Anterior Cruciate Ligament/*injuries Athletes Athletic Injuries/*epidemiology Cohort Studies Female *Functional Laterality Humans Incidence Knee Injuries/epidemiology Male Middle Aged Risk Factors Skiing/*injuries/statistics & numerical data Young Adult
22425125,The socioeconomic status of donors and recipients of living unrelated renal transplants in the United States.,J Urol,Gore JL and Singer JS and Brown AF and Danovitch GM,washington,"PURPOSE: We evaluated unrelated living kidney donation in the United States and examined the characteristics of unrelated donor-recipient pairs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We accessed United Network for Organ Sharing files to identify adult living donor renal transplant recipients who received a transplant between 1997 and 2007. We evaluated factors associated with unrelated donation and compared a composite index of the socioeconomic characteristics of donor and recipient ZIP Codes between living unrelated and living related renal transplantation pairs. Spousal pairs were categorized as living related. RESULTS: Of 39,168 adult renal transplant recipients 19% underwent living unrelated renal transplantation. These recipients were more likely white (vs black, Hispanic and other race OR 0.77-0.82, p <0.05) and more highly educated (college vs less than high school OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.54-0.77), and more commonly received care at high volume transplant centers (vs lowest volume centers OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.95). Living unrelated renal transplantation recipients and donors lived in higher socioeconomic status index ZIP Codes than living related recipients (mean +/- SD recipients and donors 0.62 +/- 3.74 and 0.44 +/- 3.63 vs 0.03 +/- 3.85 and 0.10 +/- 3.87, respectively, each p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Living unrelated renal transplantation donors and recipients are generally of higher socioeconomic status than their living related renal transplantation counterparts.

22493463,Adherence to colorectal cancer screening: a randomized clinical trial of competing strategies.,Arch Intern Med,Inadomi JM and Vijan S and Janz NK and Fagerlin A and Thomas JP and Lin YV and Munoz R and Lau C and Somsouk M and El-Nachef N and Hayward RA,washington,"BACKGROUND: Despite evidence that several colorectal cancer (CRC) screening strategies can reduce CRC mortality, screening rates remain low. This study aimed to determine whether the approach by which screening is recommended influences adherence. METHODS: We used a cluster randomization design with clinic time block as the unit of randomization. Persons at average risk for development of CRC in a racially/ethnically diverse urban setting were randomized to receive recommendation for screening by fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), colonoscopy, or their choice of FOBT or colonoscopy. The primary outcome was completion of CRC screening within 12 months after enrollment, defined as performance of colonoscopy, or 3 FOBT cards plus colonoscopy for any positive FOBT result. Secondary analyses evaluated sociodemographic factors associated with completion of screening. RESULTS: A total of 997 participants were enrolled; 58% completed the CRC screening strategy they were assigned or chose. However, participants who were recommended colonoscopy completed screening at a significantly lower rate (38%) than participants who were recommended FOBT (67%) (P < .001) or given a choice between FOBT or colonoscopy (69%) (P < .001). Latinos and Asians (primarily Chinese) completed screening more often than African Americans. Moreover, nonwhite participants adhered more often to FOBT, while white participants adhered more often to colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The common practice of universally recommending colonoscopy may reduce adherence to CRC screening, especially among racial/ethnic minorities. Significant variation in overall and strategy-specific adherence exists between racial/ethnic groups; however, this may be a proxy for health beliefs and/or language. These results suggest that patient preferences should be considered when making CRC screening recommendations.

METHODS: In a nationwide cohort, we compared the risk for ending cohabitation of the parents of 2450 children (aged 0-20 years) given a diagnosis of cancer with the risk of parents of 44 853 randomly selected, gender- and age-matched cancer-free children. We adjusted for socioeconomic position and demographic factors. Rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals for separation were estimated in a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The parents of children with cancer did not have a higher risk for separation than the general population (rate ratio: 1.00 [95% confidence interval: 0.91-1.10]). Separate analyses according to type of cancer and survival of the child similarly yielded null results. CONCLUSIONS: Experiencing cancer in a child does not seem to be a risk factor for separation. Our study will allow clinicians to reassure parents and to support them in facing the trauma of cancer in their child.","Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Denmark Divorce/*statistics & numerical data Female Humans Infant Male Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology *Parents Registries Risk Factors Young Adult"
22711079,Benefits and harms of pharmacologic treatment for urinary incontinence in women: a systematic review.,Ann Intern Med,Shamliyan T and Wyman JF and Ramakrishnan R and Sainfort F and Kane RL,umn,"BACKGROUND: Urinary incontinence (UI) in women adversely affects quality of life. PURPOSE: To conduct a systematic literature review of drugs for urgency UI in women. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCIRUS, and Google Scholar were searched for articles published from 1966 to November 2011. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) reported in English. DATA EXTRACTION: Rates of outcomes and risk of bias were extracted by using a standardized form to pool absolute risk differences and calculate the number of attributable events per 1000 patients treated, with 95% CIs. DATA SYNTHESIS: 94 RCTs were eligible. Pooled analyses showed that among drugs for urgency UI, per 1000 treated women, continence was restored in 130 with fesoterodine (CI, 58 to 202), 85 with tolterodine (CI, 40 to 129), 114 with oxybutynin (CI, 64 to 163), 107 with solifenacin (CI, 58 to 156), and 114 with trospium (CI, 83 to 144). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects were 31 per 1000 treated with fesoterodine (CI, 10 to 56), 63 with oxybutynin (CI, 12 to 127), 18 with trospium (CI, 4 to 33), and 13 with solifenacin (CI, 1 to 26). The studies' inconsistent definitions of reduction in UI and quality of life hampered synthesis of evidence. LIMITATION: Evidence for quality-of-life improvements and comparative effectiveness with drugs was limited, and evidence for the effects of race, baseline severity of UI, and comorbid conditions on treatment success was insufficient. CONCLUSION: Overall, drugs for urgency UI showed similar small benefit. Therapeutic choices should consider the harms profile.

Using a meta-analysis, we investigated the efficacy of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in the secondary prevention of CVD. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library in April 2011. Two of us independently reviewed and selected eligible randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: Of 1007 articles retrieved, 14 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (involving 20 485 patients with a history of CVD) were included in the final analyses. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids did not reduce the risk of overall cardiovascular events (relative risk, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.89-1.09), all-cause mortality, sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or transient ischemic attack and stroke. There was a small reduction in cardiovascular death (relative risk, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99), which disappeared when we excluded a study with major methodological problems. Furthermore, no significant preventive effect was observed in subgroup analyses by the following: country location, inland or coastal geographic area, history of CVD, concomitant medication use, type of placebo material in the trial, methodological quality of the trial, duration of treatment, dosage of eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid, or use of fish oil supplementation only as treatment. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis showed insufficient evidence of a secondary preventive effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplements against overall cardiovascular events among patients with a history of cardiovascular disease.","Cardiovascular Diseases/*prevention & control Cause of Death *Dietary Supplements Docosahexaenoic Acids/therapeutic use Double-Blind Method Eicosapentaenoic Acid/therapeutic use Fatty Acids, Omega-3/*therapeutic use Female Humans Male Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic *Secondary Prevention Stroke/prevention & control Treatment Outcome"
22454412,Funding oncology clinical trials: are cooperative group trials sustainable?,J Clin Oncol,Seow HY and Whelan P and Levine MN and Cowan K and Lysakowski B and Kowaleski B and Snider A and Xu RY and Arnold A,Missing,"PURPOSE: Many oncology clinical trials departments (CTDs) are in serious fiscal deficit and their sustainability is in jeopardy. This study investigates whether the payment models used to fund industry versus cooperative group trials contribute to the fiscal deficit of a CTD. METHODS: We examined the lifetime costs of all cooperative group and industry trials activated in the CTD of a cancer center between 2007 and 2011. A trial's lifetime is defined as being from the date the first patient was accrued until the last patient's actual or projected final follow-up visit. For each trial, we calculated the lifetime monthly net income, which was defined as monthly revenue minus monthly costs. Data sources included study protocols, trial budgets, and accrual data. RESULTS: Of the 97 trials analyzed, 64 (66%) were cooperative group trials. The pattern of lifetime net income for cooperative group trials has a positive peak during patient accrual followed by a negative trough during follow-up. In contrast, the pattern for industry trials resembled an ""l"" shape. The patterns reflect the differing payment models: upfront lump-sum payments (cooperative group) versus milestone payments (industry). CONCLUSION: The negative trough in the lifetime net income of a cooperative group trial occurs because follow-up costs are typically not funded or are underfunded. CTDs accrue more patients in new trials to offset that deficit. The CTD uses revenue from accrual to existing trials to cross-subsidize past trials in follow-up. As the number of patients on follow-up increases, the fiscal deficit grows larger each year, perpetuating the cycle.","Academic Medical Centers/*economics/organization & administration Canada Cancer Care Facilities/*economics/organization & administration Clinical Trials as Topic/*economics *Cooperative Behavior Health Care Costs Health Care Sector/*economics/organization & administration Health Expenditures Humans Income Models, Economic Neoplasms/*economics/*therapy *Research Design *Research Support as Topic/organization & administration Retrospective Studies Time Factors Treatment Outcome"
22473362,Measles-containing vaccines and febrile seizures in children age 4 to 6 years.,Pediatrics,Klein NP and Lewis E and Baxter R and Weintraub E and Glanz J and Naleway A and Jackson LA and Nordin J and Lieu T and Belongia EA and Fireman B,kp,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, children receive 2 doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) and varicella vaccine (V), the first between ages 1 to 2 years and the second between ages 4 to 6 years. Among 1- to 2-year-olds, the risk of febrile seizures 7 to 10 days after MMRV is double that after separate MMR + V. Whether MMRV or MMR + V affects risk for febrile seizure risk among 4- to 6-year-olds has not been reported. METHODS: Among 4- to 6-year-old Vaccine Safety Datalink members, we identified seizures in the emergency department and hospital from 2000 to 2008 and outpatient visits for fever from 2006 to 2008 during days 7 to 10 and 0 to 42 after MMRV and MMR + V. Incorporating medical record reviews, we assessed seizure risk after MMRV and MMR + V. RESULTS: From 2006 through 2008, 86 750 children received MMRV; from 2000 through 2008, 67 438 received same-day MMR + V. Seizures were rare throughout days 0 to 42 without peaking during days 7 to 10. There was 1 febrile seizure 7 to 10 days after MMRV and 0 after MMR + V. Febrile seizure risk was 1 per 86 750 MMRV doses (95% confidence interval, 1 per 3 426 441, 1 per 15 570) and 0 per 67 438 MMR + V doses (1 per 18 282). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides reassurance that MMRV and MMR + V were not associated with increased risk of febrile seizures among 4- to 6-year-olds. We can rule out with 95% confidence a risk greater than 1 febrile seizure per 15 500 MMRV doses and 1 per 18 000 MMR + V doses.","Chickenpox Vaccine/*adverse effects Child Child, Preschool Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions Humans Immunization, Secondary/adverse effects Infant Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine/*adverse effects Risk Seizures, Febrile/*chemically induced United States Vaccines, Combined"

Data on actual and expected participation in 36 leisure activities were collected preoperatively and at 12 months in 90 patients with knee osteoarthritis. Despite high expectations, there were statistically and clinically significant differences between actual and expected activity at 12 months suggesting that expectations may not have been fulfilled. The differences were equivalent to walking 14 less miles per week than expected, which is more than the amount of activity recommended in national physical activity guidelines. Perhaps an educational intervention could be implemented to help patients establish appropriate and realistic leisure activity expectations before surgery.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee/*psychology Cohort Studies Female Humans Leisure Activities/*psychology Male Middle Aged Osteoarthritis, Knee/psychology/*surgery *Patient Satisfaction Postoperative Period Prospective Studies Questionnaires Time Factors Treatment Outcome Walking"

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a video designed to address concerns of ethnic groups about organ donation. DESIGN: Cluster randomized, controlled trial. Randomization was performed by using a random-number table with centralized allocation concealment. Participants and investigators assessing outcomes were not blinded to group assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00870506) SETTING: Twelve branches of the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles in northeastern Ohio. PARTICIPANTS: 952 participants aged 15 to 66 years. INTERVENTION: Video (intervention; n = 443) or usual Bureau of Motor Vehicles license practices (control; n = 509). MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who provided consent for organ donation on a newly acquired driver's license, learner's permit, or state identification card. Secondary outcomes included willingness to make a living kidney donation to a family member in need and personal beliefs about donation. RESULTS: More participants who viewed the video consented to donate organs than control participants (84% vs. 72%; difference, 12 percentage points [95% CI, 6 to 17 percentage points]). The video was effective among black participants (76% vs. 54%; difference, 22 percentage points [CI, 9 to 35 percentage points]) and white participants (88% vs. 77%; difference, 11 percentage points [CI, 5 to 15 percentage points]). At the end of the trial, fewer intervention than control participants reported having insufficient information about organ donation (34% vs. 44%; difference, -10 percentage points [CI, -16 to -4 percentage points]), wanting to be buried with all of their organs (14% vs. 25%; difference, -11 percentage points [CI, -16 to -6 percentage points]), and having conflicts with organ donation (7% vs. 11%; difference, -4 percentage points [CI, -8 to -2 percentage points]). LIMITATION: How the observed increases in consent to donate organs might translate into a greater organ supply in the region is unclear. CONCLUSION: Exposure to a brief video addressing concerns that ethnic groups have about organ donation just before obtaining a license, permit, or identification card increased consent to donate organs among white and black participants.

22413831,The prevalence of urinary incontinence 20 years after childbirth: a national cohort study in singleton primiparae after vaginal or caesarean delivery.,BJOG,Gyhagen M and Bullarbo M and Nielsen TF and Milsom I,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors for urinary incontinence (UI) 20 years after one vaginal delivery or one caesarean section. DESIGN: Registry-based national cohort study. SETTING: Women who returned postal questionnaires (response rate 65.2%) in 2008. POPULATION: Singleton primiparae who delivered in the period 1985-1988 with no further births (n = 5236). METHODS: The Swedish Pregnancy, Obesity and Pelvic Floor (SWEPOP) study linked Medical Birth Register (MBR) data to a questionnaire about UI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of UI and UI for more than 10 years (UI > 10 years) were assessed 20 years after childbirth. RESULTS: The prevalence of UI (40.3 versus 28.8%; OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.45-1.92) and UI > 10 years (10.1 versus 3.9%; OR 2.75; 95% CI 2.02-3.75) was higher in women after vaginal delivery than after caesarean section. There was no difference in the prevalence of UI or UI > 10 years after an acute caesarean section or an elective caesarean section. We found an 8% increased risk of UI per current body mass index (BMI) unit, and age at delivery increased the UI risk by 3% annually. CONCLUSIONS: Two decades after one birth, vaginal delivery was associated with a 67% increased risk of UI, and UI > 10 years increased by 275% compared with caesarean section. Our data indicate that it is necessary to perform eight or nine caesarean sections to avoid one case of UI. Weight control is an important prophylactic measure to reduce UI.

22276996,Continuing to wear nicotine patches after smoking lapses promotes recovery of abstinence.,Addiction,Ferguson SG and Gitchell JG and Shiffman S,Missing,"AIMS: Smokers who lapse during a cessation attempt are at particularly high risk of relapse, so interventions to help smokers recover from lapses are urgently needed. Two recent studies have suggested continuing to use nicotine patches following a lapse may be a beneficial relapse prevention strategy. However, to date no study that uses approved doses of nicotine patches under real-world conditions has tested this hypothesis. DESIGN AND SETTING: Clinical trial conducted across eight US study sites. PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Using data from 509 subjects (240 active; 269 placebo) who lapsed during weeks 3-5 of treatment in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 21-mg nicotine patches, we examined whether active nicotine patch use improved the chances of recovering abstinence (7-day point-prevalence) at weeks 6 and 10. FINDINGS: Active patch use (versus placebo) increased the likelihood of recovery from a lapse both at 6 weeks [8.3% versus 0.8%; relative risk (RR) = 11.0, P < 0.001] and at 10 weeks (9.6% versus 2.6%; RR = 3.7, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Continuing treatment to aid smoking cessation with active patches promotes recovery from lapses.

22473365,Maternal caffeine consumption and infant nighttime waking: prospective cohort study.,Pediatrics,Santos IS and Matijasevich A and Domingues MR,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: Coffee and other caffeinated beverages are commonly consumed in pregnancy. In adults, caffeine may interfere with sleep onset and have a dose-response effect similar to those seen during insomnia. In infancy, nighttime waking is a common event. With this study, we aimed to investigate if maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy and lactation leads to frequent nocturnal awakening among infants at 3 months of age. METHODS: All children born in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, during 2004 were enrolled on a cohort study. Mothers were interviewed at delivery and after 3 months to obtain information on caffeine drinking consumption, sociodemographic, reproductive, and behavioral characteristics. Infant sleeping pattern in the previous 15 days was obtained from a subsample. Night waking was defined as an episode of infant arousal that woke the parents during nighttime. Multivariable analysis was performed by using Poisson regression. RESULTS: The subsample included 885 of the 4231 infants born in 2004. All but 1 mother consumed caffeine in pregnancy. Nearly 20% were heavy consumers (>/=300 mg/day) during pregnancy and 14.3% at 3 months postpartum. Prevalence of frequent nighttime awakeners (>3 episodes per night) was 13.8% (95% confidence interval: 11.5%-16.0%). The highest prevalence ratio was observed among breastfed infants from mothers consuming >/=300 mg/day during the whole pregnancy and in the postpartum period (1.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.86-3.17) but at a nonsignificant level. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine consumption during pregnancy and by nursing mothers seems not to have consequences on sleep of infants at the age of 3 months.","Adult Arousal/drug effects Brazil *Breast Feeding Caffeine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Cohort Studies Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Female Humans Infant Infant Behavior/*drug effects Infant, Newborn Male Multivariate Analysis Poisson Distribution Pregnancy *Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects Socioeconomic Factors Wakefulness/*drug effects Young Adult"
22481014,Effects of curcuminoids on frequency of acute myocardial infarction after coronary artery bypass grafting.,Am J Cardiol,Wongcharoen W and Jai-Aue S and Phrommintikul A and Nawarawong W and Woragidpoonpol S and Tepsuwan T and Sukonthasarn A and Apaijai N and Chattipakorn N,Missing,"It is well established that myocardial infarction (MI) associated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) predicts a poor outcome. Nevertheless, cardioprotective therapies to limit myocardial injury after CABG are lacking. Previous studies have shown that curcuminoids decrease proinflammatory cytokines during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and decrease the occurrence of cardiomyocytic apoptosis after cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury in animal models. We aimed to evaluate whether curcuminoids prevent MI after CABG compared to placebo. The 121 consecutive patients undergoing CABG were randomly allocated to receive placebo or curcuminoids 4 g/day beginning 3 days before the scheduled surgery and continued until 5 days after surgery. The primary end point was incidence of in-hospital MI. The secondary end point was the effect of curcuminoids on C-reactive protein, plasma malondialdehyde, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the curcuminoid and placebo groups. Mean age was 61 +/- 9 years. On-pump CABG procedures were performed in 51.2% of patients. Incidence of in-hospital MI was decreased from 30.0% in the placebo group to 13.1% in the curcuminoid group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.35, 0.13 to 0.95, p = 0.038). Postoperative C-reactive protein, malondialdehyde, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were also lower in the curcuminoid than in the placebo group. In conclusion, we demonstrated that curcuminoids significantly decreased MI associated with CABG. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of curcuminoids may account for their cardioprotective effects shown in this study.","Administration, Oral Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use Coronary Angiography *Coronary Artery Bypass Coronary Artery Disease/diagnosis/surgery *Curcuma Curcumin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/*therapeutic use Double-Blind Method Drug Combinations Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Myocardial Infarction/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control Phytotherapy/*methods Plant Preparations/administration & dosage/therapeutic use Preoperative Care/methods Prospective Studies Thailand/epidemiology Treatment Outcome"
22493417,Quality of breast cancer care: perception versus practice.,J Clin Oncol,Bickell NA and Neuman J and Fei K and Franco R and Joseph KA,mssm,"PURPOSE: Because insurers use performance and quality metrics to inform reimbursement, identifying remediable causes of poor-quality cancer care is imperative. We undertook this descriptive cohort study to assess key predictors of women's perceived quality of their breast cancer care and actual guideline-concordant quality of care received. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We surveyed inner-city women with newly diagnosed and surgically treated early-stage breast cancer requiring adjuvant treatment who were enrolled onto a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patient assistance to reduce disparities in care. We assessed women's perceived quality of care and perceived quality of the process of getting care, such as getting referrals, test results, and treatments; we abstracted records to determine the actual quality of care. RESULTS: Of the 374 new patients with early-stage breast cancer enrolled onto the RCT, only a slight majority of women (55%) perceived their quality of care as excellent; 88% actually received good-quality, guideline-concordant care. Excellent perceived quality (P < .001) was significantly associated with patients' perception of the quality of the process of getting care (adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.78; 95% CI, 1.65 to 1.87). Also associated with perceived quality-and mediated by race-were trust in one's physician (adjusted RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.64) and perceived racism, which affected black women more than women of other races/ethnicities (black race-adjusted RR for perceived racism, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.87]; black race-adjusted RR for trust, 1.61 [95% CI, 0.97 to 1.90]; c = 0.82 for the model; P < .001). Actual quality of care provided did not affect perceived quality of care received. CONCLUSION: Patients' perceived quality of care differs from their receipt of high-quality care. Mutable targets to improve perceived quality of care include the processes of getting care and trusting their physician.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/ethnology/psychology/*therapy Ethnic Groups/psychology Female Guideline Adherence Health Care Surveys *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice/ethnology Humans Logistic Models *Mastectomy/standards Middle Aged Neoplasm Staging New York City Odds Ratio Patient Satisfaction Patients/*psychology *Perception Physician-Patient Relations Practice Guidelines as Topic *Quality of Health Care/standards Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic *Urban Health Services/standards"
22508978,The variability of reported salt levels in fast foods across six countries: opportunities for salt reduction.,CMAJ,Dunford E and Webster J and Woodward M and Czernichow S and Yuan WL and Jenner K and Ni Mhurchu C and Jacobson M and Campbell N and Neal B,georgeinstitute,"BACKGROUND: Several fast food companies have made commitments to reduce the levels of salt in the foods they serve, but technical issues are often cited as a barrier to achieving substantial reductions. Our objective was to examine the reported salt levels for products offered by leading multinational fast food chains. METHODS: Data on salt content for products served by six fast food chains operating in Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States were collected by survey in April 2010. Mean salt contents (and their ranges) were calculated and compared within and between countries and companies. RESULTS: We saw substantial variation in the mean salt content for different categories of products. For example, the salads we included in our survey contained 0.5 g of salt per 100 g, whereas the chicken products we included contained 1.6 g. We also saw variability between countries: chicken products from the UK contained 1.1 g of salt per 100 g, whereas chicken products from the US contained 1.8 g. Furthermore, the mean salt content of food categories varied between companies and between the same products in different countries (e.g., McDonald's Chicken McNuggets contain 0.6 g of salt per 100 g in the UK, but 1.6 g of salt per 100 g in the US). INTERPRETATION: The salt content of fast foods varies substantially, not only by type of food, but by company and country in which the food is produced. Although the reasons for this variation are not clear, the marked differences in salt content of very similar products suggest that technical reasons are not a primary explanation. In the right regulatory environment, it is likely that fast food companies could substantially reduce the salt in their products, translating to large gains for population health.","*Data Collection Diet, Sodium-Restricted/*utilization *Fast Foods Food Analysis/*methods *Food Industry Humans *Nutritive Value *Public Health Sodium Chloride, Dietary/*analysis"

PURPOSE: To summarize evidence about the benefits and harms of screening for and monitoring and treatment of CKD stages 1 to 3 in adults. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1985 through November 2011), reference lists, and expert suggestions. STUDY SELECTION: English-language, randomized, controlled trials that evaluated screening for or monitoring or treatment of CKD and that reported clinical outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers assessed study characteristics and rated quality and strength of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: No trials evaluated screening or monitoring, and 110 evaluated treatments. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (relative risk, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.49 to 0.88]) and angiotensin II-receptor blockers (relative risk, 0.77 [CI, 0.66 to 0.90]) reduced end-stage renal disease versus placebo, primarily in patients with diabetes who have macroalbuminuria. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduced mortality versus placebo (relative risk, 0.79 [CI, 0.66 to 0.96]) in patients with microalbuminuria and cardiovascular disease or high-risk diabetes. Statins and beta-blockers reduced mortality and cardiovascular events versus placebo or control in patients with impaired estimated glomerular filtration rate and either hyperlipidemia or congestive heart failure, respectively. Risks for mortality, end-stage renal disease, or other clinical outcomes did not significantly differ between strict and usual blood pressure control. The strength of evidence was rated high for angiotensin II-receptor blockers and statins, moderate for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, and low for strict blood pressure control. LIMITATIONS: Evidence about outcomes was sometimes scant and derived from post hoc analyses of subgroups of patients enrolled in trials. Few trials reported or systematically collected information about adverse events. Selective reporting and publication bias were possible. CONCLUSION: The role of CKD screening or monitoring in improving clinical outcomes is uncertain. Evidence for CKD treatment benefit is strongest for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II-receptor blockers, and in patients with albuminuria combined with diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional error analysis of audiotaped emergency department (ED) visits during 30 months in the 2 largest pediatric EDs in Massachusetts. Participants were Spanish-speaking limited-English-proficient patients, caregivers, and their interpreters. Outcome measures included interpreter error numbers, types, and potential consequences. RESULTS: The 57 encounters included 20 with professional interpreters, 27 with ad hoc interpreters, and 10 with no interpreters; 1,884 interpreter errors were noted, and 18% had potential clinical consequences. The proportion of errors of potential consequence was significantly lower for professional (12%) versus ad hoc (22%) versus no interpreters (20%). Among professional interpreters, previous hours of interpreter training, but not years of experience, were significantly associated with error numbers, types, and potential consequences. The median errors by professional interpreters with greater than or equal to 100 hours of training was significantly lower, at 12, versus 33 for those with fewer than 100 hours of training. Those with greater than or equal to 100 hours of training committed significantly lower proportions of errors of potential consequence overall (2% versus 12%) and in every error category. CONCLUSION: Professional interpreters result in a significantly lower likelihood of errors of potential consequence than ad hoc and no interpreters. Among professional interpreters, hours of previous training, but not years of experience, are associated with error numbers, types, and consequences. These findings suggest that requiring at least 100 hours of training for interpreters might have a major impact on reducing interpreter errors and their consequences in health care while improving quality and patient safety.","Child, Preschool Communication Barriers Cross-Sectional Studies Emergencies Emergency Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical data Female Humans Male Massachusetts Medical Errors/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data Tape Recording *Translating"

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 2- and 4-month-old infants during well-child visits. Patients were assigned into 4 groups (2 x 2) receiving either 2 mL of water or 2 mL of 24% oral sucrose and then either standard-of-care comfort measures by parents or intervention with the 5 S's immediately postvaccination. The Modified Riley Pain Score was used to score the infants' pain at 15-second intervals for 2 minutes, then every 30 seconds up to 5 minutes postvaccination. Repeated-measures analysis of variance examined between group differences and within-subject variability of treatment effect on overall pain scores and length of crying. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty infants were enrolled. Results revealed significantly different mean pain scores between study groups with the exception of the 5S's and 5S's with sucrose groups. These 2 groups had lower similar mean scores over time, followed by sucrose alone, then control. The same trend was found with the proportion of children crying as with the mean pain score outcome measure. CONCLUSIONS: Physical intervention of the 5 S's (swaddling, side/stomach position, shushing, swinging, and sucking) provided decreased pain scores on a validated pain scale and decreased crying time among 2- and 4-month-old infants during routine vaccinations.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The study was conducted using the electronic medical databases of a large health maintenance organization in Israel. PATIENTS: The study population consisted of 14 682 adolescents and young adults who were new users of isotretinoin for acne and 2 age- and sex-matched comparison groups (isotretinoin-naive patients with acne and acne-free patients). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ocular adverse effects (AEs) or purchases of ophthalmic medications within 1 year after the first dispensed isotretinoin prescription. RESULTS: In total, 13.8% of the isotretinoin group experienced ocular AEs vs 9.6% of the isotretinoin-naive group and 7.1% of the acne-free group. During a 1-year follow-up period, the isotretinoin group had significantly higher risk for any ocular AEs (hazard ratio, 1.70; P.001) compared with the acne-free group. No such increased risk was observed for the isotretinoin-naive group. The isotretinoin group had higher relative risks for inflammatory and structural AEs. CONCLUSION: Isotretinoin use may be associated with short-term ocular events, especially conjunctivitis, underscoring the importance of educating patients and caregivers about these potentially important AEs of the therapy.","Acne Vulgaris/*drug therapy Adolescent Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies Conjunctivitis/chemically induced/epidemiology Databases, Factual Dermatologic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use Eye Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology Follow-Up Studies Health Maintenance Organizations Humans Isotretinoin/*adverse effects/therapeutic use Israel/epidemiology Male Patient Education as Topic/methods Proportional Hazards Models Retrospective Studies Risk Young Adult"

We present an integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression in a discovery and validation set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours, respectively, with long-term clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) were associated with expression in ~40% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting CNAs. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by CNAs, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in PPP2R2A, MTAP and MAP2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired DNA-RNA profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of CNAs. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a TCR deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the 'CNA-devoid' subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic CNAs on the transcriptome.","Breast Neoplasms/classification/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology DNA Copy Number Variations/*genetics Female *Gene Expression Profiling *Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Regulatory Networks/genetics Genes, Neoplasm/genetics Genome, Human/*genetics Genomics Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate MAP Kinase Kinase 4/genetics Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics Prognosis Protein Phosphatase 2/genetics Treatment Outcome"

Consequently, patients are vulnerable when breakdowns in care occur. This study explored cancer patients' perceptions of preventable, harmful events; the impact of these events; and interactions with clinicians after such events. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In-depth telephone interviews were conducted with cancer patients from three clinical sites. Patients were eligible if they believed: something ""went wrong"" during their cancer care; the event could have been prevented; and the event caused, or could have caused, significant harm. Interviews focused on patients' perceptions of the event, its impact, and clinicians' responses to the event. RESULTS: Ninety-three of 416 patients queried believed something had gone wrong in their care that was preventable and caused or could have caused harm. Seventy-eight patients completed interviews. Of those interviewed, 28% described a problem with medical care, such as a delay in diagnosis or treatment; 47% described a communication problem, including problems with information exchange or manner; and 24% described problems with both medical care and communication. Perceived harms included physical and emotional harm, disruption of life, effect on family members, damaged physician-patient relationship, and financial expense. Few clinicians initiated discussion of the problematic events. Most patients did not formally report their concerns. CONCLUSION: Cancer patients who believe they experienced a preventable, harmful event during their cancer diagnosis or care often do not formally report their concerns. Systems are needed to encourage patients to report such events and to help physicians and health care systems respond effectively.","Adult Cooperative Behavior Delivery of Health Care, Integrated/*organization & administration *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Health Maintenance Organizations Humans Interviews as Topic Male Medical Errors/*prevention & control/psychology Medical Oncology/*organization & administration Middle Aged Neoplasms/diagnosis/psychology/*therapy Organizational Objectives Patient Care Team/organization & administration Patient Safety Patient-Centered Care/*organization & administration Patients/*psychology *Perception Physician-Patient Relations Risk Assessment Risk Factors Treatment Outcome United States Young Adult"

Recently, concern about possible links between periodontal disease (PD) and atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASVD) has intensified and is driving an active field of investigation into possible association and causality. The 2 disorders share several common risk factors, including cigarette smoking, age, and diabetes mellitus. Patients and providers are increasingly presented with claims that PD treatment strategies offer ASVD protection; these claims are often endorsed by professional and industrial stakeholders. The focus of this review is to assess whether available data support an independent association between ASVD and PD and whether PD treatment might modify ASVD risks or outcomes. It also presents mechanistic details of both PD and ASVD relevant to this topic. The correlation of PD with ASVD outcomes and surrogate markers is discussed, as well as the correlation of response to PD therapy with ASVD event rates. Methodological issues that complicate studies of this association are outlined, with an emphasis on the terms and metrics that would be applicable in future studies. Observational studies to date support an association between PD and ASVD independent of known confounders. They do not, however, support a causative relationship. Although periodontal interventions result in a reduction in systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in short-term studies, there is no evidence that they prevent ASVD or modify its outcomes.",American Heart Association Atherosclerosis/*epidemiology Cardiology/*standards Evidence-Based Medicine/*standards Humans Periodontal Diseases/*epidemiology Risk Factors United States

However, the association between preventive dentistry and cardiovascular risk reduction has remained undetermined. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between tooth scaling and the risk of cardiovascular events by using a nationwide, population-based study and a prospective cohort design. METHODS: Our analyses were conducted using information from a random sample of 1 million persons enrolled in the nationally representative Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Exposed individuals consisted of all subjects who were aged >/= 50 years and who received at least 1 tooth scaling in 2000. The comparison group of non-exposed persons consisted of persons who did not undergo tooth scaling and were matched to exposed individuals using propensity score matching by the time of enrollment, age, gender, history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. RESULTS: During an average follow-up period of 7 years, 10,887 subjects who had ever received tooth scaling (exposed group) and 10,989 age-, gender-, and comorbidity-matched subjects who had not received tooth scaling (non-exposed group) were enrolled. The exposed group had a lower incidence of acute myocardial infarction (1.6% vs 2.2%, P<.001), stroke (8.9% vs 10%, P=.03), and total cardiovascular events (10% vs 11.6%, P<.001) when compared with the non-exposed group. After multivariate analysis, tooth scaling was an independent factor associated with less risk of developing future myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.85), stroke (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93), and total cardiovascular events (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-0.91). Furthermore, when compared with the non-exposed group, increasing frequency of tooth scaling correlated with a higher risk reduction of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and total cardiovascular events (P for trend<.001).

However, the potential long-term health effects have not been well established across different exposure situations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied 74,040 workers who worked at 29 metal mines and pottery factories in China for 1 y or more between January 1, 1960, and December 31, 1974, with follow-up until December 31, 2003 (median follow-up of 33 y). We estimated the cumulative silica dust exposure (CDE) for each worker by linking work history to a job-exposure matrix. We calculated standardized mortality ratios for underlying causes of death based on Chinese national mortality rates. Hazard ratios (HRs) for selected causes of death associated with CDE were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. The population attributable risks were estimated based on the prevalence of workers with silica dust exposure and HRs. The number of deaths attributable to silica dust exposure among Chinese workers was then calculated using the population attributable risk and the national mortality rate. We observed 19,516 deaths during 2,306,428 person-years of follow-up. Mortality from all causes was higher among workers exposed to silica dust than among non-exposed workers (993 versus 551 per 100,000 person-years). We observed significant positive exposure-response relationships between CDE (measured in milligrams/cubic meter-years, i.e., the sum of silica dust concentrations multiplied by the years of silica exposure) and mortality from all causes (HR 1.026, 95% confidence interval 1.023-1.029), respiratory diseases (1.069, 1.064-1.074), respiratory tuberculosis (1.065, 1.059-1.071), and cardiovascular disease (1.031, 1.025-1.036). Significantly elevated standardized mortality ratios were observed for all causes (1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.11), ischemic heart disease (1.65, 1.35-1.99), and pneumoconiosis (11.01, 7.67-14.95) among workers exposed to respirable silica concentrations equal to or lower than 0.1 mg/m(3). After adjustment for potential confounders, including smoking, silica dust exposure accounted for 15.2% of all deaths in this study. We estimated that 4.2% of deaths (231,104 cases) among Chinese workers were attributable to silica dust exposure. The limitations of this study included a lack of data on dietary patterns and leisure time physical activity, possible underestimation of silica dust exposure for individuals who worked at the mines/factories before 1950, and a small number of deaths (4.3%) where the cause of death was based on oral reports from relatives. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term silica dust exposure was associated with substantially increased mortality among Chinese workers. The increased risk was observed not only for deaths due to respiratory diseases and lung cancer, but also for deaths due to cardiovascular disease.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 3,123 ambulatory patients with invasive cancer of the breast, prostate, colon/rectum, or lung were enrolled onto this prospective study regardless of phase of care or stage of disease. At initial assessment and 4 to 5 weeks later, patients completed a 25-item measure of pain, functional interference, and other symptoms. Providers recorded analgesic prescribing. The pain management index was calculated to assess treatment adequacy. RESULTS: Of the 3,023 patients we identified to be at risk for pain, 2,026 (67%) reported having pain or requiring analgesics at initial assessment; of these 2,026 patients, 670 (33%) were receiving inadequate analgesic prescribing. We found no difference in treatment adequacy between the initial and follow-up visits. Multivariable analysis revealed that the odds of a non-Hispanic white patient having inadequate pain treatment were approximately half those of a minority patient after adjusting for other explanatory variables (odds ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.70; P = .002). Other significant predictors of inadequate pain treatment were having a good performance status, being treated at a minority treatment site, and having nonadvanced disease without concurrent treatment. CONCLUSION: Most outpatients with common solid tumors must confront issues related to pain and the use of analgesics. There is significant disparity in pain treatment adequacy, with the odds of undertreatment twice as high for minority patients.

DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted from 2004 to 2008. SETTING: Thirteen public neurology departments in Norway. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18 to 55 years with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, with a disability score equivalent to 5.0 or less on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale. Ninety-two patients were randomized to omega-3 fatty acids (n = 46) or placebo capsules (n = 46). INTERVENTIONS: Administration of 1350 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 850 mg of docosahexaenoic acid daily or placebo. After 6 months, all patients in addition received subcutaneously 44 mug of interferon beta-1a 3 times per week for another 18 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure was MRI disease activity as measured by the number of new T1-weighted gadolinium-enhancing lesions during the first 6 months. Secondary outcome measures included MRI disease activity after 9 months and 24 months, relapse rate, disability progression, fatigue, quality of life, and safety. RESULTS: The cumulative number of gadolinium-enhancing MRI lesions during the first 6 months were similar in the omega-3 fatty acids and placebo groups (median difference, 1; 95% CI, 0 to 3; P = .09). No difference in relapse rate was detected after 6 (median difference, 0; 95% CI, 0 to 0; P = .54) or 24 (median difference, 0; 95% CI, 0 to 0; P = .72) months. The proportion of patients without disability progression was 70% in both groups (P > .99). No differences were detected in fatigue or quality-of-life scores, and no safety concerns appeared.

Women (n = 218) were enrolled after surgery and observed at end treatment and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months as well as 5 years. Structured interviews and self-report questionnaires were used to record physical and psychologic health as well as disability and health care utilization. Patients with CRF persisting for 6 months were assessed to exclude alternative medical and psychiatric causes of fatigue. Predictors of persistent fatigue, mood disturbance, and health care utilization were sought by logistic regression. RESULTS: The case rate for CRF was 24% (n = 51) postsurgery and 31% (n = 69) at end of treatment; it became persistent in 11% (n = 24) at 6 months and 6% (n = 12) at 12 months. At each time point, approximately one third of the patients had comorbid mood disturbance. Persistent CRF was predicted by tumor size but not demographic, psychologic, surgical, or hematologic parameters. CRF was associated with significant disability and health care utilization. CONCLUSION: CRF is common but generally runs a self-limiting course. Much of the previously reported high rates of persistent CRF may be attributable to factors unrelated to the cancer or its treatment.","Adult Affect Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy Chemoradiotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects Chi-Square Distribution Comorbidity Disability Evaluation Fatigue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology Female Humans Interviews as Topic Linear Models Logistic Models Mastectomy/*adverse effects Middle Aged Neoplasm Staging New South Wales Odds Ratio Prospective Studies Questionnaires Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects Risk Assessment Risk Factors Time Factors Treatment Outcome Tumor Burden"
22480818,"Effect of escitalopram on hot flash interference: a randomized, controlled trial.",Fertil Steril,Carpenter JS and Guthrie KA and Larson JC and Freeman EW and Joffe H and Reed SD and Ensrud KE and LaCroix AZ,iupui,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of escitalopram (10-20 mg/d) versus placebo for reducing hot flash interference in daily life and understand correlates and predictors of reductions in hot flash interference, a key measure of quality of life. DESIGN: Multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. SETTING: MsFLASH clinical sites in Boston, Indianapolis, Oakland, and Philadelphia. PATIENT(S): A total of 205 midlife women (46% African-American) who met criteria participated. INTERVENTION(S): After baseline, women were randomized to one pill of escitalopram 10 mg/d (n = 104) or placebo (n = 101) with follow-up at 4 and 8 weeks. At week 4, those not achieving 50% fewer hot flashes were increased to two pills daily (20 mg/d or 2 placebo pills). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale; correlates were variables from hot flash diaries; predictors were baseline demographics, clinical variables, depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and hot flashes. RESULT(S): Compared to placebo, escitalopram significantly reduced hot flash interference by 6.0 points at week 4 and 3.4 points at week 8 more than placebo. Reductions in hot flash interference correlated with changes in hot flash diary variables. However, baseline variables did not significantly predict reductions in hot flash interference. CONCLUSION(S): Escitalopram (10-20 mg/d) for 8 weeks improves women's quality of life and this benefit did not vary by demographic, clinical, mood, sleep, or hot flash variables.

22529279,Pharmacologic treatment of repetitive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders: evidence of publication bias.,Pediatrics,Carrasco M and Volkmar FR and Bloch MH,umich,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the efficacy of serotonin receptor inhibitors (SRIs) for the treatment of repetitive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). METHODS: Two reviewers searched PubMed and Clinicaltrials.gov for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of SRIs for repetitive behaviors in ASD. Our primary outcome was mean improvement in ratings scales of repetitive behavior. Publication bias was assessed by using a funnel plot, the Egger's test, and a meta-regression of sample size and effect size. RESULTS: Our search identified 5 published and 5 unpublished but completed trials eligible for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of 5 published and 1 unpublished trial (which provided data) demonstrated a small but significant effect of SRI for the treatment of repetitive behaviors in ASD (standardized mean difference: 0.22 [95% confidence interval: 0.07-0.37], z score = 2.87, P < .005). There was significant evidence of publication bias in all analyses. When Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill method was used to adjust for the effect of publication bias, there was no longer a significant benefit of SRI for the treatment of repetitive behaviors in ASD (standardized mean difference: 0.12 [95% confidence interval: -0.02 to 0.27]). Secondary analyses demonstrated no significant effect of type of medication, patient age, method of analysis, trial design, or trial duration on reported SRI efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis of the published literature suggests a small but significant effect of SRI in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in ASD. This effect may be attributable to selective publication of trial results. Without timely, transparent, and complete disclosure of trial results, it remains difficult to determine the efficacy of available medications.","Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/*drug therapy Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Humans *Publication Bias Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use Stereotyped Behavior/*drug effects Stereotypic Movement Disorder/*drug therapy"

However, socioeconomic status (SES) and racial/ethnic differences in FOBT trends and their changes relative to endoscopic CRC screening have not been evaluated. METHODS: Data on adults ages 50 to 64 years from the 2000, 2005, and 2008 National Health Interview Surveys were used. Weighted analyses and multivariate logistic regression were used to study trends in the use of FOBT and endoscopic CRC screening during this period. RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2008, significant declines in FOBT prevalence occurred in higher SES groups, but not in lower SES groups (uninsured and publicly insured, those without a usual source of care, lower educated, lower income, and immigrants to the United States) or Hispanics. Endoscopic CRC screening during the period studied consistently increased in all higher SES subgroups. In contrast, few lower SES subgroups (publicly insured, lower educated, near poor individuals, long-term immigrants) and Hispanics experienced increases in CRC endoscopic screening, and these increases were smaller than those observed in higher SES subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Socially and economically disadvantaged groups experienced little or no change in FOBT prevalence, and few of these groups experienced contemporaneous increases in CRC endoscopic screening. These trends suggest the continued availability and acceptance of FOBT in these groups. If national CRC screening goals are to be achieved in populations with lower access to colonoscopy, then annual high-sensitivity FOBT should be promoted as an immediately accessible and viable alternative.",Colonoscopy/trends Colorectal Neoplasms/*diagnosis Early Detection of Cancer/*trends Female Humans Male Middle Aged *Occult Blood Social Class

We sent an anonymous survey to United States cardiology program directors and their chief fellow. The survey assessed the program curricula, rotation structure, faculty expertise, obstacles, and recommended improvements. The results revealed that 24% of surveyed programs met the Core Cardiovascular Training Symposium guidelines with a dedicated 1-month rotation in preventive cardiology, 24% had no formalized training in preventive cardiology, and 30% had no faculty with expertise in preventive cardiology, which correlated with fewer rotations in prevention than those with specialized faculty (p = 0.009). Fellows rotated though the following experiences (% of programs): cardiac rehabilitation, 71%; lipid management, 37%; hypertension, 15%; diabetes, 7%; weight management/obesity, 6%; cardiac nutrition, 6%; and smoking cessation, 5%. The program directors cited ""lack of time"" as the greatest obstacle to providing preventive cardiology training and the chief fellows reported ""lack of a developed curriculum"" (p = 0.01). The most recommended improvement was for the American College of Cardiology to develop a web-based curriculum/module. In conclusion, most surveyed United States cardiology training programs currently do not adhere to basic preventive cardiovascular medicine Core Cardiovascular Training Symposium recommendations.

METHODS: We analyzed data from 108 762 well-child visits (36 827 children) at a multisite pediatric practice in eastern Massachusetts during 1999-2008. By using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2000 gender-specific growth charts, we defined obesity as weight-for-length >/=95th percentile for children aged <24 months and BMI >/=95th percentile for children aged 24 to <72 months. By using multivariable logistic regression, we estimated gender-specific obesity trends in 2 separate periods, 1999-2003 and 2004-2008, adjusting for age group, race/ethnicity, health insurance, and practice site. RESULTS: From 1999 to 2003, the obesity prevalence was fairly stable among both boys and girls. From 2004 to 2008, the obesity prevalence substantially decreased among both boys and girls. The decline in obesity prevalence during 2004-2008 was more pronounced among children insured by non-Medicaid health plans than among those insured by Medicaid. CONCLUSIONS: Among children aged <6 years at this multisite pediatric practice, obesity prevalence decreased during 2004-2008, which is in line with national data showing no increase in prevalence during this time period. The smaller decrease among Medicaid-insured children may portend widening of socioeconomic disparities in childhood obesity.","Anthropometry Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Electronic Health Records Ethnic Groups/statistics & numerical data Female Humans Insurance Coverage Male Massachusetts Medicaid Obesity/*epidemiology/*prevention & control Reference Values Risk United States"
22534001,Assessment of the 2010 global measles mortality reduction goal: results from a model of surveillance data.,Lancet,Simons E and Ferrari M and Fricks J and Wannemuehler K and Anand A and Burton A and Strebel P,Missing,"BACKGROUND: In 2008 all WHO member states endorsed a target of 90% reduction in measles mortality by 2010 over 2000 levels. We developed a model to estimate progress made towards this goal. METHODS: We constructed a state-space model with population and immunisation coverage estimates and reported surveillance data to estimate annual national measles cases, distributed across age classes. We estimated deaths by applying age-specific and country-specific case-fatality ratios to estimated cases in each age-country class. FINDINGS: Estimated global measles mortality decreased 74% from 535,300 deaths (95% CI 347,200-976,400) in 2000 to 139,300 (71,200-447,800) in 2010. Measles mortality was reduced by more than three-quarters in all WHO regions except the WHO southeast Asia region. India accounted for 47% of estimated measles mortality in 2010, and the WHO African region accounted for 36%. INTERPRETATION: Despite rapid progress in measles control from 2000 to 2007, delayed implementation of accelerated disease control in India and continued outbreaks in Africa stalled momentum towards the 2010 global measles mortality reduction goal. Intensified control measures and renewed political and financial commitment are needed to achieve mortality reduction targets and lay the foundation for future global eradication of measles.

22499576,Dietary sodium and risk of stroke in the Northern Manhattan study.,Stroke,Gardener H and Rundek T and Wright CB and Elkind MS and Sacco RL,miami,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The American Heart Association recommends limiting sodium intake to </= 1500 mg/day for ideal cardiovascular health. Although sodium intake has been linked to vascular disease by direct relationship with hypertension, few studies have supported an association with stroke risk. METHODS: Participants were from the Northern Manhattan Study (mean age 69 +/- 10 years, 64% women, 21% white, 53% Hispanic, 24% black), a population-based cohort study of stroke incidence. Sodium intake was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire at baseline and evaluated continuously and categorically: </= 1500 mg/day (12%), 1501 to 2300 mg/day (24%), 2301 to 3999 mg/day (43%), and >/= 4000 mg/day (21%). Over a mean follow-up of 10 years, we examined the association between sodium consumption and 235 strokes using Cox models adjusting for sociodemographics, diet, behavioral/lifestyle, and vascular risk factors. RESULTS: Of 2657 participants with dietary data, the mean sodium intake was 3031 +/- 1470 mg/day (median, 2787; interquartile range, 1966-3815 mg/day). Participants who consumed >/= 4000 mg/day sodium had an increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.27-5.28) versus those who consumed </= 1500 mg/day with a 17% increased risk of stroke for each 500-mg/day increase (95% CI, 1.07-1.27). CONCLUSIONS: High sodium intake was prevalent and associated with an increased risk of stroke independent of vascular risk factors. The new American Heart Association dietary sodium goals will help reduce stroke risk.","African Americans Aged Cohort Studies European Continental Ancestry Group Female Follow-Up Studies Hispanic Americans Humans Incidence Longitudinal Studies Male Middle Aged Myocardial Infarction/*epidemiology/ethnology New York City/epidemiology Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Sodium, Dietary/*adverse effects Stroke/*epidemiology/ethnology"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed administrative data for 757,928 Ontarians with diabetes to examine the use of the code and receipt of three evidence-based monitoring tests from 2006 to 2008. We assessed testing rates over time and before and after billing of the incentive code. RESULTS: One-quarter of Ontarians with diabetes had an incentive code billed by their physician. The proportion receiving the optimal number of all three monitoring tests (HbA(1c), cholesterol, and eye tests) rose gradually from 16% in 2000 to 27% in 2008. Individuals who were younger, lived in rural areas, were not enrolled in a primary care model, or had a mental illness were less likely to receive all three recommended tests. Patients with higher numbers of incentive code billings in 2006-2008 were more likely to receive recommended testing but also were more likely to have received the highest level of recommended testing prior to introduction of the incentive code. Following the same patients over time, improvement in recommended testing was no greater after billing of the first incentive code than before. CONCLUSIONS: The diabetes incentive code led to minimal improvement in quality of diabetes care at the population and patient level. Our findings suggest that physicians who provide the highest quality care prior to incentives may be those most likely to claim incentive payments.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Canada *Diabetes Mellitus Female Humans Male Middle Aged Ontario Physician Incentive Plans/*statistics & numerical data Quality of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data"

The current study examined the association of both quantity and variety of F&V intake and risk of T2D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the 11-year incidence of T2D in relation to quantity and variety of fruit, vegetables, and combined F&V intake in a case-cohort study of 3,704 participants (n = 653 diabetes cases) nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Norfolk study, who completed 7-day prospective food diaries. Variety of intake was derived from the total number of different items consumed in a 1-week period. Multivariable, Prentice-weighted Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: A greater quantity of combined F&V intake was associated with 21% lower hazard of T2D (HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.62-1.00]) comparing extreme tertiles, in adjusted analyses including variety. Separately, quantity of vegetable intake (0.76 [0.60-0.97]), but not fruit, was inversely associated with T2D in adjusted analysis. Greater variety in fruit (0.70 [0.53-0.91]), vegetable (0.77 [0.61-0.98]), and combined F&V (0.61 [0.48-0.78]) intake was associated with a lower hazard of T2D, independent of known confounders and quantity of intake comparing extreme tertiles. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a diet characterized by a greater quantity of vegetables and a greater variety of both F&V intake is associated with a reduced risk of T2D.","Adult Aged Body Mass Index Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/diet therapy/*prevention & control Diet Records Eating Female *Fruit Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Nutrition Surveys Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors *Vegetables"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys completed in 2006, 2008 and 2010. Men aged >/= 76 years at the time of survey and without a prostate cancer diagnosis were included in the study. The percentage of men who had a PSA test in the year before the survey was computed separately for survey years 2006, 2008 and 2010. RESULTS: The estimated percentages of men with a PSA test in the year before the survey were 60% (95% CI: 58-62%), based on 9033 respondents interviewed in 2006, 63% (95% CI: 62-65%), based on 12,063 respondents interviewed in 2008, and 60% (95% CI: 59-61%), based on 14,782 respondents interviewed in 2010. CONCLUSION: No substantial reduction in the frequency of PSA testing was observed in the BRFSS 2010 survey data compared with the earlier years, suggesting that the USPSTF 2008 recommendation had no major impact on the frequency of PSA testing in older men in the USA.","Aged Aged, 80 and over *Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Guideline Adherence Humans Male Practice Guidelines as Topic Prostate-Specific Antigen/*blood Prostatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis United States"

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a contraceptive knowledge questionnaire that had been completed by 4144 women who were enrolled in the Contraceptive CHOICE Project before they received comprehensive contraceptive counseling and chose their method. For each contraceptive method, women were asked ""what percentage would get pregnant in a year: <1%, 1-5%, 6-10%, >10%, don't know."" RESULTS: Overall, 86% of subjects knew that the annual risk of pregnancy is >10% if no contraception is used. More than 45% of women overestimate the effectiveness of depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate, pills, the patch, the ring, and condoms. After adjustment for age, education, and contraceptive history, the data showed that women who chose the intrauterine device (adjusted relative risk, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 5.6-8.5) or implant (adjusted relative risk, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 4.7-7.3) were significantly more likely to identify the effectiveness of their method accurately compared with women who chose either the pill, patch, or ring.

METHODS: Individual data on 52 674 participants were pooled from 10 cohorts. Coronary heart disease events were analyzed in 22 437 participants from 6 cohorts with available data, and incident AF was analyzed in 8711 participants from 5 cohorts. Euthyroidism was defined as thyrotropin level between 0.45 and 4.49 mIU/L and endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism as thyrotropin level lower than 0.45 mIU/L with normal free thyroxine levels, after excluding those receiving thyroid-altering medications. RESULTS: Of 52 674 participants, 2188 (4.2%) had subclinical hyperthyroidism. During follow-up, 8527 participants died (including 1896 from CHD), 3653 of 22 437 had CHD events, and 785 of 8711 developed AF. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, subclinical hyperthyroidism was associated with increased total mortality (hazard ratio[HR], 1.24, 95% CI, 1.06-1.46), CHD mortality (HR,1.29; 95% CI, 1.02-1.62), CHD events (HR, 1.21; 95%CI, 0.99-1.46), and AF (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.16-2.43).Risks did not differ significantly by age, sex, or preexisting cardiovascular disease and were similar after further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, with attributable risk of 14.5% for total mortality to 41.5% forAF in those with subclinical hyperthyroidism. Risks for CHD mortality and AF (but not other outcomes) were higher for thyrotropin level lower than 0.10 mIU/L compared with thyrotropin level between 0.10 and 0.44 mIU/L(for both, P value for trend, .03). CONCLUSION: Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with increased risks of total, CHD mortality, and incident AF, with highest risks of CHD mortality and AF when thyrotropin level is lower than 0.10 mIU/L.","Adolescent Adult Age Distribution Aged Aged, 80 and over Atrial Fibrillation/complications/diagnosis/*mortality Cause of Death Cohort Studies Coronary Artery Disease/complications/diagnosis/*mortality Female Humans Hyperthyroidism/complications/*diagnosis/*mortality Male Middle Aged Prognosis Prospective Studies Risk Assessment Severity of Illness Index Sex Distribution Survival Analysis Switzerland Thyroid Function Tests Thyrotropin/*blood Young Adult"

Warmer temperatures accelerate growth and reproduction of ectotherms, whereas these processes are slowed or halted in colder temperatures. Female blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus inhabiting the Chesapeake Bay, exhibit a seasonal migratory behavior that is closely tied with spawning and the release of larvae. To better understand reproductive activities of the migratory adult females, we examined two reproductive parameters of these crabs sampled monthly (April-December, 2006): the levels of vitellogenin (VtG) in the hemolymph and VtG expression in the hepatopancreas and ovary. The full-length cDNA of VtG (CasVtG-ova) has been isolated from the ovary. The putative CasVtG sequence found in the ovary is >99% identical to that of the hepatopancreas and is related most closely to the sequences reported in other crab species. In female C. sapidus, the hepatopancreas produces over 99% of the total VtG toward the ovarian development. Ovarian stages 2 and 3 in the sampled females are characterized by significant high levels of VtG in hemolymph and VtG expression in both the hepatopancreas and ovary. However, during the southbound migration in fall, females at ovarian stages 2 and 3 have decreased VtG levels, compared to those in spring and summer. The decreased vitellogenesis activity during the fall migration suggests seasonal adaptation to ensure successful spawning and the larval release.",Missing

Using complete and reliable follow-up data from four phase III trials of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Melanoma Group, we explored the female advantage across multiple end points and in relation to other important prognostic indicators. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with localized melanoma were included in EORTC adjuvant treatment trials 18832, 18871, 18952, and 18961 and randomly assigned during the period of 1984 to 2005. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for women compared with men, adjusted for age, Breslow thickness, body site, ulceration, performed lymph node dissection, and treatment. RESULTS: A total of 2,672 patients with stage I/II melanoma were included. Women had a highly consistent and independent advantage in overall survival (adjusted HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.83), disease-specific survival (adjusted HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.88), time to lymph node metastasis (adjusted HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.96), and time to distant metastasis (adjusted HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.81). Subgroup analysis showed that the female advantage was consistent across all prognostic subgroups (with the possible exception of head and neck melanomas) and in pre- and postmenopausal age groups. CONCLUSION: Women have a consistent and independent relative advantage in all aspects of the progression of localized melanoma of approximately 30%, most likely caused by an underlying biologic sex difference.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Disease Progression Disease-Free Survival Female Humans Lymphatic Metastasis Male Melanoma/mortality/*pathology/therapy Middle Aged Prognosis *Sex Characteristics Skin Neoplasms/mortality/*pathology/therapy Treatment Outcome Young Adult"
22513194,Increased risk of mortality and readmission among patients discharged against medical advice.,Am J Med,Southern WN and Nahvi S and Arnsten JH,montefiore,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 500,000 patients are discharged from US hospitals against medical advice annually, but the associated risks are unknown. METHODS: We examined 148,810 discharges from an urban, academic health system between July 1, 2002 and June 30, 2008. Of these, 3544 (2.4%) were discharged against medical advice, and 80,536 (54.1%) were discharged home. We excluded inpatient deaths, transfers to other hospitals or nursing facilities or discharges with home care. Using adjusted and propensity score-matched analyses, we compared 30-day mortality, 30-day readmission, and length of stay between discharges against medical advice and planned discharges. RESULTS: Discharge against medical advice was associated with higher mortality than planned discharge, after adjustment (odds ratio [OR](adj) 2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-2.86), and in propensity-matched analysis (OR(matched) 2.46; 95% CI, 1.29-4.68). Discharge against medical advice also was associated with higher 30-day readmission after adjustment (OR(adj) 1.84; 95% CI, 1.69-2.01), and in propensity-matched analysis (OR(matched) 1.65; 95% CI, 1.46-1.87).

22552923,Preservation of 5300 year old red blood cells in the Iceman.,J R Soc Interface,Janko M and Stark RW and Zink A,Missing,"Changes in elasticity and structures of red blood cells (RBCs) are important indicators of disease, and this makes them interesting for medical studies. In forensics, blood analyses represent a crucial part of crime scene investigations. For these reasons, the recovery and analysis of blood cells from ancient tissues is of major interest. In this study, we show that RBCs were preserved in Iceman tissue samples for more than 5000 years. The morphological and molecular composition of the blood corpuscle is verified by atomic force microscope and Raman spectroscopy measurements. The cell size and shape approximated those of healthy, dried, recent RBCs. Raman spectra of the ancient corpuscle revealed bands that are characteristic of haemoglobin. Additional vibrational modes typical for other proteinaceous fragments, possibly fibrin, suggested the formation of a blood clot. The band intensities, however, were approximately an order of magnitude weaker than those of recent RBCs. This fact points to a decrease in the RBC-specific metalloprotein haemoglobin and, thus, to a degradation of the cells. Together, the results show the preservation of RBCs in the 5000 year old mummy tissue and give the first insights into their degradation.","Erythrocytes/*chemistry/ultrastructure Hemoglobins/analysis/*chemistry Humans Microscopy, Atomic Force *Mummies Spectrum Analysis, Raman"

However, no single specific farm-related exposure explaining this protective farm effect has consistently been identified. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine distinct farm exposures that account for the protective effect of farming on asthma and atopy. METHODS: In rural regions of Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, 79,888 school-aged children answered a recruiting questionnaire (phase I). In phase II a stratified random subsample of 8,419 children answered a detailed questionnaire on farming environment. Blood samples and specific IgE levels were available for 7,682 of these children. A broad asthma definition was used, comprising symptoms, diagnosis, or treatment ever. RESULTS: Children living on a farm were at significantly reduced risk of asthma (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.59-0.78; P< .001), hay fever (aOR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.36-0.52; P< .001), atopic dermatitis (aOR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69-0.93; P= .004), and atopic sensitization (aOR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.48-0.61; P< .001) compared with nonfarm children. Whereas this overall farm effect could be explained by specific exposures to cows, straw, and farm milk for asthma and exposure to fodder storage rooms and manure for atopic dermatitis, the farm effect on hay fever and atopic sensitization could not be completely explained by the questionnaire items themselves or their diversity. CONCLUSION: A specific type of farm typical for traditional farming (ie, with cows and cultivation) was protective against asthma, hay fever, and atopy. However, whereas the farm effect on asthma could be explained by specific farm characteristics, there is a link still missing for hay fever and atopy.","Agriculture Animals Asthma/*epidemiology/*prevention & control Austria Cats Cattle Child Dogs *Environmental Exposure Germany Humans Hypersensitivity, Immediate/*epidemiology/*prevention & control Immunoglobulin E/blood Poland Poultry Prevalence Questionnaires Rural Population Sheep Swine Switzerland"
22722205,Experimental adaptation of an influenza H5 HA confers respiratory droplet transmission to a reassortant H5 HA/H1N1 virus in ferrets.,Nature,Imai M and Watanabe T and Hatta M and Das SC and Ozawa M and Shinya K and Zhong G and Hanson A and Katsura H and Watanabe S and Li C and Kawakami E and Yamada S and Kiso M and Suzuki Y and Maher EA and Neumann G and Kawaoka Y,Missing,"Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza A viruses occasionally infect humans, but currently do not transmit efficiently among humans. The viral haemagglutinin (HA) protein is a known host-range determinant as it mediates virus binding to host-specific cellular receptors. Here we assess the molecular changes in HA that would allow a virus possessing subtype H5 HA to be transmissible among mammals. We identified a reassortant H5 HA/H1N1 virus-comprising H5 HA (from an H5N1 virus) with four mutations and the remaining seven gene segments from a 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus-that was capable of droplet transmission in a ferret model. The transmissible H5 reassortant virus preferentially recognized human-type receptors, replicated efficiently in ferrets, caused lung lesions and weight loss, but was not highly pathogenic and did not cause mortality. These results indicate that H5 HA can convert to an HA that supports efficient viral transmission in mammals; however, we do not know whether the four mutations in the H5 HA identified here would render a wholly avian H5N1 virus transmissible. The genetic origin of the remaining seven viral gene segments may also critically contribute to transmissibility in mammals. Nevertheless, as H5N1 viruses continue to evolve and infect humans, receptor-binding variants of H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential, including avian-human reassortant viruses as tested here, may emerge. Our findings emphasize the need to prepare for potential pandemics caused by influenza viruses possessing H5 HA, and will help individuals conducting surveillance in regions with circulating H5N1 viruses to recognize key residues that predict the pandemic potential of isolates, which will inform the development, production and distribution of effective countermeasures.","Adaptation, Physiological/*genetics Animals Bioterrorism/prevention & control Birds/virology Body Fluids/virology Cell Line Dogs Evolution, Molecular Female Ferrets/*virology HEK293 Cells HeLa Cells Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus/genetics/metabolism Hot Temperature Humans Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/genetics/pathogenicity/physiology Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology Influenza in Birds/transmission/virology Influenza, Human/prevention & control/transmission/virology Molecular Epidemiology/methods Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*transmission/*virology Pandemics Population Surveillance/methods Protein Stability Reassortant Viruses/genetics/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity/physiology Receptors, Virus/chemistry/metabolism Respiratory System/anatomy & histology/*virology Security Measures Zoonoses/transmission/virology"

STUDY DESIGN: Fifty-four triplets (19 sets, mean [SD] gestational age 32.0 [2.4] weeks, birth weight 1580 [450] g) and 51 gestational age-, birth weight-, and sex-matched singleton controls self-rated their HRQoL at age 14.5 (0.3) years. Proxy reports about HRQoL and behavior were obtained by parents and teachers. HRQoL was measured with the Kidscreen-52 questionnaire child and parent form, and behavior with the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist. RESULTS: Self- and parent-reported HRQoL values was similar in both groups except for the dimensions ""mood and emotions"" and ""autonomy,"" which were better (P = .001, P = .03) in triplets. Parents reported significantly less behavioral problems in triplets compared with controls. Compared with community norms, both HRQoL and behavior measures in triplets were in the normal range. Parent-reported HRQoL was predicted by dichorionicity. CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL and behavioral outcome in adolescent triplets was good in our study and was, in some aspects, better than in matched singleton controls. Dichorionicity is an important outcome determinant.","Adolescent *Adolescent Behavior Female Humans Male Parents/psychology Prospective Studies *Quality of Life Regression Analysis Social Class Stress, Psychological *Triplets/psychology"

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Eight IVF centers. PATIENT(S): A total of 2,134 couples who began IVF treatment in the centers in 2000-2002 and were followed up by a postal questionnaire sent 7-9 years after they started treatment in the inclusion center. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Rates of BSP and factors associated with BSP. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using logistic regression. RESULT(S): The BSP rate was 17% (218/1,320) among couples who had previously had a child through medical treatment and 24% (193/814) among couples who had remained childless after treatment. In both groups, the probability of BSP was higher among younger women and increased with a smaller number of IVF attempts. Probability was also higher when the cause of infertility was unexplained. CONCLUSION(S): Our results should give hope to couples who have been unsuccessfully treated by IVF, especially young couples with unexplained infertility. Nonetheless, it should be remembered that the BSP rates are cumulative rates observed over a long period of time and that these couples have a very low monthly probability of conceiving.","Adult Cohort Studies *Family Characteristics Female *Fertilization in Vitro/statistics & numerical data France/epidemiology Humans Infertility/*rehabilitation/*therapy Live Birth/epidemiology Male Pregnancy Pregnancy Rate Remission, Spontaneous Retrospective Studies"
22516528,Usefulness of desirable lifestyle factors to attenuate the risk of heart failure among offspring whose parents had myocardial infarction before age 55 years.,Am J Cardiol,Khawaja O and Kotler G and Gaziano JM and Djousse L,Missing,"Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization and death in the United States and throughout Europe. Although a higher risk for HF with antecedent myocardial infarction (MI) has been reported in offspring whose parents had MIs before age 55 years, it is unclear whether adherence to healthful behaviors can mitigate that risk. The aim of the present study was therefore to prospectively examine if adherence to healthy weight, regular exercise, moderate alcohol consumption, and abstinence from smoking can attenuate such increased HF risk. Information on parental history of MI and lifestyle factors was collected using questionnaires. Subjects adhering to >/=3 healthy lifestyle factors were classified as having good versus poor lifestyle scores. Incident HF was assessed via yearly follow-up questionnaires and validated in a subsample. During an average follow up of 21.7 +/- 6.5 years, 1,323 new HF cases (6.6%), of which 190 (14.4%) were preceded by MI, occurred. Compared to subjects with good lifestyle scores and no parental histories of premature MI, multivariate adjusted hazard ratios for incident HF with antecedent MI were 3.21 (95% confidence interval 1.74 to 5.91) for subjects with good lifestyle score and parental histories of premature MI, 1.52 (95% confidence interval 1.12 to 2.07) for those with poor lifestyle score and no parental histories of premature MI, and 4.60 (95% confidence interval 2.55 to 8.30) for those with poor lifestyle scores and parental histories of premature MI. In conclusion, our data suggest that even in subjects at higher risk for HF because of genetic predisposition, adherence to healthful lifestyle factors may attenuate such an elevated HF risk.","Adult Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Heart Failure/*genetics/*prevention & control Humans *Life Style Middle Aged Myocardial Infarction/*genetics Patient Compliance/*statistics & numerical data Prospective Studies Risk Factors"

STUDY DESIGN: We mailed a survey to a nationally representative sample of 1800 practicing obstetrician-gynecologists. RESULTS: The response rate was 66%. Among obstetrician-gynecologists who practice in religiously affiliated institutions, 37% have had a conflict with their institution over religiously based policies. These conflicts are most common in Catholic institutions (52%; adjusted odds ratio, 8.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-46.2). Few reported that their options for treating ectopic pregnancy are limited by their hospitals (2.5% at non-Catholic institutions vs 5.5% at Catholic institutions; P = .07). CONCLUSION: Many obstetrician-gynecologists who practice in religiously affiliated institutions have had conflicts over religiously based policies.

22502956,Alternative smoking cessation aids: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,Am J Med,Tahiri M and Mottillo S and Joseph L and Pilote L and Eisenberg MJ,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture, hypnotherapy, and aversive smoking are the most frequently studied alternative smoking cessation aids. These aids are often used as alternatives to pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation; however, their efficacy is unclear. METHODS: We carried out a random effect meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to determine the efficacy of alternative smoking cessation aids. We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO databases through December 2010. We only included trials that reported cessation outcomes as point prevalence or continuous abstinence at 6 or 12 months. RESULTS: Fourteen trials were identified; 6 investigated acupuncture (823 patients); 4 investigated hypnotherapy (273 patients); and 4 investigated aversive smoking (99 patients). The estimated mean treatment effects were acupuncture (odds ratio [OR], 3.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-12.07), hypnotherapy (OR, 4.55; 95% CI, 0.98-21.01), and aversive smoking (OR, 4.26; 95% CI, 1.26-14.38). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that acupuncture and hypnotherapy may help smokers quit. Aversive smoking also may help smokers quit; however, there are no recent trials investigating this intervention.

DESIGN: Meta-analysis comparing study effects using four summary estimates. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Cochrane Library, online clinical trials registries, and reference lists of identified articles. REVIEW METHODS: We included randomised controlled trials of current tobacco users of adult age comparing use of varenicline with an inactive control and reporting adverse events. We defined treatment emergent, cardiovascular serious adverse events as occurring during drug treatment or within 30 days of discontinuation, and included any ischaemic or arrhythmic adverse cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary revascularisation, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, transient ischaemic attacks, stroke, sudden death or cardiovascular related death, or congestive heart failure). RESULTS: We identified 22 trials; all were double blinded and placebo controlled; two included participants with active cardiovascular disease and 11 enrolled participants with a history of cardiovascular disease. Rates of treatment emergent, cardiovascular serious adverse events were 0.63% (34/5431) in the varenicline groups and 0.47% (18/3801) in the placebo groups. The summary estimate for the risk difference, 0.27% (95% confidence interval -0.10 to 0.63; P = 0.15), based on all 22 trials, was neither clinically nor statistically significant. For comparison, the relative risk (1.40, 0.82 to 2.39; P = 0.22), Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (1.41, 0.82 to 2.42; P = 0.22), and Peto odds ratio (1.58, 0.90 to 2.76; P = 0.11), all based on 14 trials with at least one event, also indicated a non-significant difference between varenicline and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: This meta--analysis--which included all trials published to date, focused on events occurring during drug exposure, and analysed findings using four summary estimates-found no significant increase in cardiovascular serious adverse events associated with varenicline use. For rare outcomes, summary estimates based on absolute effects are recommended and estimates based on the Peto odds ratio should be avoided.",Adult Benzazepines/*adverse effects Cardiovascular Diseases/*chemically induced Female Humans Male Nicotinic Agonists/*adverse effects Quinoxalines/*adverse effects Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Risk Factors Tobacco Use Cessation/*methods Tobacco Use Disorder/drug therapy Treatment Outcome
22566526,Zinc for the treatment of the common cold: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,CMAJ,Science M and Johnstone J and Roth DE and Guyatt G and Loeb M,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Results of randomized controlled trials evaluating zinc for the treatment of the common cold are conflicting. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zinc for such use. METHODS: We searched electronic databases and other sources for studies published through to Sept. 30, 2011. We included all randomized controlled trials comparing orally administered zinc with placebo or no treatment. Assessment for study inclusion, data extraction and risk-of-bias analyses were performed in duplicate. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model. RESULTS: We included 17 trials involving a total of 2121 participants. Compared with patients given placebo, those receiving zinc had a shorter duration of cold symptoms (mean difference -1.65 days, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.50 to -0.81); however, heterogeneity was high (I(2) = 95%). Zinc shortened the duration of cold symptoms in adults (mean difference -2.63, 95% CI -3.69 to -1.58), but no significant effect was seen among children (mean difference -0.26, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.25). Heterogeneity remained high in all subgroup analyses, including by age, dose of ionized zinc and zinc formulation. The occurrence of any adverse event (risk ratio [RR] 1.24, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.46), bad taste (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.16) and nausea (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.27) were more common in the zinc group than in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: The results of our meta-analysis showed that oral zinc formulations may shorten the duration of symptoms of the common cold. However, large high-quality trials are needed before definitive recommendations for clinical practice can be made. Adverse effects were common and should be the point of future study, because a good safety and tolerance profile is essential when treating this generally mild illness.","Administration, Oral Common Cold/*drug therapy Humans Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Time Factors Trace Elements/*therapeutic use Treatment Outcome Zinc/*therapeutic use"
22566562,The antisocial brain: psychopathy matters.,Arch Gen Psychiatry,Gregory S and ffytche D and Simmons A and Kumari V and Howard M and Hodgins S and Blackwood N,Missing,"CONTEXT: The population of men who display persistent antisocial and violent behavior is heterogeneous. Callous-unemotional traits in childhood and psychopathic traits in adulthood characterize a distinct subgroup. OBJECTIVE: To identify structural gray matter (GM) differences between persistent violent offenders who meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder and the syndrome of psychopathy (ASPDP) and those meeting criteria only for ASPD (ASPD-P). DESIGN: Cross-sectional case-control structural magnetic resonance imaging study. SETTING: Inner-city probation services and neuroimaging research unit in London, England. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-six men, including 17 violent offenders with ASPDP, 27 violent offenders with ASPD-P, and 22 healthy nonoffenders participated in the study. Forensic clinicians assessed participants using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gray matter volumes as assessed by structural magnetic resonance imaging and volumetric voxel-based morphometry analyses. RESULTS: Offenders with ASPDP displayed significantly reduced GM volumes bilaterally in the anterior rostral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10) and temporal poles (Brodmann area 20/38) relative to offenders with ASPD-P and nonoffenders. These reductions were not attributable to substance use disorders. Offenders with ASPD-P exhibited GM volumes similar to the nonoffenders. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced GM volume within areas implicated in empathic processing, moral reasoning, and processing of prosocial emotions such as guilt and embarrassment may contribute to the profound abnormalities of social behavior observed in psychopathy. Evidence of robust structural brain differences between persistently violent men with and without psychopathy adds to the evidence that psychopathy represents a distinct phenotype. This knowledge may facilitate research into the etiology of persistent violent behavior.","Adult Antisocial Personality Disorder/diagnosis/*physiopathology/psychology Brain Mapping Case-Control Studies Cerebral Cortex/*physiopathology Cross-Sectional Studies Dominance, Cerebral/physiology Emotions/physiology Empathy/physiology Humans *Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted *Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Organ Size/physiology Prefrontal Cortex/physiopathology Prisoners/*psychology Reference Values Temporal Lobe/physiopathology Violence/*psychology Young Adult"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Low-income community sample from suburban Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)/urban pediatric clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eighty-one mother-toddler dyads (toddlers: 54.1% male; mean age, 20.2 months; 70.8% African American; 8.5% underweight [<15th weight-for-length percentile]; and 29.2% overweight [>/=85th weight-for-length percentile]). MAIN EXPOSURE: Measured anthropometry (mother/toddler) and demographics. OUTCOME MEASURE: Validated toddler silhouette scale (accuracy and satisfaction). RESULTS: Nearly 70% of mothers were inaccurate in assessing their toddler's body size. Compared with mothers of healthy-weight toddlers, mothers of underweight toddlers were 9.13 times more likely to be accurate (95% CI, 2.94-28.36) and mothers of overweight toddlers were 87% less likely to be accurate (95% CI, 0.05-0.33); accuracy did not differ by toddler age, sex, or race or mother's education or weight status. More than 70% of all mothers and 81.7% of mothers of overweight toddlers were satisfied with their toddler's body size. Accurate mothers of underweight toddlers were less likely to be satisfied than accurate mothers of healthy-weight toddlers (30.0% vs 76.8%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Mothers of overweight toddlers had inaccurate perceptions of their toddler's body size and were highly satisfied, suggesting a view of heavy toddlers as normative. Mothers of underweight toddlers had accurate perceptions yet were dissatisfied, suggesting recognition of their child as outside the norm. Because inaccurate perceptions begin early in toddlerhood, pediatric providers should help improve families' understanding of healthy body size. Future studies should examine how satisfaction and accuracy relate to parenting behaviors.","Adolescent Adult *Attitude to Health Body Size Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Female Humans Infant Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Models, Psychological Mothers/*psychology Multivariate Analysis Overweight/*psychology *Personal Satisfaction Poverty Questionnaires *Size Perception Socioeconomic Factors Thinness/*psychology Young Adult"
22566563,Mania with and without depression in a community sample of US adolescents.,Arch Gen Psychiatry,Merikangas KR and Cui L and Kattan G and Carlson GA and Youngstrom EA and Angst J,nih,"CONTEXT: There are limited data on the manifestations of mania in general community samples of adolescents. OBJECTIVE: To present the prevalence and clinical correlates of mania with and without depressive episodes in a representative sample of US adolescents. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of adolescents using a modified version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. PARTICIPANTS: Ten thousand one hundred twentythree adolescents aged 13 to 18 years identified in household and school settings. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mania/hypomania with or without depression among those who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I or II disorder or major depressive disorder. RESULTS: Two and a half percent of youth met criteria for lifetime bipolar I or II disorder and 1.7%, for mania only. Twelve-month rates of mania with and without depression were 2.2% and 1.3%, respectively. There was a nearly 2-fold increase in rates of mania from ages 13-14 to 17-18 years. Mania with depression was associated with a greater number of all indictors of clinical severity including symptom number and severity, role disability, severe impairment, comorbidity, and treatment compared with depression alone, whereas correlates of mania were similar among those with mania with or without depression. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing prevalence of bipolar disorder with increasing age and the comparable rate of bipolar disorder with those of adult samples highlight adolescence as the peak period of onset of mania. The clinical significance of mania plus depression as demonstrated by a 1 in 5 suicide attempt rate and nearly 2 months per year of role impairment in adolescence has important implications for early intervention. The evidence for independence of mania from depression warrants additional scrutiny in the diagnostic nomenclature and etiologic dissection of bipolar disorder.","Adolescent Age Factors Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology Comorbidity Cross-Sectional Studies Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology Female Health Surveys Humans Male United States"
22566505,Increased cerebral metabolism after 1 year of deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer disease.,Arch Neurol,Smith GS and Laxton AW and Tang-Wai DF and McAndrews MP and Diaconescu AO and Workman CI and Lozano AM,jhmi,"BACKGROUND: The importance of developing unique, neural circuitry-based treatments for the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD) was the impetus for a phase I study of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with AD that targeted the fornix. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that DBS would increase cerebral glucose metabolism in cortical and hippocampal circuits and that increased metabolism would be correlated with better clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Open-label trial. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: A total of 5 patients with mild, probable AD (1 woman and 4 men, with a mean [SD] age of 62.6 [4.2] years). INTERVENTION: Deep brain stimulation of the fornix. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All patients underwent clinical follow-up and high-resolution positron emission tomography studies of cerebral glucose metabolism after 1 year of DBS. RESULTS: Functional connectivity analyses revealed that 1 year of DBS increased cerebral glucose metabolism in 2 orthogonal networks: a frontal-temporal-parietal-striatal-thalamic network and a frontal-temporal-parietal-occipital-hippocampal network. In similar cortical regions, higher baseline metabolism prior to DBS and increased metabolism after 1 year of DBS were correlated with better outcomes in global cognition, memory, and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Increased connectivity after 1 year of DBS is observed, which is in contrast to the decreased connectivity observed over the course of AD. The persistent cortical metabolic increases after 1 year of DBS were associated with better clinical outcomes in this patient sample and are greater in magnitude and more extensive in the effects on cortical circuitry compared with the effects reported for pharmacotherapy over 1 year in AD.","Aged Alzheimer Disease/*metabolism/radionuclide imaging/*therapy Brain/*metabolism/radionuclide imaging Brain Mapping Cognition/physiology *Deep Brain Stimulation Female Fornix, Brain/*metabolism/radionuclide imaging Humans Male Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Treatment Outcome"

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients 21 years and older who were admitted to our tertiary care center with chest pain in 2007 and 2008. Using electronic records and chart review, we sought (1) to identify differences in the use of stress testing based on patient demographics and comorbidities, pretest probability of coronary artery disease, and house staff coverage and (2) to describe the results of stress testing and patient outcomes, including revascularization procedures and 30-day readmissions for myocardial infarction. RESULTS: Of 2107 patients, 1474 (69.9%) underwent stress tests, and the results were abnormal in 184 patients (12.5%). Within 30 days, 22 patients (11.6%) with abnormal test results underwent cardiac catheterization, 9 (4.7%) underwent revascularization, and 2 (1.1%) were readmitted for myocardial infarction. In a multivariable model, stress test ordering was positively associated with age younger than 70 years (RR [relative risk], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02-1.23), private insurance (vs Medicare/Medicaid: RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11-1.27), and no house staff coverage (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.28-1.50). Of patients with low (<10%) pretest probability, 68.0% underwent stress testing, but only 4.5% of these had abnormal test results. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients who are admitted with low-risk chest pain undergo stress testing, regardless of pretest probability, but abnormal test results are uncommon and rarely acted on. Ordering stress tests based on pretest probability could improve efficiency without endangering patients.","Adult Aged Analysis of Variance Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary/statistics & numerical data Chest Pain/*etiology Cohort Studies Comorbidity Coronary Artery Bypass/statistics & numerical data Coronary Artery Disease/*complications/*diagnosis/physiopathology/therapy Electrocardiography Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data Exercise Test/*statistics & numerical data Female Humans Internship and Residency Male Medical Records Systems, Computerized Middle Aged Myocardial Infarction/*complications/*diagnosis/physiopathology/therapy Myocardial Revascularization/*statistics & numerical data Outcome Assessment (Health Care) Patient Readmission/statistics & numerical data Poisson Distribution Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Risk Factors United States/epidemiology Unnecessary Procedures/*statistics & numerical data"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body fat distribution (assessed by computed tomography) was assessed before the intervention (PRE) and 2 months (POST2), and 6 months (POST6) after surgery. Secondary outcome measures included body composition, metabolic parameters and dietary intake, assessed at PRE, POST2, and POST6, and total energy expenditure, physical capacity, and sc adipocyte size and lipid metabolism-related gene expression, assessed at PRE and POST6. RESULTS: Liposuction was effective in reducing sc abdominal fat (PRE vs. POST2, P = 0.0001). Despite the sustained sc abdominal fat decrement at POST6 (P = 0.0001), the NT group showed a significant 10% increase in visceral fat from PRE to POST6 (P = 0.04; effect size = -0.72) and decreased energy expenditure (P = 0.01; effect size = 0.95) when compared with TR. Dietary intake, adipocyte size, and gene expression were unchanged over time. CONCLUSION: Abdominal liposuction does not induce regrowth of fat, but it does trigger a compensatory increase of visceral fat, which is effectively counteracted by physical activity.",Adult Body Composition/physiology Combined Modality Therapy Eating/physiology Energy Metabolism/physiology Exercise Therapy Female Humans Intra-Abdominal Fat/metabolism/*pathology Lipectomy/*adverse effects/rehabilitation Motor Activity/*physiology Obesity/epidemiology/metabolism/pathology/therapy Patient Compliance/statistics & numerical data Postoperative Complications/*etiology/*therapy Postoperative Period Treatment Outcome Up-Regulation *Weight Gain/physiology Young Adult

DESIGN Group randomized controlled trial with 12-month follow-up. SETTING Twelve secondary schools in low-income communities in the Hunter and Central Coast regions of New South Wales, Australia. PARTICIPANTS Three hundred fifty-seven adolescent girls aged 12 to 14 years. INTERVENTION A multicomponent school-based intervention program tailored for adolescent girls. The intervention was based on social cognitive theory and included teacher professional development, enhanced school sport sessions, interactive seminars, nutrition workshops, lunch-time physical activity sessions, handbooks and pedometers for self-monitoring, parent newsletters, and text messaging for social support. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), BMI z score, body fat percentage, physical activity, screen time, dietary intake, and self-esteem. RESULTS After 12 months, changes in BMI (adjusted mean difference, -0.19; 95% CI, -0.70 to 0.33), BMI z score (mean, -0.08; 95% CI, -0.20 to 0.04), and body fat percentage (mean, -1.09; 95% CI, -2.88 to 0.70) were in favor of the intervention, but they were not statistically different from those in the control group. Changes in screen time were statistically significant (mean, -30.67 min/d; 95% CI, -62.43 to -1.06), but there were no group by time effects for physical activity, dietary behavior, or self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS A school-based intervention tailored for adolescent girls from schools located in low-income communities did not significantly reduce BMI gain. However, changes in body composition were of a magnitude similar to previous studies and may be associated with clinically important health outcomes.

DESIGN A cross-sectional study evaluated underage alcohol purchase attempts from 100 popular Internet vendors. SETTING The study was conducted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, July 14-27, 2011. PARTICIPANTS Eight 18- to 20-year-old individuals participated. OUTCOME MEASURES Rates of successful sales to minors and use of age verification procedures at order and delivery were determined. RESULTS Of the 100 orders placed by the underage buyers, 45% were successfully received; 28% were rejected as the result of age verification. Most vendors (59%) used weak, if any, age verification at the point of order, and, of 45 successful orders, 23 (51%) used none. Age verification at delivery was inconsistently conducted and, when attempted, failed about half of the time. CONCLUSIONS Age verification procedures used by Internet alcohol vendors do not adequately prevent online sales to minors. Shipping companies should work with their staff to improve administration of age verification at delivery, and vendors should use rigorous age verification at order and delivery. Further research should determine the proportion of minors who buy alcohol online and test purchases from more vendors to inform enforcement of existing policies and creation of new policies to reduce youth access to alcohol online.",Missing
22513196,Fish consumption and colorectal cancer risk in humans: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Am J Med,Wu S and Feng B and Li K and Zhu X and Liang S and Liu X and Han S and Wang B and Wu K and Miao D and Liang J and Fan D,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Fish consumption may protect against colorectal cancer, but results from observational studies are inconsistent; therefore, a systematic review with a meta-analysis was conducted. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by a search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to May 2011, with no restrictions. Reference lists from retrieved articles also were reviewed. Studies that reported odds ratio (OR) or relative risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between the consumption of fish and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer were included. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. The risk estimate (hazard ratio, relative risk, or OR) of the highest and lowest reported categories of fish intake were extracted from each study and analyzed using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-two prospective cohort and 19 case-control studies on fish consumption and colorectal cancer risk met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Our analysis found that fish consumption decreased the risk of colorectal cancer by 12% (summary OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80-0.95). The pooled ORs of colorectal cancer for the highest versus lowest fish consumption in case-control studies and cohort studies were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72-0.95) and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.86-1.01), respectively. There was heterogeneity among case-control studies (P<.001) but not among cohort studies. A significant inverse association was found between fish intake and rectal cancer (summary OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97), and there was a modest trend seen between fish consumption and colon cancer (summary OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.81-1.14). This study had no publication bias.

22534203,Are children with birth defects at higher risk of childhood cancers?,Am J Epidemiol,Carozza SE and Langlois PH and Miller EA and Canfield M,oregonstate,"Birth defects may influence the risk of childhood cancer development through a variety of mechanisms. The rarity of both birth defects and childhood cancers makes it challenging to study these associations, particularly for the very rare instances of each. To address this limitation, the authors conducted a record linkage-based cohort study among Texas children born between 1996 and 2005. Birth defects in the cohort were identified through the Texas Birth Defects Registry, and children who developed cancer were identified by using record linkage with Texas Cancer Registry data. Over 3 million birth records were included; 115,686 subjects had birth defects, and there were 2,351 cancer cases. Overall, children with a birth defect had a 3-fold increased risk of developing cancer (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 3.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.65, 3.50), with germ cell tumors (IRR = 5.19, 95% CI: 2.67, 9.41), retinoblastomas (IRR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.21, 4.16), soft-tissue sarcomas (IRR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.09, 3.79), and leukemias (IRR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.75) having statistically significant elevated point estimates. All birth defect groups except for musculoskeletal had increased cancer incidence. Untangling the strong relation between birth defects and childhood cancers could lead to a better understanding of the genetic and environmental factors that affect both conditions.","Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies *Congenital Abnormalities Female Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology Male Maternal Age Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/epidemiology/etiology Proportional Hazards Models Registries Retinoblastoma/epidemiology/etiology Risk Sarcoma/epidemiology/etiology Texas"

OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the association between poor asthma control and in utero smoking and current SHS exposure among Latino and black children with asthma. METHODS: We performed a case-only analysis of 2 multicenter case-control studies conducted from 2008-2010 with similar protocols. We recruited 2481 Latino and black subjects with asthma (ages 8-17 years) from the mainland United States and Puerto Rico. Ordinal logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of in utero smoking and current SHS exposures on National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-defined asthma control. RESULTS: Poor asthma control among children 8 to 17 years of age was independently associated with in utero smoking (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0).

22631865,Rapid repeat pregnancy in adolescents: do immediate postpartum contraceptive implants make a difference?,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Tocce KM and Sheeder JL and Teal SB,ucdenver,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine contraceptive continuation and repeat pregnancy rates in adolescents who are offered immediate postpartum etonogestrel implant (IPI) insertion. STUDY DESIGN: Participants in an adolescent prenatal-postnatal program were enrolled in a prospective observational study of IPI insertion (IPI group, 171) vs other methods (control group, 225). Contraceptive continuation and repeat pregnancies were determined. RESULTS: Implant continuation at 6 months was 96.9% (156/161 participants); at 12 months, the continuation rate was 86.3% (132/153 participants). At 6 months, 9.9% of the control participants were pregnant (21/213); there were no IPI pregnancies. By 12 months, 18.6% of control participants (38/204) experienced pregnancy vs 2.6% of IPI recipients (4/153; relative risk, 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-12.7). Repeat pregnancy at 12 months was predicted by not receiving IPI insertion (odds ratio, 8.0; 95% CI, 2.8-23.0) and having >1 child (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-4.3; P = .03). CONCLUSION: IPI placement in adolescents has excellent continuation 1 year after delivery; rapid repeat pregnancy is significantly decreased compared with control participants.","Adolescent Contraception/methods/*utilization Contraceptive Agents, Female/*administration & dosage Desogestrel/*administration & dosage Drug Implants Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Logistic Models *Postpartum Period Pregnancy/*statistics & numerical data Prospective Studies Time Factors Young Adult"

22585766,Postsecondary education and employment among youth with an autism spectrum disorder.,Pediatrics,Shattuck PT and Narendorf SC and Cooper B and Sterzing PR and Wagner M and Taylor JL,wustl,"OBJECTIVES: We examined the prevalence and correlates of postsecondary education and employment among youth with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). METHODS: Data were from a nationally representative survey of parents, guardians, and young adults with an ASD. Participation in postsecondary employment, college, or vocational education and lack of participation in any of these activities were examined. Rates were compared with those of youth in 3 other eligibility categories: speech/language impairment, learning disability, and mental retardation. Logistic regression was used to examine correlates of each outcome. RESULTS: For youth with an ASD, 34.7% had attended college and 55.1% had held paid employment during the first 6 years after high school. More than 50% of youth who had left high school in the past 2 years had no participation in employment or education. Youth with an ASD had the lowest rates of participation in employment and the highest rates of no participation compared with youth in other disability categories. Higher income and higher functional ability were associated with higher adjusted odds of participation in postsecondary employment and education. CONCLUSIONS: Youth with an ASD have poor postsecondary employment and education outcomes, especially in the first 2 years after high school. Those from lower-income families and those with greater functional impairments are at heightened risk for poor outcomes. Further research is needed to understand how transition planning before high school exit can facilitate a better connection to productive postsecondary activities.","Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/diagnosis/*epidemiology Educational Status Employment/*trends Female Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Universities/trends Vocational Education/*trends Young Adult"

This study was performed to determine whether acupuncture is superior to placebo needling in improving DOE in patients with COPD who are receiving standard medication. METHODS: Sixty-eight of 111 patients from the Kansai region of Japan who were diagnosed as having COPD and were receiving standard medication participated in a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial (July 1, 2006, through March 31, 2009) in which the patients, evaluators, and statistician were unaware of the random allocation. Participants were randomly assigned to traditional acupuncture (real acupuncture group, n=34) or placebo needling (placebo acupuncture group, n=34). Both groups received real or placebo needling at the same acupoints once a week for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the modified Borg scale score evaluated immediately after the 6-minute walk test. Measurements were obtained at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. RESULT: After 12 weeks, the Borg scale score after the 6-minute walk test was significantly better in the real acupuncture group compared with the placebo acupuncture group (mean [SD] difference from baseline by analysis of covariance, -3.6 [1.9] vs 0.4 [1.2]; mean difference between groups by analysis of covariance, -3.58; 95% CI, -4.27 to -2.90). Patients with COPD who received real acupuncture also experienced improvement in the 6-minute walk distance during exercise, indicating better exercise tolerance and reduced DOE. CONCLUSION: This study clearly demonstrates that acupuncture is a useful adjunctive therapy in reducing DOE in patients with COPD.

22585889,Intranasal corticosteroids in management of acute sinusitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Ann Fam Med,Hayward G and Heneghan C and Perera R and Thompson M,Missing,"PURPOSE: Acute sinusitis is a common condition in ambulatory care, where it is frequently treated with antibiotics, despite little evidence of their benefit. Intranasal corticosteroids might relieve symptoms; however, evidence for this benefit is currently unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of intranasal corticosteroids on the symptoms of acute sinusitis. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases until February 2011 for studies comparing intranasal corticosteroids with placebo in children or adults having clinical symptoms and signs of acute sinusitis or rhinosinusitis in ambulatory settings. We excluded chronic/allergic sinusitis. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the studies' methodologic quality. RESULTS: We included 6 studies having a total of 2,495 patients. In 5 studies, antibiotics were prescribed in addition to corticosteroids or placebo. Intranasal corticosteroids resulted in a significant, small increase in resolution of or improvement in symptoms at days 14 to 21 (risk difference [RD] = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.03-0.13). Analysis of individual symptom scores revealed most consistently significant benefits for facial pain and congestion. Subgroup analysis by time of reported outcomes showed a significant beneficial effect at 21 days (RD = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06-0.17), but not at 14 to 15 days (RD = 0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.11). Meta-regression analysis of trials using different doses of mometasone furoate showed a significant dose-response relationship (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal corticosteroids offer a small therapeutic benefit in acute sinusitis, which may be greater with high doses and with courses of 21 days' duration. Further trials are needed in antibiotic-naive patients.","Acute Disease Administration, Intranasal Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*administration & dosage Adult Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage Child Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Humans Regression Analysis Sinusitis/*drug therapy"
22586331,The prognosis of acute and persistent low-back pain: a meta-analysis.,CMAJ,da C Menezes Costa L and Maher CG and Hancock MJ and McAuley JH and Herbert RD and Costa LO,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Although low-back pain is a highly prevalent condition, its clinical course remains uncertain. Our main objective was to systematically review the literature on the clinical course of pain and disability in patients with acute and persistent low-back pain. Our secondary objective was to investigate whether pain and disability have similar courses. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of inception cohort studies. We identified eligible studies by searching MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. We included prospective studies that enrolled an episode-inception cohort of patients with acute or persistent low-back pain and that measured pain, disability or recovery. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodologic quality. We used mixed models to determine pooled estimates of pain and disability over time. RESULTS: Data from 33 discrete cohorts (11 166 participants) were included in the review. The variance-weighted mean pain score (out of a maximum score of 100) was 52 (95% CI 48-57) at baseline, 23 (95% CI 21-25) at 6 weeks, 12 (95% CI 9-15) at 26 weeks and 6 (95% CI 3-10) at 52 weeks after the onset of pain for cohorts with acute pain. Among cohorts with persistent pain, the variance-weighted mean pain score (out of 100) was 51 (95% CI 44-59) at baseline, 33 (95% CI 29-38) at 6 weeks, 26 (95% CI 20-33) at 26 weeks and 23 (95% CI 16-30) at 52 weeks after the onset of pain. The course of disability outcomes was similar to the time course of pain outcomes in the acute pain cohorts, but the pain outcomes were slightly worse than disability outcomes in the persistent pain cohorts. INTERPRETATION: Patients who presented with acute or persistent low-back pain improved markedly in the first six weeks. After that time improvement slowed. Low to moderate levels of pain and disability were still present at one year, especially in the cohorts with persistent pain.",Acute Pain Chronic Pain *Disability Evaluation Disabled Persons Humans Low Back Pain/*complications Prognosis *Quality of Life Regression Analysis

We examined a case series of postmortem brains from U.S. military veterans exposed to blast and/or concussive injury. We found evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a tau protein-linked neurodegenerative disease, that was similar to the CTE neuropathology observed in young amateur American football players and a professional wrestler with histories of concussive injuries. We developed a blast neurotrauma mouse model that recapitulated CTE-linked neuropathology in wild-type C57BL/6 mice 2 weeks after exposure to a single blast. Blast-exposed mice demonstrated phosphorylated tauopathy, myelinated axonopathy, microvasculopathy, chronic neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration in the absence of macroscopic tissue damage or hemorrhage. Blast exposure induced persistent hippocampal-dependent learning and memory deficits that persisted for at least 1 month and correlated with impaired axonal conduction and defective activity-dependent long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission. Intracerebral pressure recordings demonstrated that shock waves traversed the mouse brain with minimal change and without thoracic contributions. Kinematic analysis revealed blast-induced head oscillation at accelerations sufficient to cause brain injury. Head immobilization during blast exposure prevented blast-induced learning and memory deficits. The contribution of blast wind to injurious head acceleration may be a primary injury mechanism leading to blast-related TBI and CTE. These results identify common pathogenic determinants leading to CTE in blast-exposed military veterans and head-injured athletes and additionally provide mechanistic evidence linking blast exposure to persistent impairments in neurophysiological function, learning, and memory.","Acceleration Adolescent Adult Animals Athletes Axons/pathology Behavior, Animal Blast Injuries/*complications/*pathology/physiopathology Brain Concussion/complications/pathology/physiopathology Brain Injury, Chronic/*complications/*pathology/physiopathology Disease Models, Animal Head/pathology/physiopathology Hippocampus/pathology/physiopathology/ultrastructure Humans Intracranial Pressure Long-Term Potentiation Male Mice Middle Aged Military Personnel/*psychology Phosphorylation Postmortem Changes Synaptic Transmission Veterans/*psychology Young Adult tau Proteins/metabolism"

A neural interface system could restore mobility and independence for people with paralysis by translating neuronal activity directly into control signals for assistive devices. We have previously shown that people with long-standing tetraplegia can use a neural interface system to move and click a computer cursor and to control physical devices. Able-bodied monkeys have used a neural interface system to control a robotic arm, but it is unknown whether people with profound upper extremity paralysis or limb loss could use cortical neuronal ensemble signals to direct useful arm actions. Here we demonstrate the ability of two people with long-standing tetraplegia to use neural interface system-based control of a robotic arm to perform three-dimensional reach and grasp movements. Participants controlled the arm and hand over a broad space without explicit training, using signals decoded from a small, local population of motor cortex (MI) neurons recorded from a 96-channel microelectrode array. One of the study participants, implanted with the sensor 5 years earlier, also used a robotic arm to drink coffee from a bottle. Although robotic reach and grasp actions were not as fast or accurate as those of an able-bodied person, our results demonstrate the feasibility for people with tetraplegia, years after injury to the central nervous system, to recreate useful multidimensional control of complex devices directly from a small sample of neural signals.",Aged Arm/*physiology Calibration Drinking/physiology Female Hand/physiology Hand Strength/*physiology Humans Male *Man-Machine Systems Microelectrodes Middle Aged Motor Cortex/cytology/physiology Movement/*physiology Psychomotor Performance Quadriplegia/*physiopathology Robotics/*instrumentation/*methods Time Factors

Results suggest that younger athletes and female athletes may take longer to recover from a concussion. However, little is known about the interactive effects of age and sex on symptoms, neurocognitive testing (NCT), and postural stability. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to examine sex and age differences in symptoms, NCT, and postural stability following concussion. We hypothesized that high school and female athletes would have worse symptoms, NCT, and postural stability than college and male athletes, respectively. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A total of 296 concussed athletes from a multistate, 2-year study were enrolled in this study. Participants completed the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test (ImPACT) and Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) at baseline and again at 2, 7, and 14 days after concussion. Participants completed the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) at 1, 2, and 3 days after concussion. RESULTS: Female athletes performed worse than male athletes on visual memory (mean, 65.1% and 70.1%, respectively; P = .049) and reported more symptoms (mean, 14.4 and 10.1, respectively) after concussion (P = .035). High school athletes performed worse than college athletes on verbal (mean, 78.8% and 82.7%, respectively; P = .001) and visual (mean, 65.8% and 69.4%, respectively; P = .01) memory. High school athletes were still impaired on verbal memory 7 days after concussion compared with collegiate athletes (P = .001). High school male athletes scored worse on the BESS than college male athletes (mean, 18.8 and 13.0, respectively; P = .001). College female athletes scored worse on the BESS than high school female athletes (mean, 21.1 and 16.9, respectively; P = .001). CONCLUSION: The results of the current study supported age differences in memory and sex differences in memory and symptoms and an interaction between age and sex on postural stability after concussion that warrant consideration from clinicians and researchers when interpreting symptoms, specific components of NCT, and postural stability tests.

RESULTS: Compared with infants fed at the breast, infants fed only by bottle gained 71 or 89 g more per month when fed nonhuman milk only (P < .001) or human milk only (P = .02), respectively. Weight gain was negatively associated with proportion of breastmilk feedings, but it was positively associated with proportion of bottle-feedings among those who received mostly breastmilk. Among infants fed only breastmilk, monthly weight gain increased from 729 g when few feedings were by bottle to 780 g when most feedings were by bottle. CONCLUSIONS: Infant weight gain might be associated not only with type of milk consumed but also with mode of milk delivery. Regardless of milk type in the bottle, bottle-feeding might be distinct from feeding at the breast in its effect on infants' weight gain.","Adolescent Adult Bottle Feeding/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data *Breast Feeding/statistics & numerical data Breast Milk Expression/statistics & numerical data Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Infant Infant Formula Infant, Newborn Male Milk, Human Models, Statistical Risk *Weight Gain Young Adult"
22566546,"Differences in nutrient intake associated with state laws regarding fat, sugar, and caloric content of competitive foods.",Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med,Taber DR and Chriqui JF and Chaloupka FJ,uic,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether nutrient intake is healthier among high school students in California, which regulates the nutrition content of competitive foods sold in high schools, than among students in states with no such standards. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: California and 14 states without high school competitive food nutrition standards in the 2009-2010 school year. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 680 high school students sampled in February through May 2010 as part of the National Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Study. INTERVENTIONS: State laws governing fat, sugar, and caloric content of competitive foods sold in vending machines, school stores, and cafeterias (a la carte). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Several measures of nutrient intake assessed by 24-hour recall, overall and stratified by location of consumption (school, home, other). RESULTS: On average, California students reported consuming less fat, sugar, and total calories at school than students in states with no competitive food nutrition standards. California students also reported less at-school intake of vitamins and minerals. All at-school differences in nutrient intake were null after adjusting for total caloric intake; California students consumed a lower proportion of their daily calories in school (21.5%) than students in other states (28.4%). Mean overall intake was lower in California for most measures that were analyzed, particularly added sugars. CONCLUSIONS: California high school students consumed lower quantities of fat, sugar, and calories in school than students in states with no competitive food nutrition standards, but the nutrition composition of California students' in-school diet was similar. Policy initiatives should promote competitive foods that are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.","Adolescent California Cross-Sectional Studies Diet Surveys *Dietary Fats *Dietary Sucrose *Energy Intake Female *Government Regulation Health Promotion/*legislation & jurisprudence Humans *Legislation, Food Linear Models Male Nutritional Status Schools State Government United States"

In a placebo-controlled trial, we examined the efficacy of O3FA in children and adolescents with TD. METHODS: Thirty-three children and adolescents (ages 6-18) with TD were randomly assigned, double-blind, to O3FA or placebo for 20 weeks. O3FA consisted of combined eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Placebo was olive oil. Groups were compared by using (1) intent-to-treat design, with the last-observation-carried-forward controlling for baseline measures and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder via (a) logistic regression, comparing percentage of responders on the primary Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS)-Tic and secondary (YGTSS-Global and YGTSS-Impairment) outcome measures and (b) analysis of covariance; and (2) longitudinal mixed-effects models. RESULTS: At end point, subjects treated with O3FA did not have significantly higher response rates or lower mean scores on the YGTSS-Tic (53% vs 38%; 15.6 +/- 1.6 vs 17.1 +/- 1.6, P > .1). However, significantly more subjects on O3FA were considered responders on the YGTSS-Global measure (53% vs 31%, P = .05) and YGTSS-Impairment measure (59% vs 25%, P < .05), and mean YGTSS-Global scores were significantly lower in the O3FA-treated group than in the placebo group (31.7 +/- 2.9 vs 40.9 +/- 3.0, P = .04). Obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were not significantly affected by O3FA. Longitudinal analysis did not yield group differences on any of the measures. CONCLUSIONS: O3FA did not reduce tic scores, but it may be beneficial in reduction of tic-related impairment for some children and adolescents with TD. Limitations include the small sample and the possible therapeutic effects of olive oil.","Adolescent Child Double-Blind Method Fatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage Female Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Plant Oils/administration & dosage Tics/drug therapy/pathology/psychology Tourette Syndrome/*drug therapy/*pathology/psychology Treatment Outcome"

The objective of this study was to examine the recent trends in the prevalence of selected biological CVD risk factors and the prevalence of these risk factors by overweight/obesity status among US adolescents. METHODS: The NHANES is a cross-sectional, stratified, multistage probability sample survey of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The study sample included 3383 participants aged 12 to 19 years from the 1999 through 2008 NHANES. RESULTS: Among the US adolescents aged 12 to 19 years, the overall prevalence was 14% for prehypertension/hypertension, 22% for borderline-high/high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 6% for low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (<35 mg/dL), and 15% for prediabetes/diabetes during the survey period from 1999 to 2008. No significant change in the prevalence of prehypertension/hypertension (17% and 13%) and borderline-high/high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (23% and 19%) was observed from 1999-2000 to 2007-2008, but the prevalence of prediabetes/diabetes increased from 9% to 23%. A consistent dose-response increase in the prevalence of each of these CVD risk factors was observed by weight categories: the estimated 37%, 49%, and 61% of the overweight, obese, and normal-weight adolescents, respectively, had at least 1 of these CVD risk factors during the 1999 through 2008 study period.

DESIGN: A prospective cohort study with a minimum 2-week continuous assessment period. Data on sleep and awake periods were processed using the sleep, activity, fatigue, and task effectiveness model. SETTING: Rotations at 2 academic tertiary care centers. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven of 33 volunteer orthopedic surgical residents (82%) completed the study, representing 65% (33 of 51) of the orthopedic residency program. INTERVENTION: Residents' sleep and awake periods were continuously recorded via actigraphy, and a daily questionnaire was used to analyze mental fatigue. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of time at less than 80% mental effectiveness (correlating with an increased risk of error), percentage of time at less than 70% mental effectiveness (correlating with a blood alcohol level of 0.08%), the mean amount of daily sleep, and the relative risk of medical error compared with chance. RESULTS: Residents were fatigued during 48% and impaired during 27% of their time awake. Among all residents, the mean amount of daily sleep was 5.3 hours. Overall, residents' fatigue levels were predicted to increase the risk of medical error by 22% compared with well-rested historical control subjects. Night-float residents were more impaired (P = .02), with an increased risk of medical error (P = .045). CONCLUSIONS: Resident fatigue is prevalent, pervasive, and variable.

Emergence of artemisinin resistance or tolerance in Plasmodium falciparum on the Thailand-Cambodia border makes protection of the effectiveness of the drug supply imperative. We reviewed published and unpublished studies reporting chemical analyses and assessments of packaging of antimalarial drugs. Of 1437 samples of drugs in five classes from seven countries in southeast Asia, 497 (35%) failed chemical analysis, 423 (46%) of 919 failed packaging analysis, and 450 (36%) of 1260 were classified as falsified. In 21 surveys of drugs from six classes from 21 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, 796 (35%) of 2297 failed chemical analysis, 28 (36%) of 77 failed packaging analysis, and 79 (20%) of 389 were classified as falsified. Data were insufficient to identify the frequency of substandard (products resulting from poor manufacturing) antimalarial drugs, and packaging analysis data were scarce. Concurrent interventions and a multifaceted approach are needed to define and eliminate criminal production, distribution, and poor manufacturing of antimalarial drugs.

With the current obesity epidemic, maternal adiposity and its associated effects on circulating adipokines and inflammatory proteins may now have a greater impact on fetal growth. We sought to evaluate the independent effects of maternal glycemia, lipids, obesity, adipokines and inflammation on infant birth weight. METHODS: We included 472 women who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test in late pregnancy and were found not to have gestational diabetes; 104 (22.0%) had gestational impaired glucose tolerance. We also measured fasting levels of insulin, low-and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin, adiponectin and C-reactive protein. Obstetric outcomes were assessed at delivery. RESULTS: The mean birth weight was 3481 g (standard deviation 493 g); 68 of the infants were large for gestational age. On multiple linear regression analysis, positive determinants of birth weight were length of gestation, male infant, weight gain during pregnancy up to the time of the oral glucose tolerance test, body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy and impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy. Leptin, adiponectin and C-reactive protein levels were each negatively associated with birth weight. On logistic regression analysis, the significant metabolic predictors of having a large-for-gestational-age infant were BMI before pregnancy (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.27, per 1 kg/m(2) increase), weight gain during pregnancy up to the time of the oral glucose tolerance test (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19, per 1 kg increase) and leptin level (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30-0.82, per 1 standard deviation change).

METHODS: From a cohort analysis of quality improvement data from 66 neonatal follow-up programs in the California Children's Services and California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative High-Risk Infant Follow-Up Quality of Care Initiative, 5129 high-risk infants were evaluated at the first visit between 4 and 8 months of age in neonatal follow-up. A total of 1737 high-risk infants were evaluated at the second visit between 12 and 16 months of age. We calculated referral rates in relation to developmental status (high versus low concern) based on standardized developmental testing or screening. RESULTS: Among infants with low concerns (standard score >70 or passed screen) at the first visit, 6% were referred to early intervention; among infants with high concerns, 28% of infants were referred to early intervention. Even after including referrals to other (private) therapies, 34% infants with high concerns did not receive any referrals. These rates were similar for the second visit. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the specialization of neonatal follow-up programs to identify high-risk infants with developmental delays, a large proportion of potentially eligible infants were not referred to early intervention.","California/epidemiology Cohort Studies Early Medical Intervention/methods/*trends Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Infant, Newborn Male Neonatal Screening/methods/*trends *Population Surveillance/methods Referral and Consultation/*trends Risk Factors"
22614769,Childhood cancer incidence trends in association with US folic acid fortification (1986-2008).,Pediatrics,Linabery AM and Johnson KJ and Ross JA,umn,"OBJECTIVE: Epidemiologic evidence indicates that prenatal vitamin supplementation reduces risk for some childhood cancers; however, a systematic evaluation of population-based childhood cancer incidence trends after fortification of enriched grain products with folic acid in the United States in 1996-1998 has not been previously reported. Here we describe temporal trends in childhood cancer incidence in association with US folic acid fortification. METHODS: Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program data (1986-2008), we calculated incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals to compare pre- and postfortification cancer incidence rates in children aged 0 to 4 years. Incidence trends were also evaluated by using joinpoint and loess regression models. RESULTS: From 1986 through 2008, 8829 children aged 0 to 4 years were diagnosed with malignancies, including 3790 and 3299 in utero during the pre- and postfortification periods, respectively. Pre- and postfortification incidence rates were similar for all cancers combined and for most specific cancer types. Rates of Wilms tumor (WT), primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), and ependymomas were significantly lower postfortification. Joinpoint regression models detected increasing WT incidence from 1986 through 1997 followed by a sizable decline from 1997 through 2008, and increasing PNET incidence from 1986 through 1993 followed by a sharp decrease from 1993 through 2008. Loess curves indicated similar patterns. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for a decrease in WT and possibly PNET incidence, but not other childhood cancers, after US folic acid fortification.","Child, Preschool Female Folic Acid/*administration & dosage *Food, Fortified Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Male Neoplasms/diagnosis/*diet therapy/*epidemiology Nutrition Surveys/*trends Registries United States/epidemiology"

22621821,Derivation and cardiomyocyte differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells from heart failure patients.,Eur Heart J,Zwi-Dantsis L and Huber I and Habib M and Winterstern A and Gepstein A and Arbel G and Gepstein L,Missing,"AIMS: Myocardial cell replacement therapies are hampered by a paucity of sources for human cardiomyocytes and by the expected immune rejection of allogeneic cell grafts. The ability to derive patient-specific human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) may provide a solution to these challenges. We aimed to derive hiPSCs from heart failure (HF) patients, to induce their cardiomyocyte differentiation, to characterize the generated hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and to evaluate their ability to integrate with pre-existing cardiac tissue. METHODS AND RESULTS: Dermal fibroblasts from two HF patients were reprogrammed by retroviral delivery of Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 or by using an excisable polycistronic lentiviral vector. The resulting HF-hiPSCs displayed adequate reprogramming properties and could be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes with the same efficiency as control hiPSCs (derived from human foreskin fibroblasts). Gene expression and immunostaining studies confirmed the cardiomyocyte phenotype of the differentiating HF-hiPSC-CMs. Multi-electrode array recordings revealed the development of a functional cardiac syncytium and adequate chronotropic responses to adrenergic and cholinergic stimulation. Next, functional integration and synchronized electrical activities were demonstrated between hiPSC-CMs and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in co-culture studies. Finally, in vivo transplantation studies in the rat heart revealed the ability of the HF-hiPSC-CMs to engraft, survive, and structurally integrate with host cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Human-induced pluripotent stem cells can be established from patients with advanced heart failure and coaxed to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, which can integrate with host cardiac tissue. This novel source for patient-specific heart cells may bring a unique value to the emerging field of cardiac regenerative medicine.","Animals Cell Differentiation Cell Survival Female Genetic Vectors Heart Failure/*pathology/therapy Humans Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/transplantation Karyotype Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/pharmacology Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology Nuclear Reprogramming/drug effects Octamer Transcription Factor-3/pharmacology Rats Rats, Sprague-Dawley SOXB1 Transcription Factors/pharmacology Transgenes Transplantation, Heterologous"

BACKGROUND: The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and 6 other societies recently published joint appropriateness criteria for coronary revascularization. METHODS: Data from patients who underwent CABG surgery and PCI without acute coronary syndrome or previous CABG surgery in New York in 2009 and 2010 were used to assess appropriateness and to examine the variation across hospitals in inappropriateness ratings. RESULTS: Of the 8,168 patients undergoing CABG surgery in New York without ACS/prior CABG who could be rated, 90.0% were appropriate for revascularization, 1.1% were inappropriate, and 8.6% were uncertain. Of the 33,970 PCI patients eligible for rating, 28% lacked sufficient information to be rated. Of the patients who could be rated, 36.1% were appropriate, 14.3% were inappropriate, and 49.6% were uncertain.

Treatment-related scarring, disfigurement, and persistent hair loss, in addition to their long-term impact on psychological distress or health-related quality of life (HRQOL), have received little attention. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Self-reported scarring/disfigurement and persistent hair loss were examined in 14,358 survivors and 4,023 siblings from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Multivariable models were used to examine associations with demographic and cancer treatment. The impact of disfigurement and hair loss on HRQOL (ie, Medical Outcomes Short Form-36) and emotional distress (ie, Brief Symptom Inventory-18) was examined. RESULTS: Survivors reported a significantly higher rate of scarring/disfigurement compared with siblings for head/neck (25.1% v 8.4%), arms/legs (18.2% v 10.2%), and chest/abdomen (38.1% v 9.1%), as well as hair loss (14.0% v 6.3%). In age-, sex-, and race-adjusted models, cranial radiation exposure >/= 36 Gy increased risk for head/neck disfigurement (relative risk [RR], 2.42; 95% CI, 2.22 to 2.65) and hair loss (RR, 4.24; 95% CI, 3.63 to 4.95). Adjusting for cranial radiation, age, sex, race, education, and marital status, survivor hair loss increased risk of anxiety (RR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.07), whereas head/neck disfigurement increased risk of depression (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.41). Limitations due to emotional symptoms were associated with head/neck disfigurement (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.41), arm/leg disfigurement (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.35), and hair loss (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.47).

The etiology of pachydermodactyly is unknown but is believed to be due to repeated mechanical injury of the skin. We report 2 cases identified in poultry processing workers and review other conditions associated with these cutaneous findings. OBSERVATIONS: The 2 workers in this report were employed as a chicken catcher and a chicken hanger. On examination, both workers had marked lateral thickening of the digits, with associated pain and pruritus. The workers' skin condition developed despite the use of protective gloves, and their symptoms improved when removed from work. However, the swelling due to fibromatosis persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Similar cutaneous findings have been reported in other occupations exposing individuals to repetitive skin trauma, and many patients demonstrating a compulsive habit of hand manipulation. This supports the conclusion that pachydermodactyly in these patients reflects repeated skin trauma. Repetitive mechanical injury in the poultry processing environment can result in considerable compensatory tissue changes.

The efficacy of soy isoflavone supplementation to stimulate nitric oxide production and lower blood pressure in menopausal women with high normal blood pressure remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to test the effect of soy isoflavone supplementation on nitric oxide production and blood pressure in menopausal women with high normal blood pressure. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled 6-wk trial was conducted to assess the effects of daily supplementation with 80 mg soy hypocotyl isoflavones (in aglycone units) on nitric oxide metabolism and blood pressure in 24 menopausal women with 12 women per group. Changes in nitric oxide metabolism were assessed via a primed, constant-infusion protocol with [15N]arginine and [13C]- and [2H]citrulline. Changes in blood pressure and associated vascular hemodynamics were assessed via office and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, forearm blood flow, and indexes of arterial compliance. RESULTS: When compared with placebo and after control for pretreatment values, soy isoflavone supplementation had no effect on arginine flux, citrulline flux, nitric oxide synthesis, blood pressure, forearm blood flow, or estimates of arterial stiffness.

DESIGN: A population-based skin cancer screening intervention (the SCREEN project) in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein (July 1, 2003, to June 30, 2004). SETTING: Physician offices. Participants could choose between nondermatologist physicians and dermatologists for their initial whole-body skin examination. All screening physicians received a mandatory 8-hour training course. PARTICIPANTS Inhabitants of Schleswig-Holstein 20 years or older with statutory health insurance (N = 360,288). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of excisions and yields of malignant skin tumors (malignant melanomas [MMs], basal cell carcinomas [BCCs], and squamous cell carcinomas [SCCs]), stratified by sex and age. RESULTS: Overall, 15,983 excisions were performed (1 of 23 screenees). A total of 3103 malignant skin tumors were diagnosed in 2911 persons: 585 MMs, 1961 BCCs, 392 SCCs, and 165 other malignant skin tumors. Overall, 116 persons (3103 of 360,288) had to be screened to find 1 malignant tumor, with 1 of 620 for MM, 1 of 184 for BCC, and 1 of 920 for SCC. Twenty excisions were performed to find 1 melanoma in men 65 years and older, but more than 50 excisions were required to find 1 melanoma in men aged between 20 and 49 years. CONCLUSIONS: The results of SCREEN suggest a high yield of malignant skin tumors in a large-scale population-based screening project. We found that a high number of excisions was performed in the youngest screenees with an associated low yield, suggesting a need in screener training to emphasize a more conservative attitude toward excisions in young screenees.","Adult Aged Carcinoma, Basal Cell/diagnosis/epidemiology/*surgery Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/diagnosis/epidemiology/*surgery Early Detection of Cancer/statistics & numerical data Female Germany/epidemiology Humans Male Mass Screening/*statistics & numerical data Melanoma/diagnosis/epidemiology/*surgery Middle Aged Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*surgery Young Adult"
22551330,Serenoa repens monotherapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): an updated Cochrane systematic review.,BJU Int,MacDonald R and Tacklind JW and Rutks I and Wilt TJ,Missing,"What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? For the past 30 years Serenoa repens has become a widely used phytotherapy in the USA and in Europe, mostly because of positive comparisons to alpha-blockers and 5alpha-reductase inhibitors. During the last 4 years we have seen two very high quality trials comparing Serenoa repens to placebo and up to 72 weeks' duration. These trials found Serenoa repens no better than placebo, even (in one trial) at escalating doses. OBJECTIVE: * To estimate the effectiveness and harms of Serenoa repens monotherapy in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: * We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and other sources through to January 2012 to identify randomised trials. * Trials were eligible if they randomised men with symptomatic BPH to receive Serenoa repens extract monotherapy for at least 4 weeks in comparison with placebo, and assessed clinical outcomes and urodynamic measurements. * Our primary outcome was improvement in LUTS, based on change in urological symptom-scale scores. RESULTS: * In all, 17 randomised controlled trials (N= 2008) assessing Serenoa repens monotherapy (typically 320 mg/day) vs placebo met inclusion criteria, although only five reported American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUASI) or International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS). Trial lengths ranged from 4 to 72 weeks. The mean age of all enrolees was 64.3 years and most participants were of White race. The mean baseline total score was 14 points, indicating moderately severe symptoms. In all, 16 trials were double blinded and adequate treatment allocation concealment was reported in six trials. * In a meta-analysis of three high quality long-to-moderate term trials (n= 661), Serenoa repens therapy was no better than placebo in reducing LUTS based on the AUASI/IPSS (weighted mean difference [WMD]-0.16 points, 95% confidence interval [CI]-1.45 to 1.14) or maximum urinary flow rate (Q(max) ; WMD 0.40 mL/s, 95% CI -0.30 to 1.09). Based on mostly short-term studies, Q(max) measured at study endpoint were also not significantly different between treatment groups (WMD 1.15 mL/s, 95% CI -0.23 to 2.53) with evidence of substantial heterogeneity (I(2) 58%). * One long-term dose escalation trial (72 weeks) found double and triple doses of Serenoa repens extract did not improve AUASI compared with placebo and the proportions of clinical responders (>/= 3 point decrease in the AUASI) were nearly identical (43% vs 44% for Serenoa repens and placebo, respectively) with a corresponding risk ratio of 0.96 (95% CI 0.76-1.22). * Long-term, Serenoa repens therapy was no better than placebo in improving nocturia in one high-quality study (P= 0.19). Pooled analysis of nine short-term Permixon(R) trials showed a reduction in the frequency of nocturia (WMD -0.79 times/night, 95% CI-1.28 to -0.29), although there was evidence of heterogeneity (I(2) 76%) * Adverse events of Serenoa repens extracts were few and mild, and incidences were not statistically significantly different vs placebo. Study withdrawals occurred in approximately 10% and did not differ between Serenoa repens and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: * Serenoa repens therapy does not improve LUTS or Q(max ) compared with placebo in men with BPH, even at double and triple the usual dose. * Adverse events were generally mild and comparable to placebo.",Humans Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms/*drug therapy/etiology Male Middle Aged Phytotherapy/*methods Plant Extracts/*therapeutic use Prostatic Hyperplasia/*complications Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic *Serenoa Treatment Outcome
22528618,Professional language interpretation and inpatient length of stay and readmission rates.,J Gen Intern Med,Lindholm M and Hargraves JL and Ferguson WJ and Reed G,umassmemorial,"BACKGROUND: The population of persons seeking medical care is linguistically diverse in the United States. Language barriers can adversely affect a patient's ability to explain their symptoms. Among hospitalized patients, these barriers may lead to higher readmission rates and longer hospitalizations. Trained interpreters help overcome communication barriers; however, interpreter usage among patients is suboptimal. OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences among patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) in their length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission rate associated with their receiving professional interpretation at admission or discharge. DESIGN: We analyzed the rates of interpretation at admission and discharge of all LEP patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital over a three-year period. We calculated length of stay in days and as log of LOS. We also examined 30-day readmission. Using multivariable regression models, we explored differences among patients who received interpretation at admission, discharge, or both, controlling for patient characteristics, including age, illness severity, language, and gender. PARTICIPANTS: All LEP patients admitted between May 1, 2004 and April 30, 2007. MAIN MEASURES: Length of hospital stay as related to use of professional interpreters; readmission to the hospital within 30 days. KEY RESULTS: Of the 3071 patients included in the study, 39 % received language interpretation on both admission and discharge date. Patients who did not receive professional interpretation at admission or both admission/discharge had an increase in their LOS of between 0.75 and 1.47 days, compared to patients who had an interpreter on both day of admission and discharge (P<0.02). Patients receiving interpretation at admission and/or discharge were less likely than patients receiving no interpretation to be readmitted with 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: The length of a hospital stay for LEP patients was significantly longer when professional interpreters were not used at admission or both admission/discharge.",Adolescent Adult Aged *Communication Barriers Female Health Personnel/*trends Humans Length of Stay/*trends Male Middle Aged *Multilingualism Patient Readmission/*trends *Professional-Patient Relations Retrospective Studies Young Adult
22585695,Sex differences in fertility-related information received by young adult cancer survivors.,J Clin Oncol,Armuand GM and Rodriguez-Wallberg KA and Wettergren L and Ahlgren J and Enblad G and Hoglund M and Lampic C,Missing,"PURPOSE: The aim was to investigate male and female cancer survivors' perception of fertility-related information and use of fertility preservation (FP) in connection with cancer treatment during reproductive age. METHODS: The study sample consisted of cancer survivors diagnosed from 2003 to 2007 identified in population-based registers in Sweden. Inclusion criteria included survivors who were age 18 to 45 years at diagnosis and had lymphoma, acute leukemia, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, or female breast cancer treated with chemotherapy. Of 810 eligible participants, 484 survivors (60% response rate) completed a postal questionnaire. RESULTS: The majority of male participants reported having received information about treatment impact on fertility (80%) and FP (68%), and more than half of the men banked frozen sperm (54%). Among women, less than half (48%) reported that they received information about treatment impact on fertility, and 14% reported that they received information about FP. Only seven women (2%) underwent FP. Predictors for receiving information about treatment impact on fertility were a pretreatment desire to have children (odds ratio [OR], 3.5), male sex (OR, 3.2), and being </= 35 years of age at diagnosis (OR, 2.0). Predictors for receiving information about FP included male sex (OR, 14.4), age </= 35 at diagnosis (OR, 5.1), and having no children at diagnosis (OR, 2.5). CONCLUSION: Our results show marked sex differences regarding the receipt of fertility-related information and use of FP. There is an urgent need to develop fertility-related information adapted to female patients with cancer to improve their opportunities to participate in informed decisions regarding their treatment and future reproductive ability.","Adult Female Fertility Preservation/*methods Humans Infertility, Female/*prevention & control Infertility, Male/*prevention & control Male Middle Aged Neoplasms/*complications/*therapy Patient Education as Topic/*methods Physician-Patient Relations Questionnaires Regression Analysis Sex Factors Social Class Survivors Young Adult"
22785642,Routine same-day discharge after acute or interval appendectomy in children: a prospective study.,Arch Surg,Alkhoury F and Malvezzi L and Knight CG and Diana J and Pasaron R and Mora J and Aserlind A and Stylianos S and Burnweit C,Missing,"HYPOTHESIS: The outcomes of and parental satisfaction with same-day discharge in children undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy warrant making it the usual and customary pathway. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital. PATIENTS: Between July 1, 2010, and March 30, 2011, a total of 207 children were considered for same-day discharge after acute or interval laparoscopic appendectomy. The all-in-one single-incision single-instrument technique was used in 95.7% of children. INTERVENTIONS: Same-day discharge vs overnight admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Operative details, postoperative length of stay, adverse events, and parental satisfaction. RESULTS: Of 207 consecutive children undergoing acute (n = 186) or interval (n = 21) appendectomy, 162 (78.3%) were discharged on the day of surgery. The remaining 45 children were admitted overnight because the hour was too late for discharge in 35 (77.8%), medical indications dictated admission in 5 (11.1%), and social reasons required admission in 5 (11.1%). In all the children, oral medication alone was used for postoperative pain. The complication rates were similar in the same-day discharge group (8.0%) and in the admitted group (6.6%), as were the rates of urgent postoperative visits (7.4% vs 4.4%%) and the readmission rates (2.5% vs 2.2%) (P > .05 for all). The same-day discharge group had a reduced postoperative length of stay compared with the admitted group (mean, 5 vs 16 hours, P < .05). At the time of discharge, most parents (87.0%) stated they were happy with the expeditious discharge, whereas 8.0% indicated they felt nervous but were ultimately satisfied. In retrospect, 8 of 162 parents (4.9%) were not sure early discharge was best, but only 1 parent would insist on admission if faced with the situation again. CONCLUSION: Routine same-day discharge after pediatric appendectomy seems safe, with good parental satisfaction.","Adolescent *Ambulatory Surgical Procedures Appendectomy/*methods Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Female Humans Male Patient Discharge Prospective Studies Young Adult"
22786830,Menopausal hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions: a systematic review to update the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations.,Ann Intern Med,Nelson HD and Walker M and Zakher B and Mitchell J,ohsu,"BACKGROUND: Menopausal hormone therapy to prevent chronic conditions is currently not recommended because of its adverse effects. PURPOSE: To update evidence about the effectiveness of hormone therapy in reducing risk for chronic conditions and adverse effects, and to examine whether outcomes vary among women in different subgroups. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (January 2002 to November 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through the 3rd quarter of 2011), Scopus, and reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of menopausal hormone therapy published in English since 2002 that assessed primary prevention of chronic conditions. DATA EXTRACTION: Investigators extracted data on participants, study design, analysis, follow-up, and results; 2 investigators independently rated study quality by using established criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: 9 fair-quality trials met the inclusion criteria. The Women's Health Initiative reported most of the results, had 11 years of follow-up, and had data most applicable to postmenopausal women in the United States. It showed that estrogen plus progestin therapy reduced fractures (46 fewer per 10 000 woman-years) and increased invasive breast cancer (8 more per 10 000 woman-years), stroke (9 more per 10 000 woman-years), deep venous thrombosis (12 more per 10 000 woman-years), pulmonary embolism (9 more per 10 000 woman-years), lung cancer death (5 more per 10 000 woman-years), gallbladder disease (20 more per 10 000 woman-years), dementia (22 more per 10 000 woman-years), and urinary incontinence (872 more per 10 000 woman-years). Estrogen-only therapy reduced fractures (56 fewer per 10 000 woman-years), invasive breast cancer (8 fewer per 10 000 woman-years), and death (2 fewer per 10 000 woman-years) and increased stroke (11 more per 10 000 woman-years), deep venous thrombosis (7 more per 10 000 woman-years), gallbladder disease (33 more per 10 000 woman-years), and urinary incontinence (1271 more per 10 000 woman-years). Outcomes did not consistently differ by age or comorbid conditions. LIMITATION: Limitations of the trials included low adherence, high attrition, inadequate power to detect risks for some outcomes, and evaluation of few regimens. CONCLUSION: Estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone decreased risk for fractures but increased risk for stroke, thromboembolic events, gallbladder disease, and urinary incontinence. Estrogen plus progestin increased risk for breast cancer and probable dementia, whereas estrogen alone decreased risk for breast cancer.

22641246,Monitoring performance for blood pressure management among patients with diabetes mellitus: too much of a good thing?,Arch Intern Med,Kerr EA and Lucatorto MA and Holleman R and Hogan MM and Klamerus ML and Hofer TP,umich,"BACKGROUND: Performance measures that reward achieving blood pressure (BP) thresholds may contribute to overtreatment. We developed a tightly linked clinical action measure designed to encourage appropriate medical management and a marker of potential overtreatment, designed to monitor overly aggressive treatment of hypertension in the face of low diastolic BP. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in 879 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers and smaller community-based outpatient clinics. The clinical action measure for hypertension was met if the patient had a passing index BP at the visit or had an appropriate action. We examined the rate of passing the action measure and of potential overtreatment in the Veterans Health Administration during 2009-2010. RESULTS: There were 977,282 established VA patients, 18 years and older, with diabetes mellitus (DM). A total of 713,790 patients were eligible for the action measure; 94% passed the measure (82% because they had a BP <140/90 mm Hg at the visit and an additional 12% with a BP >/=140/90 mm Hg and appropriate clinical actions). Facility pass rates varied from 77% to 99% (P < .001). Among all patients with DM, 197,291 (20%) had a BP lower than 130/65 mm Hg; of these, 80 903 (8% of all patients with DM) had potential overtreatment. Facility rates of potential overtreatment varied from 3% to 20% (P < .001). Facilities with higher rates of meeting the current threshold measure (<140/90 mm Hg) had higher rates of potential overtreatment (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: While 94% of diabetic veterans met the action measure, rates of potential overtreatment are currently approaching the rate of undertreatment, and high rates of achieving current threshold measures are directly associated with overtreatment. Implementing a clinical action measure for hypertension management, as the Veterans Health Administration is planning to do, may result in more appropriate care and less overtreatment.","Adolescent Adult Aged Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use Blood Pressure Cohort Studies Diabetes Mellitus/*epidemiology Female Hospitals, Veterans Humans Hypertension/*drug therapy/*epidemiology Male Middle Aged Physician Incentive Plans *Quality Indicators, Health Care Reimbursement, Incentive Retrospective Studies United States Young Adult"
22585886,Typical electronic health record use in primary care practices and the quality of diabetes care.,Ann Fam Med,Crosson JC and Ohman-Strickland PA and Cohen DJ and Clark EC and Crabtree BF,umdnj,"PURPOSE: Recent efforts to encourage meaningful use of electronic health records (EHRs) assume that widespread adoption will improve the quality of ambulatory care, especially for complex clinical conditions such as diabetes. Cross-sectional studies of typical uses of commercially available ambulatory EHRs provide conflicting evidence for an association between EHR use and improved care, and effects of longer-term EHR use in community-based primary care settings on the quality of care are not well understood. METHODS: We analyzed data from 16 EHR-using and 26 non-EHR-using practices in 2 northeastern states participating in a group-randomized quality improvement trial. Measures of care were assessed for 798 patients with diabetes. We used hierarchical linear models to examine the relationship between EHR use and adherence to evidence-based diabetes care guidelines, and hierarchical logistic models to compare rates of improvement over 3 years. RESULTS: EHR use was not associated with better adherence to care guidelines or a more rapid improvement in adherence. In fact, patients in practices that did not use an EHR were more likely than those in practices that used an EHR to meet all of 3 intermediate outcomes targets for hemoglobin A(1c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood pressure at the 2-year follow-up (odds ratio = 1.67; 95% CI, 1.12-2.51). Although the quality of care improved across all practices, rates of improvement did not differ between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent use of an EHR over 3 years does not ensure successful use for improving the quality of diabetes care. Ongoing efforts to encourage adoption and meaningful use of EHRs in primary care should focus on ensuring that use succeeds in improving care. These efforts will need to include provision of assistance to longer-term EHR users.",Diabetes Mellitus/*therapy Diffusion of Innovation Electronic Health Records/*utilization Female Follow-Up Studies Guideline Adherence/*statistics & numerical data Humans Middle Aged Patient Care Management/*methods Practice Guidelines as Topic Primary Health Care/*organization & administration *Quality of Health Care

Several randomized controlled clinical trials have examined the effect of LCPUFA supplementation of infant formula on cognitive development. We conducted this meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of LCPUFA supplementation of infant formula on early cognitive development. METHODS: Two authors searched PubMed, PsychInfo, and Scopus for randomized controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of LCPUFA supplementation of infant formulas on cognition. Our analysis was restricted to randomized controlled clinical trials that examined the effect of LCPUFA supplementation on infant cognition using Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Our primary outcome was the weighted mean difference in Bayley Scales of Infant Development score between infants fed formula supplemented with LCPUFA compared with unsupplemented formula. We conducted secondary subgroup analyses and meta-regression to examine the effects of study sample, LCPUFA dose, and trial methodologic quality on measured efficacy of supplementation. RESULTS: Twelve trials involving 1802 infants met our inclusion criteria. Our meta-analysis demonstrated no significant effect of LCPUFA supplementation of formula on infant cognition. There was no significant heterogeneity or publication bias between trials. Secondary analysis failed to show any significant effect of LCPUFA dosing or prematurity status on supplementation efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: LCPUFA supplementation of infant formulas failed to show any significant effect on improving early infant cognition. Further research is needed to determine if LCPUFA supplementation of infant formula has benefits for later cognitive development or other measures of neurodevelopment.","Cognition/*drug effects/physiology *Dietary Supplements Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*administration & dosage Humans Infant Infant Behavior/drug effects/physiology/psychology Infant Formula/*administration & dosage Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods"

STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated a cohort of 228,876 singleton pregnancies that were covered by Tennessee Medicaid, 1995-2007. RESULTS: Of 23,280 pregnant women with antidepressant prescriptions before pregnancy, 75% of them filled none in the second or third trimesters of pregnancy, and 10.7% of them used antidepressants throughout pregnancy. Filling 1, 2, and >/=3 antidepressant prescriptions during the second trimester was associated with shortened gestational age by 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.3), 3.7 (95% CI, 2.8-4.6), and 4.9 (95% CI, 3.9-5.8) days, when controlled for measured confounders.

METHODS: We undertook a randomized controlled trial involving 330 low-active older adults (aged =65 years) recruited through their primary care physicians' patient databases. Participants were randomized to either the pedometer step-based Green Prescription group (n = 165) or the standard Green Prescription group (n = 165). Both groups had a visit with the primary care practitioner and 3 telephone counseling sessions over 12 weeks aimed at increasing physical activity. Outcomes were the changes in physical activity (assessed with the Auckland Heart Study Physical Activity Questionnaire), blood pressure, BMI, quality of life (assessed with the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey), physical function status (assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery), and falls over a 12-month period. RESULTS: Of the patients invited to participate, 57% responded. At 12 months, leisure walking increased by 49.6 min/wk for the pedometer Green Prescription compared with 28.1 min/wk for the standard Green Prescription (P=.03). For both groups, there were significant increases across all physical activity domains at 3 months (end of intervention) that were largely maintained after 12 months of follow-up. BMI did not change in either group. Significant improvements in blood pressure were observed for both groups without any differences between them. CONCLUSIONS: Pedometer use resulted in a greater increase in leisure walking without any impact on overall activity level.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effect of limiting the variety of different non-nutrient-dense, energy-dense foods (NND-EDFs) (i.e., chips, ice cream, cookies) on dietary intake and weight loss during an 18-mo lifestyle intervention. DESIGN: Two hundred two adults aged 51.3 +/- 9.5 y with a BMI (in kg/m2) of 34.9 +/- 4.3 (57.8% women, 92.2% white) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 interventions: Lifestyle (1200-1500 kcal/d, </=30% of energy as fat; n = 101) or Lifestyle + limited variety (LV) (limit variety of NND-EDFs, i.e., 2 choices; n = 101). Both interventions involved 48 group sessions. Dietary intake, NND-EDF hedonics, NND-EDF variety in the home, and weight were assessed at 0, 6, 12, and 18 mo. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses showed that the Lifestyle+LV group consumed less variety (P < 0.01) and energy daily (P < 0.05) from NND-EDFs than did the Lifestyle group at 6, 12, and 18 mo. The Lifestyle+LV group consumed less total energy daily (P < 0.05) at 6 mo than did the Lifestyle group. The Lifestyle+LV group reported less (P < 0.05) NND-EDF variety in the home at 6 and 18 mo than did the Lifestyle group. The hedonics of one chosen NND-EDF decreased more (P < 0.05) in the Lifestyle+LV group. Despite these effects, no difference in percentage weight loss occurred at 18 mo (Lifestyle+LV: -9.9 +/- 7.6%; Lifestyle: -9.6 +/- 9.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Limitations in dietary variety decreased intakes in the targeted area but did not affect weight loss. Limiting variety in more areas may be needed to improve weight loss and weight-loss maintenance.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the relation of plain-water intake and the substitution of plain water for SSBs and fruit juices with incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) in US women. DESIGN: We prospectively followed 82,902 women in the Nurses' Health Study II who were free of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer at baseline. Diet, including various beverages, was assessed by using validated food-frequency questionnaires and updated every 4 y. Incident T2D was confirmed by using a validated supplementary questionnaire. We used a 4-y lagged analysis to minimize reverse causation (ie, increased water consumption that was due to early stage of diabetes). RESULTS: During 1,115,427 person-years of follow-up, we documented 2718 incident T2D cases. Plain-water intake was not associated with T2D risk in the multivariable-adjusted model that included age, BMI, diet, and lifestyle factors; RRs (95% CIs) across categories (<1, 1, 2-3, 4-5, and >/=6 cups/d) were 1.00, 0.93 (0.82, 1.05), 0.93 (0.83, 1.05), 1.09 (0.96, 1.24), and 1.06 (0.91, 1.23), respectively (P-trend = 0.15). We estimated that the replacement of 1 serving SSBs and fruit juices/d by 1 cup plain water/d was associated with 7% (3%, 11%) and 8% (2%, 13%) lower risk of T2D, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Plain-water intake, per se, was not significantly associated with risk of T2D. However, substitution of plain water for SSBs or fruit juices was estimated to be associated with modestly lower risk of T2D.","Adult Beverages Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology/*prevention & control *Diet Diet Surveys *Drinking *Energy Intake Female Follow-Up Studies *Food Habits *Fruit Humans Incidence Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk *Water"

Here, we introduce an electrochemical neuroprosthesis and a robotic postural interface designed to encourage supraspinally mediated movements in rats with paralyzing lesions. Despite the interruption of direct supraspinal pathways, the cortex regained the capacity to transform contextual information into task-specific commands to execute refined locomotion. This recovery relied on the extensive remodeling of cortical projections, including the formation of brainstem and intraspinal relays that restored qualitative control over electrochemically enabled lumbosacral circuitries. Automated treadmill-restricted training, which did not engage cortical neurons, failed to promote translesional plasticity and recovery. By encouraging active participation under functional states, our training paradigm triggered a cortex-dependent recovery that may improve function after similar injuries in humans.","Animals Axons/physiology Brain Stem/physiology Dopamine Agonists/administration & dosage Electric Stimulation Female Gait Hindlimb/*physiology *Locomotion Motor Cortex/*physiology Nerve Fibers/physiology Neuronal Plasticity Neurons/physiology Paralysis/physiopathology/*rehabilitation Pyramidal Tracts/cytology/*physiology Rats Rats, Inbred Lew Recovery of Function *Robotics Serotonin Receptor Agonists/administration & dosage Spinal Cord/cytology/physiology Spinal Cord Injuries/physiopathology/*rehabilitation"
22575588,Global burden of cancers attributable to infections in 2008: a review and synthetic analysis.,Lancet Oncol,de Martel C and Ferlay J and Franceschi S and Vignat J and Bray F and Forman D and Plummer M,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Infections with certain viruses, bacteria, and parasites have been identified as strong risk factors for specific cancers. An update of their respective contribution to the global burden of cancer is warranted. METHODS: We considered infectious agents classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. We calculated their population attributable fraction worldwide and in eight geographical regions, using statistics on estimated cancer incidence in 2008. When associations were very strong, calculations were based on the prevalence of infection in cancer cases rather than in the general population. Estimates of infection prevalence and relative risk were extracted from published data. FINDINGS: Of the 12.7 million new cancer cases that occurred in 2008, the population attributable fraction (PAF) for infectious agents was 16.1%, meaning that around 2 million new cancer cases were attributable to infections. This fraction was higher in less developed countries (22.9%) than in more developed countries (7.4%), and varied from 3.3% in Australia and New Zealand to 32.7% in sub-Saharan Africa. Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B and C viruses, and human papillomaviruses were responsible for 1.9 million cases, mainly gastric, liver, and cervix uteri cancers. In women, cervix uteri cancer accounted for about half of the infection-related burden of cancer; in men, liver and gastric cancers accounted for more than 80%. Around 30% of infection-attributable cases occur in people younger than 50 years. INTERPRETATION: Around 2 million cancer cases each year are caused by infectious agents. Application of existing public health methods for infection prevention, such as vaccination, safer injection practice, or antimicrobial treatments, could have a substantial effect on the future burden of cancer worldwide.

DESIGN: Best case scenario analysis using a Markov model. SETTING: Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle study. PARTICIPANTS: 2013 people with hypertension who met the criteria for metabolic syndrome, with no history of cardiovascular disease and not receiving antihypertensive therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment effects associated with dark chocolate consumption derived from published meta-analyses were used to determine the absolute number of cardiovascular events with and without treatment. Costs associated with cardiovascular events and treatments were applied to determine the potential amount of funding required for dark chocolate therapy to be considered cost effective. RESULTS: Daily consumption of dark chocolate (polyphenol content equivalent to 100 g of dark chocolate) can reduce cardiovascular events by 85 (95% confidence interval 60 to 105) per 10,000 population treated over 10 years. $A40 ( pound25; euro31; $42) could be cost effectively spent per person per year on prevention strategies using dark chocolate.

22653981,The use of pioglitazone and the risk of bladder cancer in people with type 2 diabetes: nested case-control study.,BMJ,Azoulay L and Yin H and Filion KB and Assayag J and Majdan A and Pollak MN and Suissa S,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if the use of pioglitazone is associated with an increased risk of incident bladder cancer in people with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using a nested case-control analysis. SETTING: Over 600 general practices in the United Kingdom contributing to the general practice research database. PARTICIPANTS: The cohort consisted of people with type 2 diabetes who were newly treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 2009. All incident cases of bladder cancer occurring during follow-up were identified and matched to up to 20 controls on year of birth, year of cohort entry, sex, and duration of follow-up. Exposure was defined as ever use of pioglitazone, along with measures of duration and cumulative dosage. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk of incident bladder cancer associated with use of pioglitazone. RESULTS: The cohort included 115,727 new users of oral hypoglycaemic agents, with 470 patients diagnosed as having bladder cancer during follow-up (rate 89.4 per 100,000 person years). The 376 cases of bladder cancer that were diagnosed beyond one year of follow-up were matched to 6699 controls. Overall, ever use of pioglitazone was associated with an increased rate of bladder cancer (rate ratio 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 3.05). The rate increased as a function of duration of use, with the highest rate observed in patients exposed for more than 24 months (1.99, 1.14 to 3.45) and in those with a cumulative dosage greater than 28,000 mg (2.54, 1.05 to 6.14). CONCLUSION: The use of pioglitazone is associated with an increased risk of incident bladder cancer among people with type 2 diabetes.","Administration, Oral Adult Aged Case-Control Studies Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Female Humans Hypoglycemic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Male Middle Aged Retrospective Studies Thiazolidinediones/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*chemically induced"
22641754,"Developmental status of 1-year-old infants fed breast milk, cow's milk formula, or soy formula.",Pediatrics,Andres A and Cleves MA and Bellando JB and Pivik RT and Casey PH and Badger TM,uams,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although soy formula has been reported to support normal development, concerns exist regarding potential adverse developmental effects of phytochemicals associated with soy protein. This study characterized developmental status (mental, motor, and language) of breastfed (BF), milk-based formula-fed (MF), or soy protein-based formula-fed (SF) infants during the first year of life. METHODS: Healthy infants (N = 391) were assessed longitudinally at ages 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Development was evaluated by using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and the Preschool Language Scale-3. Mixed effects models were used while adjusting for socioeconomic status, mother's age and IQ, gestational age, gender, birth weight, head circumference, race, age, and diet history. RESULTS: No differences were found between formula-fed infants (MF versus SF). BF infants scored slightly higher than formula-fed infants on the Mental Developmental Index (MDI) score at ages 6 and 12 months (P < .05). Infants who were breastfed also had higher Psychomotor Development Index scores than SF infants at age 6 months and slightly higher Preschool Language Scale-3 scores than MF infants at ages 3 and 6 months (P < .05). In addition, BF infants had a lower probability to score within the lower MDI quartile compared with MF infants and a higher likelihood to score within the upper quartile for the MDI and Psychomotor Development Index compared with SF infants. CONCLUSIONS: This unique study showed that all scores on developmental testing were within established normal ranges and that MF and SF groups did not differ significantly. Furthermore, this study demonstrated a slight advantage of BF infants on cognitive development compared with formula-fed infants.","Animals Bottle Feeding/psychology *Breast Feeding/psychology Cattle Child Development/drug effects/*physiology Cohort Studies Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Infant Infant Behavior/drug effects/*physiology/psychology Infant Formula/*administration & dosage Male *Milk Milk, Human/physiology Soybean Proteins/*administration & dosage"
22539069,Association of sweetened beverage intake with incident hypertension.,J Gen Intern Med,Cohen L and Curhan G and Forman J,umaryland,"BACKGROUND: Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is associated with an increased risk of hypertension in cross-sectional studies. However, prospective data are limited. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between SSBs and artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs) with incident hypertension. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression to examine the association between SSBs and ASBs with incident hypertension in three large, prospective cohorts, the Nurses' Health Studies I (n = 88,540 women) and II (n = 97,991 women) and the Health Professionals' Follow-Up Study (n = 37,360 men). MEASUREMENTS: Adjusted hazard ratios for incident clinically diagnosed hypertension. RESULTS: Higher SSB and ASB intake was associated with an increased risk of developing hypertension in all three cohorts. In a pooled analysis, participants who consumed at least one SSB daily had an adjusted HR for incident hypertension of 1.13 (95 % CI, 1.09-1.17) compared with those who did not consume SSBs; for persons who drank at least one ASB daily, the adjusted HR was 1.14 (95 % CI, 1.09-1.18). The association between sweetened beverage intake and hypertension was stronger for carbonated beverages versus non-carbonated beverages, and for cola-containing versus non-cola beverages in the NHS I and NHS II cohorts only. Higher fructose intake from SSBs as a percentage of daily calories was associated with increased hypertension risk in NHS I and NHS II (p-trend = 0.001 in both groups), while higher fructose intake from sources other than SSBs was associated with a decrease in hypertension risk in NHS II participants (p-trend = 0.006). LIMITATIONS: Residual confounding factors may interfere with the interpretation of results. CONCLUSIONS: SSBs and ASBs are independently associated with an increased risk of incident hypertension after controlling for multiple potential confounders. These associations may be mediated by factors common to both SSBs and ASBs (e.g., carbonation or cola), but are unlikely to be due to fructose.",Adult Beverages/adverse effects Carbonated Beverages/*adverse effects Cohort Studies *Drinking Behavior Female Fructose/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Humans Hypertension/*epidemiology/*etiology Incidence Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies Sweetening Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects

METHODS: We describe several changes to the EMR/provider interface and ordering workflow that were implemented as one part of a hospital-wide quality improvement effort to improve patient identification and verification practices. We measured the impact by comparing the number of reported incidents of care being provided to any patient other than for whom it was intended before the intervention, and directly after the intervention. RESULTS: For the year before the interventions described herein, placement of orders in the incorrect patient's chart was the second most common cause of care being provided to the wrong patient, comprising 24% of the reported errors. In the 15 months after the implementation of an order verification screen with the patient's photo centrally placed on the screen, no patient whose picture was in the EMR was reported to have received unintended care based on erroneous order placement in his or her chart. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of patient pictures within a computerized order entry verification process is an effective strategy for reducing the risk that erroneous placement of orders in a patient's EMR will result in unintended care being provided to an incorrect patient.","Child Electronic Health Records/*standards Hospitals, Pediatric/standards Humans Medical Errors/*prevention & control/statistics & numerical data Patient Identification Systems/*methods/standards *Portraits as Topic *Quality Improvement"
22665416,Secular trends in BMI and blood pressure among children and adolescents: the Bogalusa Heart Study.,Pediatrics,Freedman DS and Goodman A and Contreras OA and DasMahapatra P and Srinivasan SR and Berenson GS,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents increased by almost threefold from the 1970s to 2000. We examined whether these secular changes in BMI were accompanied by increases in blood pressure levels. METHODS: A total of 24,092 examinations were conducted among 11,478 children and adolescents (aged 5-17 years) from 1974 to 1993 in the Bogalusa Heart Study (Louisiana). RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity increased from 6% to 17% during this period. In contrast, only small changes were observed in levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and neither mean nor high (based on the 90th percentile from the Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents) levels increased over the 20-year period. Within each race-gender group, mean levels of SBP did not change, whereas mean levels of DBP decreased by 2 mm Hg (P < .001 for trend). Levels of BMI were positively associated with levels of SBP and DBP within each of the 7 examinations, and controlling for BMI (along with other covariates) indicated that only ~60% as many children as expected had high levels of blood pressure in 1993. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that levels of DBP and SBP among children in this large sample did not increase despite the increases that were seen in obesity indicates that changes in blood pressure levels in a population do not necessarily parallel changes in obesity. Additional study of the potential characteristics that have ameliorated the expected increase in high blood pressure could lead to further reductions in risk.","Adolescent *Blood Pressure *Body Mass Index Child Child, Preschool Comorbidity Cross-Sectional Studies Humans Hypertension/*epidemiology Louisiana/epidemiology Obesity/*epidemiology Prevalence Regression Analysis"
22552037,Fish-oil supplementation in pregnancy does not reduce the risk of gestational diabetes or preeclampsia.,Am J Clin Nutr,Zhou SJ and Yelland L and McPhee AJ and Quinlivan J and Gibson RA and Makrides M,Missing,"BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of increasing n-3 long-chain PUFA (LCPUFA) intake during pregnancy in reducing the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and preeclampsia. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine whether n-3 LCPUFA supplementation in pregnancy reduces the incidence of GDM or preeclampsia. A secondary objective was to assess the effect of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on perinatal complications. DESIGN: This was a double-blind, multicenter randomized control trial-the DHA to Optimize Mother Infant Outcome (DOMInO) trial. Pregnant women (n = 2399) of <21 wk gestation were randomly assigned to receive DHA-enriched fish oil (800 mg/d) or vegetable oil capsules without DHA from trial entry to birth. The presence of GDM or preeclampsia was assessed through a blinded audit of medical records. Birth outcomes and prenatal complications were also assessed. RESULTS: The overall incidences of GDM and preeclampsia were 8% and 5%, respectively, based on clinical diagnosis. The RR of GDM was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.27) and of preeclampsia was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.60, 1.25), and they did not differ significantly between the groups. Birth weight, length, and head circumference z scores also did not differ between the groups. There were 12 perinatal deaths and 5 neonatal convulsions in the control group compared with 3 perinatal deaths and no neonatal convulsions in the DHA group (P = 0.03 in both cases). CONCLUSION: DHA supplementation of 800 mg/d in the second half of pregnancy does not reduce the risk of GDM or preeclampsia. Whether supplementation reduces the risk of perinatal death and neonatal convulsions requires further investigation. The DOMInO trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry as TRN12605000569606.","Adult Diabetes, Gestational/*epidemiology/prevention & control Dietary Fats/*administration & dosage *Dietary Supplements Docosahexaenoic Acids/pharmacology/therapeutic use Double-Blind Method Fatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology/therapeutic use Female Fish Oils/*pharmacology/therapeutic use Humans Incidence Infant, Newborn Infant, Newborn, Diseases/epidemiology Maternal Mortality Plant Oils Pre-Eclampsia/*epidemiology/prevention & control Pregnancy Pregnancy Outcome Prevalence Risk Seizures/epidemiology"
22492425,Headache attributed to airplane travel ('airplane headache'): clinical profile based on a large case series.,Cephalalgia,Mainardi F and Lisotto C and Maggioni F and Zanchin G,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The 'headache attributed to airplane travel', also named 'airplane headache' (AH), is a recently described headache disorder that appears exclusively in relation to airplane flights, in particular during the landing phase. Based on the stereotypical nature of the attacks in all reported cases, we proposed provisional diagnostic criteria for AH in a previously published paper. Up to now 37 cases have been described in the literature. METHODS: After our paper was disseminated via the Internet, we received several email messages from subjects around the world who had experienced such a peculiar headache. Their cooperation, by completing a structured questionnaire and allowing the direct observation of three subjects, enabled us to carry out a study on a total of 75 patients suffering from AH. RESULTS: Our survey confirmed the stereotypical nature of the attacks, in particular with regard to the short duration of the pain (lasting less than 30 minutes in up to 95% of the cases), the clear relationship with the landing phase, the unilateral pain, the male preponderance, and the absence of accompanying signs and/or symptoms. It is conceivable to consider barotrauma as one of the main mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of AH. The observation that the pain appears inconstantly in the majority of cases, without any evident disorder affecting the paranasal sinuses, could be consistent with a multimodal pathogenesis underlying this condition, possibly resulting in the interaction between anatomic, environmental and temporary concurrent factors. CONCLUSIONS: This is by far the largest AH case series ever reported in the literature. The diagnostic criteria that we previously proposed proved to be valid when applied to a large number of patients suffering from this condition. We support its recognition as a new form of headache, to be included in the forthcoming update of the International Headache Society Classification, within '10. Headache attributed to disorder of homoeostasis'. Its formal validation would favour further studies aimed at improving the understanding of its pathophysiology and implementing preventative measures.","Adolescent Adult *Aircraft Child Female Headache/*diagnosis/*etiology/therapy Headache Disorders, Primary/complications/diagnosis/therapy Humans Male Middle Aged Pain Measurement/methods Recurrence/prevention & control *Travel Young Adult"

OBJECTIVE: Maternal folic acid intake was examined in relation to the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental delay (DD). DESIGN: Families enrolled in the CHARGE (CHildhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment) Study from 2003 to 2009 were included if their child had a diagnosis of ASD (n = 429), DD (n = 130), or typical development (TD; n = 278) confirmed at the University of California Davis Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders Institute by using standardized clinical assessments. Average daily folic acid was quantified for each mother on the basis of dose, brands, and intake frequency of vitamins, supplements, and breakfast cereals reported through structured telephone interviews. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SEM) folic acid intake was significantly greater for mothers of TD children than for mothers of children with ASD in the first month of pregnancy (P1; 779.0 +/- 36.1 and 655.0 +/- 28.7 mug, respectively; P < 0.01). A mean daily folic acid intake of >/=600 mug (compared with <600 mug) during P1 was associated with reduced ASD risk (adjusted OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.92; P = 0.02), and risk estimates decreased with increased folic acid (P-trend = 0.001). The association between folic acid and reduced ASD risk was strongest for mothers and children with MTHFR 677 C>T variant genotypes. A trend toward an association between lower maternal folic acid intake during the 3 mo before pregnancy and DD was observed, but not after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Periconceptional folic acid may reduce ASD risk in those with inefficient folate metabolism. The replication of these findings and investigations of mechanisms involved are warranted.","California/epidemiology Case-Control Studies Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics Child, Preschool Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) Developmental Disabilities/epidemiology/etiology/genetics Diet/*adverse effects Dietary Supplements/analysis Female Folic Acid/*administration & dosage Folic Acid Deficiency/*physiopathology Food, Fortified/analysis Genetic Association Studies Humans Infant Male *Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/genetics/metabolism Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications/*physiopathology Pregnancy Trimester, First Risk"

We sought to assess racial/ethnic differences in wait-list outcomes among patients listed for HT in the United States in the current era. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared wait-list and posttransplant in-hospital mortality among white, black, and Hispanic patients >/= 18 years of age listed for their primary HT in the United States between July 2006 and September 2010. Of 10 377 patients analyzed, 71% were white, 21% were black, and 8% were Hispanic. Black and Hispanic patients were more likely to be listed with higher urgency (listing status 1A/1B) in comparison with white patients (P<0.001). Overall, 10.5% of white, 11.6% of black, and 13.4% of Hispanic candidates died on the wait-list or became too sick for a transplant within 1 year of listing. After adjusting for baseline risk factors, Hispanic patients were at higher risk of wait-list mortality (hazard ratio 1.51, 95% CI 1.23, 1.85) in comparison with white patients, but not black patients (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.97, 1.31). In comparison with white HT recipients, posttransplant in-hospital mortality was higher in black recipients (odds ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.15, 2.03) but was not different in Hispanic recipients (odds ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.48, 1.29).

22649131,A prospective study of bisphosphonate use and risk of colorectal cancer.,J Clin Oncol,Khalili H and Huang ES and Ogino S and Fuchs CS and Chan AT,Missing,"PURPOSE: Bisphosphonates are used for the treatment of bone metastases and have been associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. A recent case-control study showed an inverse association between bisphosphonate use and colorectal cancer. Data from prospective cohorts are lacking. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively examined the relationship between bisphosphonate use and risk of colorectal cancer among 86,277 women enrolled onto the Nurses Health Study (NHS). Since 1998, participants have returned biennial questionnaires in which they were specifically queried about the regular use of bisphosphonates. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for risk of colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Through 2008, we documented 801 cases of colorectal cancer over 814,406 person-years of follow-up. The age-adjusted HR for women who regularly used bisphosphonates was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.73 to 1.14) and was further attenuated after adjustment for other risk factors (multivariate HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.33). The risk was not influenced by duration of use (P(trend) = 0.79). Compared with nonusers, the multivariate-adjusted HRs of colorectal cancer were 1.24 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.64) for women with 1 to 2 years of use, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.69) for 3 to 4 years of use, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.60 to 1.56) for >/= 5 years of use. There was no association between bisphosphonate use and colorectal cancer within strata of other risk factors.

We aimed to assess the excess risk of leukaemia and brain tumours after CT scans in a cohort of children and young adults. METHODS: In our retrospective cohort study, we included patients without previous cancer diagnoses who were first examined with CT in National Health Service (NHS) centres in England, Wales, or Scotland (Great Britain) between 1985 and 2002, when they were younger than 22 years of age. We obtained data for cancer incidence, mortality, and loss to follow-up from the NHS Central Registry from Jan 1, 1985, to Dec 31, 2008. We estimated absorbed brain and red bone marrow doses per CT scan in mGy and assessed excess incidence of leukaemia and brain tumours cancer with Poisson relative risk models. To avoid inclusion of CT scans related to cancer diagnosis, follow-up for leukaemia began 2 years after the first CT and for brain tumours 5 years after the first CT. FINDINGS: During follow-up, 74 of 178,604 patients were diagnosed with leukaemia and 135 of 176,587 patients were diagnosed with brain tumours. We noted a positive association between radiation dose from CT scans and leukaemia (excess relative risk [ERR] per mGy 0.036, 95% CI 0.005-0.120; p=0.0097) and brain tumours (0.023, 0.010-0.049; p<0.0001). Compared with patients who received a dose of less than 5 mGy, the relative risk of leukaemia for patients who received a cumulative dose of at least 30 mGy (mean dose 51.13 mGy) was 3.18 (95% CI 1.46-6.94) and the relative risk of brain cancer for patients who received a cumulative dose of 50-74 mGy (mean dose 60.42 mGy) was 2.82 (1.33-6.03). INTERPRETATION: Use of CT scans in children to deliver cumulative doses of about 50 mGy might almost triple the risk of leukaemia and doses of about 60 mGy might triple the risk of brain cancer. Because these cancers are relatively rare, the cumulative absolute risks are small: in the 10 years after the first scan for patients younger than 10 years, one excess case of leukaemia and one excess case of brain tumour per 10,000 head CT scans is estimated to occur. Nevertheless, although clinical benefits should outweigh the small absolute risks, radiation doses from CT scans ought to be kept as low as possible and alternative procedures, which do not involve ionising radiation, should be considered if appropriate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Rochester Epidemiology Project was used to identify all patients younger than 18 years who were diagnosed with kidney stones in Olmsted County, Minnesota from 1984 to 2008. Medical records were reviewed to validate first time symptomatic stone formers with identification of age appropriate symptoms plus stone confirmation by imaging or passage. The incidence of symptomatic stones by age, gender and study period was compared. Clinical characteristics of incident stone formers were described. RESULTS: A total of 207 children received a diagnostic code for kidney stones, of whom 84 (41%) were validated as incident stone formers. The incidence rate increased 4% per calendar year (p = 0.01) throughout the 25-year period. This finding was due to a 6% yearly increased incidence in children 12 to 17 years old (p = 0.02 for age x calendar year interaction) with an increase from 13 per 100,000 person-years between 1984 and 1990 to 36 per 100,000 person-years between 2003 and 2008. Computerized tomography identified the stone in 6% of adolescent stone formers (1 of 18) from 1984 to 1996 vs 76% (34 of 45) from 1997 to 2008. The incidence of spontaneous stone passage in adolescents did not increase significantly between these 2 periods (16 vs 18 per 100,000 person-years, p = 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of kidney stones increased dramatically among adolescents in the general population during a 25-year period.

STUDY DESIGN: High school and collegiate athletes (N = 49) underwent post-concussion evaluations between April 2010 and September 2011 and were prescribed at least 1 week of cognitive and physical rest. Participants were assigned to groups on the basis of the time elapsed between sustaining a concussion and the onset of rest (1-7 days, 8-30 days, 31+ days). Main outcome measures included Concussion Symptom Scale ratings and scores on the 4 composite indices of the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing measure, both before and following rest. Mixed-factorial design ANOVA were used to compare changes on the dependent measures within and between groups. RESULTS: Participants showed significantly improved performance on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing and decreased symptom reporting following prescribed cognitive and physical rest (P < .001), regardless of the time between concussion and onset of rest (P = .44). CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that a period of cognitive and physical rest may be a useful means of treating concussion-related symptoms, whether applied soon after a concussion or weeks to months later.","Adolescent Adult Athletes Brain Concussion/diagnosis/*therapy Cognition Disorders/*diagnosis Female Humans Male Models, Statistical Neuroimaging/methods Neuropsychological Tests New Jersey Post-Concussion Syndrome/diagnosis/*therapy Rest Sports Time Factors"
22648719,Do children eat less at meals when allowed to serve themselves?,Am J Clin Nutr,Savage JS and Haisfield L and Fisher JO and Marini M and Birch LL,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The effect of self-serving on young children's energy intake is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine individual differences in the effects of plated and self-served entree portions on children's energy intake. DESIGN: Two within-subjects experiments were used to examine ad libitum intake at meals in 63 children aged 3-5 y when 400 g of a pasta entree was either plated or available for children to self-serve. Child age, sex, BMI, and responsiveness to increasing portion size (defined as individual slope estimates relating ad libitum intake of the entree across a range of entree portions) were evaluated as predictors of self-served portions. RESULTS: Children's entree and meal intakes did not differ between the self-served and plated conditions for the total sample or by child weight status. However, larger self-served entree portions were associated with greater entree and meal intakes. Children who served themselves larger entree portions tended to be overweight and more responsive to portion size (ie, greater increases in entree intake as plated portion size increased). Last, self-served portion predicted both entree and meal intake over and above BMI z score and responsiveness to portion. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypothesis, relative to plated portions, allowing children to self-serve the entree portion did not reduce energy intake. Children who were more responsive to portion-size effects were likely to self-serve and eat larger entree portions. Self-serving is not a one-size-fits-all approach; some children may need guidance and rules to learn how to self-select appropriate portion sizes.","Activities of Daily Living Body Mass Index *Child Behavior Child Day Care Centers Child, Preschool *Diet/adverse effects *Energy Intake *Feeding Behavior Female Food Preferences Humans Male Overweight/etiology Pennsylvania Social Control, Informal"
25218941,"Seasonal variations in reproductive activity of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus: Vitellogenin expression and levels of vitellogenin in the hemolymph during ovarian development.",Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol,Thongda W and Chung JS and Tsutsui N and Zmora N and Katenta A,umces,"In general, season affects the physiology and behavior of most animals. Warmer temperatures accelerate growth and reproduction of ectotherms, whereas these processes are slowed or halted in colder temperatures. Female blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus inhabiting the Chesapeake Bay, exhibit a seasonal migratory behavior that is closely tied with spawning and the release of larvae. To better understand reproductive activities of the migratory adult females, we examined two reproductive parameters of these crabs sampled monthly (April-December, 2006): the levels of vitellogenin (VtG) in the hemolymph and VtG expression in the hepatopancreas and ovary. The full-length cDNA of VtG (CasVtG-ova) has been isolated from the ovary. The putative CasVtG sequence found in the ovary is >99% identical to that of the hepatopancreas and is related most closely to the sequences reported in other crab species. In female C. sapidus, the hepatopancreas produces over 99% of the total VtG toward the ovarian development. Ovarian stages 2 and 3 in the sampled females are characterized by significant high levels of VtG in hemolymph and VtG expression in both the hepatopancreas and ovary. However, during the southbound migration in fall, females at ovarian stages 2 and 3 have decreased VtG levels, compared to those in spring and summer. The decreased vitellogenesis activity during the fall migration suggests seasonal adaptation to ensure successful spawning and the larval release.",Missing

22689871,Birth by cesarean delivery and failure on first otoacoustic emissions hearing test.,Pediatrics,Smolkin T and Mick O and Dabbah M and Blazer S and Grakovsky G and Gabay N and Gordin A and Makhoul IR,health,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal hearing screening occasionally fails. We noticed that infants born by cesarean delivery (CD) appeared to fail the first otoacoustic emissions (OAE) test more frequently than infants delivered vaginally (VD). This might increase maternal anxiety. We aimed to evaluate the influence of mode of delivery on failure to pass the first OAE. METHODS: Overall, 1653 infants of >35 weeks' gestation were evaluated. OAE was performed before discharge. Perinatal-neonatal variables and results of OAE were recorded retrospectively. RESULTS: Compared with VD infants, CD infants had lower gestational age and 1-minute Apgar, more small for gestational age (SGA), and earlier age at first OAE. Univariate analysis: CD, male gender, gestational age 35 to 37 weeks, birth weight </= 2500 g, SGA, and younger age at first OAE were significantly associated with failed first OAE. In infants weighing 2501 to 4000 g, CD infants had 3-fold higher rates of failed first OAE in comparison with VD infants (20.7% vs 7.1%) before 48 hours of age. In the multivariate analysis, variables independently significantly associated with failed first OAE were male gender (odds ratio [OR] 1.42 [1.02-1.98]), CD (emergency CD: OR 3.18 [2.21-4.57], elective CD: OR 3.32 [2.04-5.42]), age 12 to 23 hours at first OAE (OR 3.1 [2.1-4.58]) and SGA (OR 2.2 [1.15-4.28]). CONCLUSIONS: CD infants had significantly higher failure rates on first OAE. We speculate that CD is accompanied by retained fluid in middle ear which may impair neonatal hearing. The timing of first OAE after CD should preferably be postponed beyond 48 hours of age to improve OAE passage and minimize maternal anxiety and costs.","Age Factors *Cesarean Section Female Hearing Loss/*diagnosis Hearing Tests/*methods Humans Infant, Newborn Logistic Models Male Multivariate Analysis Neonatal Screening/*methods *Otoacoustic Emissions, Spontaneous Pregnancy Retrospective Studies Sex Factors Time Factors"
22649138,Increased body mass index is associated with improved survival in United States veterans with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,J Clin Oncol,Carson KR and Bartlett NL and McDonald JR and Luo S and Zeringue A and Liu J and Fu Q and Chang SH and Colditz GA,wustl,"PURPOSE: Obesity increases the risk of death from many malignancies, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common form of NHL, the association between body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis and survival is unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the association between BMI at diagnosis and overall survival in a retrospective cohort of 2,534 United States veterans diagnosed with DLBCL between October 1, 1998 and December 31, 2008. Cox modeling was used to control for patient- and disease-related prognostic variables. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was 68 years (range, 20 to 100 years); 64% of patients were overweight (BMI, 25 to < 30) or obese (BMI, >/= 30). Obese patients were significantly younger, had significantly fewer B symptoms, and trended toward lower-stage disease, compared with other BMI groups. Cox analysis showed reduced mortality in overweight and obese patients (overweight: hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.83; obese: HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.80), compared with normal-weight patients (BMI, 18.5 to < 25). Treatment during the rituximab era reduced the risk of death without affecting the association between BMI and survival. Disease-related weight loss occurred in 29% of patients with weight data 1 year before diagnosis. Cox analysis based on BMI 1 year before diagnosis continued to demonstrate reduced risk of death in overweight and obese patients. CONCLUSION: Being overweight or obese at the time of DLBCL diagnosis is associated with improved overall survival. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for this association will require further study.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over *Body Mass Index Female Humans Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/complications/*mortality Male Middle Aged Obesity/*complications Overweight/complications Prognosis Retrospective Studies United States Veterans/*statistics & numerical data Young Adult"
22648709,Effect of alginate supplementation on weight loss in obese subjects completing a 12-wk energy-restricted diet: a randomized controlled trial.,Am J Clin Nutr,Georg Jensen M and Kristensen M and Astrup A,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Acute studies with alginate-based preloads suggested that these strong gelling fibers may induce increased feelings of satiety and reduce energy intakes. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of alginate supplementation on body weight regulation are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of the study was to investigate the effects in subjects of alginate supplementation in conjunction with energy restriction (-300 kcal/d) on loss of body weight and fat and, second, on metabolic risk markers in comparison with in a placebo group. DESIGN: In a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned 96 obese subjects to either an energy-restricted diet plus a placebo preload supplement or an energy-restricted diet plus an alginate-based preload supplement (15 g fiber). The preload was administered as a beverage 3 times/d before main meals for a period of 12 wk. RESULTS: No differences in loss of body weight and fat between groups were shown in the intension-to-treat (ITT) analysis (P > 0.1). However, in the completer analysis (n = 80), we showed a greater weight loss with alginate (6.78 +/- 3.67 kg) than with the placebo (5.04 +/- 3.40 kg) (P = 0.03), which was mainly attributed to a reduction in the percentage of body fat (P = 0.03). In the ITT analysis, a larger decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was shown in the placebo group than in the alginate group (P < 0.05). Plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, and ghrelin, HOMA-IR, and lipid metabolism did not differ between treatment groups in the ITT analysis (P > 0.1). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that alginate supplementation as an adjunct to energy restriction may improve weight loss in obese subjects who complete a 12-wk dietary intervention.","Adiposity Adult Alginates/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Anti-Obesity Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Beverages/adverse effects/analysis Body Mass Index Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology Denmark/epidemiology Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology *Diet, Reducing Dietary Fiber/adverse effects/*therapeutic use *Dietary Supplements/adverse effects/analysis Double-Blind Method Female Glucuronic Acid/adverse effects/therapeutic use Hexuronic Acids/adverse effects/therapeutic use Humans Insulin Resistance Intention to Treat Analysis Male Middle Aged Obesity/blood/*diet therapy/immunology/metabolism Obesity, Morbid/blood/diet therapy/immunology/metabolism Patient Dropouts Risk Factors *Weight Loss"
22689864,Impact of language proficiency testing on provider use of Spanish for clinical care.,Pediatrics,Lion KC and Thompson DA and Cowden JD and Michel E and Rafton SA and Hamdy RF and Killough EF and Fernandez J and Ebel BE,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of an objective evaluation of provider Spanish-language skills on self-reported language proficiency and comfort using Spanish in a range of clinical scenarios. METHODS: We enrolled pediatric residents with any self-reported Spanish language ability from 3 residency programs. Participants completed a baseline survey, objective language testing, and a posttest survey. We gathered demographics, self-reported Spanish ability, and comfort using Spanish in various clinical scenarios, which were grouped and analyzed by degree of complexity. Between surveys, a language testing service administered a 20-minute, telephone-based assessment of general Spanish proficiency. Scores were reported on a scale from 1 to 12, with scores >/= 9 designated ""proficient."" Participants received a numeric score and brief qualitative feedback on their language ability. RESULTS: Following testing, residents (n = 76) were significantly less likely to report comfort using Spanish in straightforward clinical scenarios, from 64% to 51% (P = .007). That difference was accounted for entirely by residents who tested at a non-proficient level (56% to 39%, P = .006). Testing had no impact on comfort using Spanish in complex or medical-legal scenarios, at any proficiency level. We found no change in self-reported Spanish proficiency in any resident group. CONCLUSIONS: Objective Spanish-language testing decreased nonproficient resident comfort using Spanish in straightforward clinical encounters, but it did not change comfort in complex or legal scenarios. In combination with education and enforceable policies, language testing may play an important role in decreasing nonproficient Spanish use and improving care for patients with limited English proficiency.",Adult *Attitude of Health Personnel *Communication Barriers *Cultural Competency Female Humans Internship and Residency *Language Tests Male *Multilingualism *Pediatrics/education Prospective Studies Quality of Health Care Self Report Translating United States

However, how they evade the antiviral immune response and their selective delivery to, and replication in, tumor over normal tissue has not been investigated in humans. Here, we treated patients with a single cycle of intravenous reovirus before planned surgery to resect colorectal cancer metastases in the liver. Tracking the viral genome in the circulation showed that reovirus could be detected in plasma and blood mononuclear, granulocyte, and platelet cell compartments after infusion. Despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies before viral infusion in all patients, replication-competent reovirus that retained cytotoxicity was recovered from blood cells but not plasma, suggesting that transport by cells could protect virus for potential delivery to tumors. Analysis of surgical specimens demonstrated greater, preferential expression of reovirus protein in malignant cells compared to either tumor stroma or surrounding normal liver tissue. There was evidence of viral factories within tumor, and recovery of replicating virus from tumor (but not normal liver) was achieved in all four patients from whom fresh tissue was available. Hence, reovirus could be protected from neutralizing antibodies after systemic administration by immune cell carriage, which delivered reovirus to tumor. These findings suggest new preclinical and clinical scheduling and treatment combination strategies to enhance in vivo immune evasion and effective intravenous delivery of oncolytic viruses to patients in vivo.","Aged Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology Blood Platelets/virology Colorectal Neoplasms/surgery/therapy Female Genome, Viral/genetics Granulocytes/virology Humans Liver Neoplasms/surgery/therapy Male Middle Aged Oncolytic Virotherapy/methods Oncolytic Viruses/genetics/growth & development/*physiology Virus Replication/genetics/physiology"

Variceal bleeding associated with this disorder causes upper gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. We report the clinical transplantation of a deceased donor iliac vein graft repopulated with recipient autologous stem cells in a patient with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction. METHODS: A 10 year old girl with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction was admitted to the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden, for a bypass procedure between the superior mesenteric vein and the intrahepatic left portal vein (meso Rex bypass). A 9 cm segment of allogeneic donor iliac vein was decellularised and subsequently recellularised with endothelial and smooth muscle cells differentiated from stem cells obtained from the bone marrow of the recipient. This graft was used because the patient's umbilical vein was not suitable and other strategies (eg, liver transplantation) require lifelong immunosuppression. FINDINGS: The graft immediately provided the recipient with a functional blood supply (25-30 cm/s in the portal vein and 40 mL/s in the artery was measured intraoperatively and confirmed with ultrasound). The patient had normal laboratory values for 9 months. However, at 1 year the blood flow was low and, on exploration, the shunt was patent but too narrow due to mechanical obstruction of tissue in the mesocolon. Once the tissue causing the compression was removed the graft dilated. We therefore used a second stem-cell populated vein graft to lengthen the previous graft. After this second operation, the portal pressure was reduced from 20 mm Hg to 13 mm Hg and blood flow was 25-40 cm/s in the portal vein. With restored portal circulation the patient has substantially improved physical and mental function and growth. The patient has no anti-endothelial cell antibodies and is receiving no immunosuppressive drugs. INTERPRETATION: An acellularised deceased donor vein graft recellularised with autologous stem cells can be considered for patients in need of vascular vein shunts without the need for immunosuppression.

22689804,Surveillance computed tomography imaging and detection of relapse in intermediate- and advanced-stage pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,J Clin Oncol,Voss SD and Chen L and Constine LS and Chauvenet A and Fitzgerald TJ and Kaste SC and Slovis T and Schwartz CL,harvard,"PURPOSE Children with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) routinely undergo surveillance computed tomography (CT) imaging for up to 5 years after therapy, resulting in cost and radiation exposure, without clear benefit. The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of surveillance CT, as compared with clinical findings, to detection of disease recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two hundred sixteen patients, age </= 21 years old, were treated on the multicenter Pediatric Oncology Group 9425 trial. Data for patients who experienced relapse were retrospectively reviewed to determine whether imaging or clinical events prompted suspicion of disease recurrence. Correlation was made to disease stage, time to recurrence, relapse site, and overall survival (OS). Results With a median follow-up time of 7.4 years, 25 (11.6%) of 216 patients had experienced a relapse, of whom 23 experienced local relapse. Median time to relapse was 7.6 months (range, 0.2 to 48.9 months). Nineteen relapses (76%) were detected based on symptoms, laboratory or physical examination findings, and two relapses (8%) were detected by imaging within the first year after therapy. Only four patients (16%) had their recurrence detected exclusively by surveillance imaging after the first year. Six deaths occurred, all in patients who experienced relapse within the first year after therapy. No patient with a recurrence after 1 year off treatment has died, regardless of how the recurrence was detected. CONCLUSION The majority of pediatric HL relapses occurred within the first year after therapy or were detected based on change in clinical status. Detecting late relapse, whether by imaging or clinical change, did not affect OS. These findings indicate that CT is overused for routine surveillance of patients with HL.","Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Female Follow-Up Studies Hodgkin Disease/mortality/*pathology/*radiography/therapy Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Multimodal Imaging Neoplasm Staging *Population Surveillance/methods Positron-Emission Tomography Predictive Value of Tests Recurrence Retrospective Studies Salvage Therapy *Tomography, X-Ray Computed Treatment Outcome Young Adult"

METHODS: We prospectively examined the relationship between SHS and major tobacco-related deaths, particularly COPD and stroke, in 910 Chinese (439 men, 471 women) who never smoked from a 17-year follow-up study in Xi'an, China. SHS exposure was defi ned as exposure to another person's tobacco smoke at home or in the workplace. RESULTS: At baseline among the 910 subjects, 44.2% were exposed to SHS at home, 52.9% in the workplace, and 67.1% at home, work, or both. From March 1, 1994, to July 1, 2011, 249 (150 men,99 women) died within 14,016 person-years. Those who were exposed to SHS had increased mortality due to coronary heart disease (adjusted relative risk [RR], 2.15; 95% CI, 1.00-4.61), ischemic stroke (RR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.10-7.55), lung cancer (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.62-6.40), COPD (RR, 2.30;95% CI, 1.06-5.00), and all causes (RR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.29-2.20), with significant dose-response relationships between cumulative SHS exposure at home and work and the increased risk of cause-specific and total mortality (P for linear trend ranged from .045 to , .001). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows dose-response relationships between SHS and major tobacco-related mortality and provides new evidence to support causation for COPD and ischemic stroke.","Cause of Death/trends China/epidemiology Cross-Sectional Studies Female Follow-Up Studies *Forecasting Humans Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/*mortality Risk Factors Smoking/adverse effects/*mortality Survival Rate/trends Time Factors Tobacco Products/*adverse effects Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects"
22696386,Long-acting FSH versus daily FSH for women undergoing assisted reproduction.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Pouwer AW and Farquhar C and Kremer JA,ru,"BACKGROUND: Assisted reproduction techniques (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can help subfertile couples to create a family. It is necessary to induce multiple follicles; this is achieved by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) injections. Current treatment regimens prescribe daily injections of FSH (urinary FSH with or without luteinizing hormone (LH) injections or recombinant FSH (rFSH)).Recombinant DNA technologies have produced a new recombinant molecule which is a long-acting FSH, named corifollitropin alfa (Elonva) or FSH-CTP. A single dose of long-acting FSH is able to keep the circulating FSH level above the threshold necessary to support multi-follicular growth for an entire week. The optimal dose of long-acting FSH is still being determined. A single injection of long-acting FSH can replace seven daily FSH injections during the first week of controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) and can make assisted reproduction more patient friendly. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of long-acting FSH versus daily FSH in terms of pregnancy and safety outcomes in women undergoing IVF or ICSI treatment cycles. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases, trial registers and websites: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, electronic trial registers for ongoing and registered trials, citation indexes, conference abstracts in the ISI Web of Knowledge, LILACS, Clinical Study Results (for clinical trial results of marketed pharmaceuticals), PubMed and OpenSIGLE (10 October 2011). We also carried out handsearches. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing long-acting FSH versus daily FSH in women who were part of a couple with subfertility and undertaking IVF or ICSI treatment cycles with a GnRH antagonist or agonist protocol were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias was independently done by two review authors. Original trial authors were contacted in the case of missing data. We calculated Peto odds ratios for each outcome; our primary outcomes were live birth rate and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) rate. MAIN RESULTS: We included four RCTs with a total of 2335 participants. A comparison of long-acting FSH versus daily FSH did not show evidence of difference in effect on overall live birth rate (Peto OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.10, 4 RCTs, 2335 women) or OHSS (Peto OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.60, 4 RCTs, 2335 women). We compared subgroups by dose of long-acting FSH. There was evidence of reduced live birth rate in women who received lower doses (60 to 120 mug) of long-acting FSH compared to daily FSH (Peto OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.91, 3 RCTs, 645 women). There was no evidence of effect on live births in the medium dose subgroup (Peto OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.27) and no evidence of effect on clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate or ectopic pregnancy rate. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The use of a medium dose of long-acting FSH is a safe treatment option and equally effective compared to daily FSH. Further research is needed to determine if long-acting FSH is safe and effective for use in hyper- or poor responders and in women with all causes of subfertility.","Female Fertilization in Vitro/*methods Follicle Stimulating Hormone/*administration & dosage Hormones/*administration & dosage Humans Live Birth Luteinizing Hormone/*administration & dosage Pregnancy Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic"

OBJECTIVE: In secondary data analyses, we examined effects of supplementation with B vitamins or n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids on depressive symptoms in cardiovascular disease survivors. DESIGN: The SUpplementation with FOLate, vitamins B-6 and B-12 and/or OMega-3 fatty acids (SU.FOL.OM3) trial was a secondary prevention trial (2003-2009; n = 2501) in which individuals aged 45-80 y were randomly assigned, by using a 2 x 2 factorial design, to receive 0.56 mg 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate and vitamins B-6 (3 mg) and B-12 (0.02 mg); EPA and DHA (600 mg) in a 2:1 ratio; B vitamins and n-3 fatty acids; or a placebo. Depressive symptoms were evaluated at years 3 and 5 with the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).

METHODS: We designed a case-control study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data. We identified patients (cases) diagnosed with CRC age 70 to 89 years from January 1998 through December 2002 who died as a result of CRC by 2007. We selected three matched controls without cancer for each case. Controls were assigned a referent date (date of diagnosis of the case). Colonoscopy performed from January 1991 through 6 months before the diagnosis/referent date was our primary exposure. We compared exposure to colonoscopy in cases and controls by using conditional logistic regression controlling for covariates, stratified by site of CRC. We determined endoscopist specialty by linkage to the American Medical Association (AMA) Masterfile. We assessed whether the association between colonoscopy and CRC death varied with endoscopist specialty. RESULTS: We identified 9,458 cases (3,963 proximal [41.9%], 4,685 distal [49.5%], and 810 unknown site [8.6%]) and 27,641 controls. In all, 11.3% of cases and 23.7% of controls underwent colonoscopy more than 6 months before diagnosis. Compared with controls, cases were less likely to have undergone colonoscopy (odds ratio [OR], 0.40; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.43); the association was stronger for distal (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.27) than proximal (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.64) CRC. The strength of the association varied with endoscopist specialty. CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy is associated with a reduced risk of death from CRC, with the association considerably and consistently stronger for distal versus proximal CRC.

22661453,The effect of placebo conditioning on capsaicin-evoked urge to cough.,Chest,Leech J and Mazzone SB and Farrell MJ,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The urge to cough is a clinical symptom of respiratory disease that precedes the motor act of coughing. Although previous studies have shown that cough is particularly susceptible to placebo suppression, it is unclear whether the perception of an urge to cough is also modifiable by placebo. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that capsaicin-evoked urge to cough could be suppressed by placebo conditioning. METHODS: Eleven healthy participants were unknowingly conditioned to believe that an inert inhaler temporarily suppressed capsaicin-induced urge to cough by deceptively modifying the challenge concentration of capsaicin. In subsequent testing, capsaicin-evoked urge-to-cough subjective ratings were assessed in four challenges with a single dose of inhaled capsaicin following no treatment or the placebo metered-dose inhaler. An additional 10 participants were informed that the inhaler therapy was inert prior to receiving capsaicin challenges with and without inhaler treatment. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in mean urge-to-cough ratings to capsaicin challenge following placebo compared with no treatment followed by capsaicin challenge (P < .001), with a peak decrease of 45%. The placebo inhaler alone had no effect on urge-to-cough subjective ratings when participants were aware that it contained no active medication. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that the urge to cough is susceptible to placebo inhibition. This provides further evidence that higher brain networks are involved in the processing of respiratory sensations related to airway irritation.","Administration, Inhalation Adult Capsaicin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects Cough/chemically induced/*drug therapy/physiopathology Disease Progression Female Humans Male Prognosis Reference Values Reflex/*drug effects Respiratory Mechanics/*drug effects Retrospective Studies Sensory System Agents/administration & dosage"

In general, having any insurance versus being uninsured was associated with undergoing cancer screening. For each type of screening, patients who had at least 1 health maintenance visit were significantly more likely to be up-to-date compared with those with no health maintenance visits. A significant interaction was found between having health maintenance visits, having any health insurance, and being up-to-date for cancer screening tests. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the percentage of patients who were up-to-date for any cancer screening, especially cervical cancer screening, was found to be very low in rural Oregon. Patients with some form of health insurance were more likely to have had a health maintenance visit within the previous 2 years and to be up-to-date for breast, cervical, and/or colorectal cancer screening.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/*economics/prevention & control Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*economics/prevention & control Early Detection of Cancer Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Insurance Coverage/*economics Insurance, Health Male *Mass Screening Middle Aged Neoplasm Staging *Primary Health Care Prognosis Retrospective Studies *Rural Population Socioeconomic Factors Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis/*economics/prevention & control"
22710289,Prevalence of alcohol use disorders before and after bariatric surgery.,JAMA,King WC and Chen JY and Mitchell JE and Kalarchian MA and Steffen KJ and Engel SG and Courcoulas AP and Pories WJ and Yanovski SZ,pitt,"CONTEXT: Anecdotal reports suggest bariatric surgery may increase the risk of alcohol use disorder (AUD), but prospective data are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of preoperative and postoperative AUD, and independent predictors of postoperative AUD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort study (Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2) of adults who underwent bariatric surgery at 10 US hospitals. Of 2458 participants, 1945 (78.8% female; 87.0% white; median age, 47 years; median body mass index, 45.8) completed preoperative and postoperative (at 1 year and/or 2 years) assessments between 2006 and 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Past year AUD symptoms determined with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (indication of alcohol-related harm, alcohol dependence symptoms, or score >/=8). RESULTS: The prevalence of AUD symptoms did not significantly differ from 1 year before to 1 year after bariatric surgery (7.6% vs 7.3%; P = .98), but was significantly higher in the second postoperative year (9.6%; P = .01). The following preoperative variables were independently related to an increased odds of AUD after bariatric surgery: male sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.14 [95% CI, 1.51-3.01]; P < .001), younger age (age per 10 years younger with preoperative AUD: AOR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.03-1.68], P = .03; age per 10 years younger without preoperative AUD: AOR, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.65-2.30], P < .001), smoking (AOR, 2.58 [95% CI, 1.19-5.58]; P = .02), regular alcohol consumption (>/= 2 drinks/week: AOR, 6.37 [95% CI, 4.17-9.72]; P < .001), AUD (eg, at age 45, AOR, 11.14 [95% CI, 7.71-16.10]; P < .001), recreational drug use (AOR, 2.38 [95% CI, 1.37-4.14]; P = .01), lower sense of belonging (12-item Interpersonal Support Evaluation List score per 1 point lower: AOR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.15]; P = .01), and undergoing a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure (AOR, 2.07 [95% CI, 1.40-3.08]; P < .001; reference category: laparoscopic adjustable gastric band procedure). CONCLUSION: In this cohort, the prevalence of AUD was greater in the second postoperative year than the year prior to surgery or in the first postoperative year and was associated with male sex and younger age, numerous preoperative variables (smoking, regular alcohol consumption, AUD, recreational drug use, and lower interpersonal support) and undergoing a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure.",Adult Aged Alcohol-Related Disorders/*epidemiology *Bariatric Surgery Cohort Studies Female Humans Male Middle Aged Obesity/*surgery Odds Ratio Postoperative Period Preoperative Period Prevalence Prospective Studies Risk Factors Sex Factors United States/epidemiology Young Adult
22711020,Living alone and cardiovascular risk in outpatients at risk of or with atherothrombosis.,Arch Intern Med,Udell JA and Steg PG and Scirica BM and Smith SC Jr and Ohman EM and Eagle KA and Goto S and Cho JI and Bhatt DL,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Living alone, a proxy for social support, has been inconsistently linked with cardiovascular risk. METHODS: We investigated whether living alone was associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular risk in the global REduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) Registry. Stable outpatients at risk of or with atherothrombosis were recruited from December 1, 2003, through December 31, 2004, and followed up to 4 years for cardiovascular events. Events were examined by living arrangement with risk adjustment for age, sex, clinical risk factors, therapy, preexisting vascular disease, and sociodemographic factors. Effect modification was tested by age, sex, employment, ethnicity, education, and geography. RESULTS: Among the 44 573 REACH participants, 8594 (19%) were living alone. Living alone was associated with higher 4-year mortality (14.1% vs 11.1%) and cardiovascular death (8.6% vs 6.8%; log-rank P < .01 for both comparisons); however, there was significant effect modification by age (P value for interaction = .03). Specifically, among younger participants, living alone compared with those living with others was associated with higher mortality (age 45-65 years: 7.7% vs 5.7%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.24 [95% CI, 1.01-1.51]; age 66-80 years: 13.2% vs 12.3%; adjusted HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.01-1.26]), but this was not observed among older participants (age > 80 years: 24.6% vs 28.4%; adjusted HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.79-1.06]). A similar trend was observed for the risk of cardiovascular death. CONCLUSIONS: In an international outpatient population with atherothrombosis aged 45 years or older, living alone was associated with increased mortality among all but the most elderly patients, although this observation warrants confirmation.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cardiovascular Diseases/*mortality *Family Characteristics Female Humans *Independent Living Internationality Loneliness Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies Risk Factors"
22711727,Maternal exercise and growth in breastfed infants: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,Pediatrics,Daley AJ and Thomas A and Cooper H and Fitzpatrick H and McDonald C and Moore H and Rooney R and Deeks JJ,Missing,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Studies have revealed that women who breastfeed their infants may be reluctant to exercise due to concerns that to do so would adversely affect their breast milk and consequently the growth of their infants. In this review, we seek to systematically review and statistically synthesize evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have assessed the effects of maternal exercise on breastfed infant growth (weight gain and gain in length). METHODS: Searches of the following electronic bibliographic databases were performed to identify RCTs: Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Medline/PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and SPORT Discus. RCTs that compared any type of exercise intervention with other treatments or no treatment in women exclusively or predominately breastfeeding were eligible for inclusion, as were trials involving exercise as a cointervention. Two authors extracted data from studies independently. RESULTS: Four RCTs (5 comparisons) were included in the meta-analysis of infant weight gain that incorporated 170 participants. In breastfed infants, maternal exercise did not significantly affect infant weight gain (difference in mean weight gain = 18.6 g [95% confidence interval: -113.52 to 150.80, P = .73]). Only 1 trial assessed infant gain in length; no difference between the exercise and control groups was reported. Trials were classified as moderate or good methodological quality (moderate risk of bias). CONCLUSIONS: It appears that mothers can exercise and breastfeed without detriment to the growth of their infants, but this is based on limited evidence, and more research is required before this finding is confirmed.","Body Height *Breast Feeding *Child Development *Exercise Female Humans Infant Infant, Newborn *Maternal Behavior Weight Gain Weight Loss"
22711076,Risk for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis: a Danish nationwide cohort study.,Ann Intern Med,Jepsen P and Ott P and Andersen PK and Sorensen HT and Vilstrup H,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis are at higher risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The role of HCC surveillance for these patients is undefined. OBJECTIVE: To provide population-based estimates of HCC incidence and comparisons of HCC-related mortality and total mortality among patients with alcoholic cirrhosis as a basis for assessing the role of HCC surveillance. DESIGN: Nationwide, registry-based, historical cohort study. SETTING: Denmark. PATIENTS: All Danish citizens with a first-time hospital diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis from 1993 to 2005. MEASUREMENTS: Hepatocellular carcinoma incidence and mortality starting 1 year after diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis through 2009; ratio of HCC-related mortality to total mortality. RESULTS: Among 8482 patients, 169 developed HCC. A total of 5734 patients died, 151 of whom had developed HCC. Five-year cumulative HCC risk was 1.0% (95% CI, 0.8% to 1.3%), and 5-year cumulative mortality was 43.7% (CI, 42.6% to 44.7%). Only 1.8% of all deaths were HCC-related. In sensitivity analyses that included all possible HCC diagnoses and a subpopulation of patients who were followed by hepatologists, the highest 5-year HCC risk was 1.9% (CI, 0.8% to 3.9%). These patients did not have higher mortality than patients in the nationwide cohort. LIMITATION: Cirrhosis and HCC diagnoses were made by hospital physicians without uniform clinical criteria, and use of registry data precluded detailed information on clinical care of patients, including HCC surveillance. CONCLUSION: Danish patients with alcoholic cirrhosis have a low risk for HCC, and HCC contributes little to their high mortality. On the basis of these data, HCC surveillance would be expected to have a minimal effect on mortality and is unlikely to be cost-effective.","Aged Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*complications/*epidemiology/mortality Cause of Death Cohort Studies Cost-Benefit Analysis Denmark/epidemiology Female Humans Incidence Liver Cirrhosis, Alcoholic/*complications/*epidemiology/mortality Liver Neoplasms/*complications/*epidemiology/mortality Male Mass Screening/economics Middle Aged Population Surveillance Risk Factors"
22710320,Increased risk of diabetes mellitus and likelihood of receiving diabetes mellitus treatment in patients with psoriasis.,Arch Dermatol,Azfar RS and Seminara NM and Shin DB and Troxel AB and Margolis DJ and Gelfand JM,upenn,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of incident diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients with psoriasis and to evaluate DM treatment patterns among patients with psoriasis and incident DM. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: United Kingdom-based electronic medical records. PATIENTS: We matched 108 132 patients with psoriasis aged 18 to 90 years with 430 716 unexposed patients based on practice and time of visit. For our nested study, only patients who developed incident DM during our study time were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident DM and adjusted risk of pharmacotherapy among those with incident DM. RESULTS: The fully adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) for incident DM were 1.14 (95% CI, 1.10-1.18), 1.11 (95% CI, 1.07-1.15), and 1.46 (95% CI, 1.30-1.65) in the overall, mild, and severe psoriasis groups, respectively. Among those with incident DM and severe psoriasis, the adjusted risk for receiving DM pharmacotherapy was 1.55 (95% CI, 1.15-2.10). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that psoriasis is an independent risk factor for the development of type 2 DM in a dose-dependent manner, and that patients with severe psoriasis who develop DM are more likely to receive systemic diabetic therapies in comparison with patients with DM but without psoriasis.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies Diabetes Complications/*drug therapy Diabetes Mellitus/*drug therapy Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology/*etiology Drug Utilization/statistics & numerical data Female Humans Male Middle Aged Psoriasis/*complications Risk Factors Young Adult"
22711077,Adverse outcomes after hospitalization and delirium in persons with Alzheimer disease.,Ann Intern Med,Fong TG and Jones RN and Marcantonio ER and Tommet D and Gross AL and Habtemariam D and Schmitt E and Yap L and Inouye SK,harvard,"BACKGROUND: Hospitalization, frequently complicated by delirium, can be a life-changing event for patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To determine risks for institutionalization, cognitive decline, or death associated with hospitalization and delirium in patients with AD. DESIGN: Prospective cohort enrolled between 1991 and 2006 into the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (MADRC) patient registry. SETTING: Community-based. PARTICIPANTS: 771 persons aged 65 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of AD. MEASUREMENTS: Hospitalization, delirium, death, and institutionalization were identified through administrative databases. Cognitive decline was defined as a decrease of 4 or more points on the Blessed Information-Memory-Concentration test score. Multivariate analysis was used to calculate adjusted relative risks (RRs). RESULTS: Of 771 participants with AD, 367 (48%) were hospitalized and 194 (25%) developed delirium. Hospitalized patients who did not have delirium had an increased risk for death (adjusted RR, 4.7 [95% CI, 1.9 to 11.6]) and institutionalization (adjusted RR, 6.9 [CI, 4.0 to 11.7]). With delirium, risk for death (adjusted RR, 5.4 [CI, 2.3 to 12.5]) and institutionalization (adjusted RR, 9.3 [CI, 5.5 to 15.7]) increased further. With hospitalization and delirium, the adjusted RR for cognitive decline for patients with AD was 1.6 (CI, 1.2 to 2.3). Among hospitalized patients with AD, 21% of the incidences of cognitive decline, 15% of institutionalization, and 6% of deaths were associated with delirium. LIMITATIONS: Cognitive outcome was missing in 291 patients. Sensitivity analysis was performed to test the effect of missing data, and a composite outcome was used to decrease the effect of missing data. CONCLUSION: Approximately 1 in 8 hospitalized patients with AD who develop delirium will have at least 1 adverse outcome, including death, institutionalization, or cognitive decline, associated with delirium. Delirium prevention may represent an important strategy for reducing adverse outcomes in this population.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Alzheimer Disease/*complications Cognition Disorders/complications Delirium/*complications Female *Hospitalization Humans Institutionalization Male Massachusetts Nursing Homes Prognosis Prospective Studies Risk"

DATA SOURCES: We searched 4 electronic databases (from inception to October 2010) and scanned the reference lists of the publications retrieved to identify eligible comparative epidemiologic studies. STUDY SELECTION: Titles, abstracts, and full text were assessed independently by 2 authors against prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted and quality was assessed independently by 2 authors using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. DATA SYNTHESIS: Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models. Results are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2. Twenty-five studies were included. Smoking was significantly associated with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.15-2.01; I2 = 64%; 6 studies). Smoking was not significantly associated with basal cell carcinoma (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.82-1.09; I2 = 59%; 14 studies) or nonmelanoma skin cancer (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.21-1.79; I2 = 34%; 2 studies). CONCLUSION: This study clearly demonstrates that smoking increases the risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; however, smoking does not appear to modify the risk of basal cell carcinoma.","Carcinoma, Basal Cell/*epidemiology Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*epidemiology Confidence Intervals Humans Odds Ratio Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology Smoking/adverse effects/*epidemiology"

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Large university-affiliated infertility practice. PATIENT(S): Women undergoing ART. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The primary outcome was live birth. Analyses were stratified according to BMI category and adjusted for potential confounders, including maternal and paternal age, baseline serum FSH, duration of gonadotropin stimulation, mean daily gonadotropin dose, peak serum E(2), number of oocytes retrieved, use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection, embryo quality and number, transfer day, and number of embryos transferred. RESULT(S): We analyzed the first autologous fresh IVF or IVF-ICSI cycle of 4,609 patients. There were no differences in the rates of cycle cancellation, spontaneous abortion, biochemical and ectopic pregnancies, or multiple births. After adjusting for potential confounders, patients with BMI >/= 30.0 kg/m(2) had significantly decreased odds of implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth. The adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) of live birth were 0.63 (0.47-0.85) for BMI 30.00-34.99, 0.39 (0.25-0.61) for BMI 35.00-39.99, and 0.32 (0.16-0.64) for BMI >/= 40.0 compared with normal-weight cohorts.

There are four dengue serotypes (DENV1 to DENV4), and infection with one elicits lifelong immunity to that serotype but offers only transient protection against the other serotypes. Identification of the protective determinants of the human antibody response to DENV is a vital requirement for the design and evaluation of future preventative therapies and treatments. Here, we describe the isolation of a neutralizing antibody from a DENV1-infected patient. The human antibody 14c10 (HM14c10) binds specifically to DENV1. HM14c10 neutralizes the virus principally by blocking virus attachment; at higher concentrations, a post-attachment step can also be inhibited. In vivo studies show that the HM14c10 antibody has antiviral activity at picomolar concentrations. A 7 A resolution cryoelectron microscopy map of Fab fragments of HM14c10 in a complex with DENV1 shows targeting of a discontinuous epitope that spans the adjacent surface of envelope protein dimers. As found previously, a human antibody specific for the related West Nile virus binds to a similar quaternary structure, suggesting that this could be an immunodominant epitope. These findings provide a structural and molecular context for durable, serotype-specific immunity to DENV infection.","Animals Antibodies, Neutralizing/pharmacology/*therapeutic use Antiviral Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use Cryoelectron Microscopy Dengue/drug therapy Dengue Virus/*drug effects/immunology/ultrastructure Epitopes/immunology Humans Mice"
22668640,Minimization of hepatitis B infection by a 25-year universal vaccination program.,J Hepatol,Ni YH and Chang MH and Wu JF and Hsu HY and Chen HL and Chen DS,ntu,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was hyperendemic in Taiwan before the implementation of the universal infant hepatitis B immunization program, which was launched in 1984. Five previous seroepidemiologic surveys were conducted at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years after the launch of the vaccination program. METHODS: We enrolled 3332 subjects younger than 30 years of age, with approximately 100 of them in each age cohort. Subjects were recruited voluntarily from schools and other institutions in Taipei, as in previous surveys. HBV seromarkers included hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) and hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). HBV DNA levels were measured in anti-HBc positive/HBsAg negative subjects (anti-HBc only). RESULTS: The HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc seropositive rates were very different between subjects born after the program in 2009 and the baseline group in 1984 (0.9% vs. 10%, 55.9% vs. 24.5%, and 7.0% vs. 28%, respectively). In this 6th survey, we showed that HBsAg prevalence further decreased in the vaccinated cohorts. A positive maternal HBsAg status was found in 86% of vaccine failures. Serum HBV DNA was detected in 4.2% (6/142) of anti-HBc positive/HBsAg negative subjects, with a low level of HBV DNA. All of these six subjects' HBV were genotype C. CONCLUSIONS: The universal infant HBV immunization program in Taiwan has completed its 25-year follow-up and its efficacy in young adults is clear. The continued decrease in HBsAg prevalence suggests that the elimination of HBV infection is becoming a reality.","Adolescent Adult Antibodies, Viral/blood Child Child, Preschool DNA, Viral/blood Female Genotype Hepatitis B/*epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission Hepatitis B Core Antigens/immunology Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/immunology Hepatitis B virus/genetics/immunology Humans Infant Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical Male *Mass Vaccination Prevalence Seroepidemiologic Studies Taiwan/epidemiology Young Adult"

Our review produced 19 pertinent primary articles. Current research demonstrates variable response to treatment, often with conflicting results according to species studied, which contributes to considerable confusion about what treatment is warranted and efficacious. Our review suggests that vinegar causes pain exacerbation or nematocyst discharge in the majority of species. Hot water and topical lidocaine appear more widely beneficial in improving pain symptoms and are preferentially recommended. Unfortunately, they may be difficult to obtain at the site of envenomation, such as the beach or diving sites. In these instances, removing the nematocysts and washing the area with saltwater may be considered. If the envenomation is thought to be due to the bluebottle (Physalia), vinegar may be beneficial.","Animals Bites and Stings/*therapy Cnidarian Venoms/antagonists & inhibitors Hawaii Humans Nematocyst North America Pain Management/methods *Scyphozoa Sea Nettle, East Coast"

DESIGN: We characterized drinking course and plotted drinking status (stable abstainers, abstainers, moderate or risky drinkers) from age 15 to 60 years. SETTING: Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, Albuquerque, New Mexico. PARTICIPANTS: Community sample of previously convicted DWI offenders. MEASUREMENTS: Psychiatric disorders from the Comprehensive International Diagnostic Interview; drinking histories from the Cognitive Lifetime Drinking History. FINDINGS: Risky drinking was prevalent at all ages for both genders. Almost half the population reported either a life-time drinking course of risky drinking (19%) or resumed risky drinking after at least one interval of abstinence or moderate drinking (25%), while about one-fifth followed a never risky or risky to moderate drinking course. Offenders with a life-time diagnosis of substance dependence more often transitioned to risky drinking, and those with life-time alcohol dependence were more prone to transition to abstinence. Across time, those who began risky drinking at age 15 years or later quit at double the rate of those who began before age 15 years. Women's and men's drinking courses were similar, but women began risky drinking at a later age and moved to abstinence more often. CONCLUSIONS: Among people convicted of driving while impaired in the United States, younger age of initiation of drinking and co-occurrence of psychiatric and substance use appear to be associated with a poorer trajectory of subsequent risky drinking behaviour. Women who are convicted of driving while impaired appear to start drinking later in life and be more likely to subsequently become abstainers.",Adolescent Adult Age of Onset Aged Alcohol Drinking/epidemiology/*psychology Alcoholism/epidemiology/psychology/rehabilitation Automobile Driving/*psychology Female Humans Life Style Male Middle Aged New Mexico/epidemiology Personal Satisfaction Risk-Taking Sex Factors Young Adult

DESIGN: Nonblinded before-after trial. SETTING: General dermatology clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients aged 2 to 6 years who underwent cryotherapy for cutaneous viral warts. INTERVENTION: Patients were shown a children's program on a portable video player before cryotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mean score difference on the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale between children treated during the 10 weeks before vs the 10 weeks after the intervention was implemented. RESULTS: Ninety-nine cryotherapy sessions performed among 35 children were evaluated. Fifteen children underwent cryotherapy during the preintervention phase only, and 13 children underwent cryotherapy during the intervention phase only. The mean modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale scores were 58.4 during the preintervention phase and 37.7 during the intervention phase (P = .005). The percentages of children with a high anxiety score (>/=30) were 100% (15 of 15) during the preintervention phase and 38% (5 of 13) during the intervention phase (P < .001). Another 7 children underwent cryotherapy during both the preintervention and intervention phases. Their mean modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale scores were 53.7 during the preintervention phase and 42.0 during the intervention phase (P = .03). The percentages of children with a high anxiety score were 86% (6 of 7) during the intervention phase and 43% (3 of 7) during the intervention phase (P = .25). In both groups, the time spent coaxing and treating children decreased after the intervention, but the differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The use of a portable video player significantly reduced preprocedural anxiety levels in preschool children undergoing cryotherapy for cutaneous viral warts.","Anxiety/*prevention & control Child, Preschool *Cryotherapy Female Humans Male Skin Diseases/*therapy Warts/*therapy"
22700889,Intrinsic risk factors of noncontact ankle sprains in soccer: a prospective study on 100 professional players.,Am J Sports Med,Fousekis K and Tsepis E and Vagenas G,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Ankle sprain is an extremely common injury in soccer players. Despite extensive research, the intrinsic cause of this injury under noncontact conditions remains unclear. PURPOSE: To identify intrinsic risk factors for noncontact ankle sprains in professional soccer players. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2 METHODS: One hundred professional soccer players were assessed in the preseason for potential risk factors of noncontact ankle sprains. The assessment included (A) ankle joint asymmetries (right-left) in isokinetic muscle strength, flexibility, proprioception, and stability; (B) somatometric asymmetries; (C) previous injuries; and (D) lateral dominance traits. Noncontact ankle sprains were prospectively recorded and diagnosed for a full competition period (10 months). RESULTS: Seventeen of the players sustained at least 1 noncontact ankle sprain. Logistic regression revealed that players with (A) eccentric isokinetic ankle flexion strength asymmetries (odds ratio [OR] = 8.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.95-40.36, P = .005), (B) increased body mass index (OR = 8.16; 95% CI, 1.42-46.63, P = .018), and (C) increased body weight (OR = 5.72; 95% CI, 1.37-23.95, P = .017 ) each had a significantly higher risk of a noncontact ankle sprain. A trend for younger players (OR = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.061-1.24, P = .092) and for players with ankle laxity asymmetries (OR = 3.38; 95% CI, 0.82-14.00, P = .093) to be at greater risk for ankle sprain was also apparent to the limit of statistical significance (.05 < P < .10). CONCLUSION: Functional strength asymmetries of the ankle flexors and increased body mass index and body weight raise the propensity for ankle sprains in professional soccer players. Age and asymmetries in ankle laxity are potential factors worth revisiting, as there was an indication for younger players and players with ankle instability to be at higher risk for ankle injury.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, 5-site observational study of 512 infants aged 3 to 15 months with documented or likely allergy to milk or egg, and collected data prospectively examining allergic reactions. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 36 months (range: 0-48.4), the annualized reaction rate was 0.81 per year (367/512 subjects reporting 1171 reactions [95% confidence interval: 0.76-0.85]). Overall, 269/512 (52.5%) reported >1 reaction. The majority of reactions (71.2%) were triggered by milk (495 [42.3%]), egg (246 [21.0%]), and peanut (93 [7.9%]), with accidental exposures attributed to unintentional ingestion, label-reading errors, and cross-contact. Foods were provided by persons other than parents in 50.6% of reactions. Of 834 reactions to milk, egg, or peanut, 93 (11.2%) were attributed to purposeful exposures to these avoided foods. A higher number of food allergies (P < .0001) and higher food-specific immunoglobulin E (P < .0001) were associated with reactions. Of the 11.4% of reactions (n = 134) that were severe, 29.9% were treated with epinephrine. Factors resulting in undertreatment included lack of recognition of severity, epinephrine being unavailable, and fears about epinephrine administration. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high frequency of reactions caused by accidental and nonaccidental exposures. Undertreatment of severe reactions with epinephrine was a substantial problem. Areas for improved education include the need for constant vigilance, accurate label reading, avoidance of nonaccidental exposure, prevention of cross-contamination, appropriate epinephrine administration, and education of all caretakers.","Dermatitis, Atopic/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology Egg Hypersensitivity/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology Epinephrine/therapeutic use Female Follow-Up Studies Food Hypersensitivity/drug therapy/*epidemiology/etiology Health Surveys Humans Infant Male Milk Hypersensitivity/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology Peanut Hypersensitivity/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology Poisson Distribution Prospective Studies Questionnaires Regression Analysis Severity of Illness Index Sympathomimetics/therapeutic use United States/epidemiology"
22733561,"Fat or fit: the joint effects of physical activity, weight gain, and body size on breast cancer risk.",Cancer,McCullough LE and Eng SM and Bradshaw PT and Cleveland RJ and Teitelbaum SL and Neugut AI and Gammon MD,unc,"BACKGROUND: Although physical activity reduces breast cancer risk, issues critical to providing clear public health messages remain to be elucidated. These include the minimum duration and intensity necessary for risk reduction and the optimal time period for occurrence, as well as subgroup effects, particularly with regard to tumor heterogeneity and body size. METHODS: This study investigated the relationship between recreational physical activity (RPA) and breast cancer risk, in addition to characterizing the joint effects of activity level, weight gain, and body size, through use of a population-based sample of 1504 cases (N = 233 in situ, N = 1271 invasive) and 1555 controls (aged 20-98 years) from the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project, in Long Island, New York. RESULTS: A nonlinear dose-response association was observed between breast cancer risk and RPA during the reproductive period and after menopause. Women in the third quartile of activity experienced the greatest benefit with an approximate 30% risk reduction for reproductive (odds ratio = 0.67; 95% confidence interval = 0.48-0.94) and postmenopausal activity (odds ratio = 0.70; 95% confidence interval = 0.52-0.95). Little to no difference was observed regarding intensity of activity or hormone receptor status. Joint assessment of RPA, weight gain, and body size revealed that women with unfavorable energy balance profiles were at increased breast cancer risk. A significant multiplicative interaction was observed between RPA and adult weight gain (P = .033). CONCLUSIONS: RPA at any intensity level during the reproductive and postmenopausal years have the greatest benefit for reducing breast cancer risk. Substantial postmenopausal weight gain may eliminate the benefits of regular activity.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over *Body Mass Index Body Size Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/epidemiology/prevention & control Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/epidemiology/prevention & control Case-Control Studies Female Health Education Humans Medical Records Middle Aged New York/epidemiology Odds Ratio *Physical Exertion Postmenopause Premenopause *Recreation Risk Assessment Risk Factors *Weight Gain"

This number is likely to be only a fraction of the true number of the deaths associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1. We aimed to estimate the global number of deaths during the first 12 months of virus circulation in each country. METHODS: We calculated crude respiratory mortality rates associated with the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 strain by age (0-17 years, 18-64 years, and >64 years) using the cumulative (12 months) virus-associated symptomatic attack rates from 12 countries and symptomatic case fatality ratios (sCFR) from five high-income countries. To adjust crude mortality rates for differences between countries in risk of death from influenza, we developed a respiratory mortality multiplier equal to the ratio of the median lower respiratory tract infection mortality rate in each WHO region mortality stratum to the median in countries with very low mortality. We calculated cardiovascular disease mortality rates associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 infection with the ratio of excess deaths from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases during the pandemic in five countries and multiplied these values by the crude respiratory disease mortality rate associated with the virus. Respiratory and cardiovascular mortality rates associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 were multiplied by age to calculate the number of associated deaths. FINDINGS: We estimate that globally there were 201,200 respiratory deaths (range 105,700-395,600) with an additional 83,300 cardiovascular deaths (46,000-179,900) associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1. 80% of the respiratory and cardiovascular deaths were in people younger than 65 years and 51% occurred in southeast Asia and Africa. INTERPRETATION: Our estimate of respiratory and cardiovascular mortality associated with the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 was 15 times higher than reported laboratory-confirmed deaths. Although no estimates of sCFRs were available from Africa and southeast Asia, a disproportionate number of estimated pandemic deaths might have occurred in these regions. Therefore, efforts to prevent influenza need to effectively target these regions in future pandemics.

22732174,Early vaccinations are not risk factors for celiac disease.,Pediatrics,Myleus A and Stenlund H and Hernell O and Gothefors L and Hammarstrom ML and Persson LA and Ivarsson A,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate if changes in the national Swedish vaccination program coincided with changes in the celiac disease (CD) incidence rate in infants (ie, the Swedish CD Epidemic), and to assess the potential association between these vaccinations and CD risk. METHODS: All studies were based on the National Swedish Childhood Celiac Disease Register. Using an ecological approach, we plotted changes over time in the national vaccination program in the graph displaying CD incidence rate. A population-based incident case-referent study of invited infants was performed. Exposure information was received through a questionnaire and child health clinic records. Vaccines explored were diphtheria/tetanus, pertussis (acellular), polio (inactivated), Haemophilus influenzae type b (conjugated), measles/mumps/rubella, and live attenuated bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in children with increased tuberculosis risk. Findings were subjected to a birth cohort analysis. RESULTS: Introduction of pertussis vaccine coincided in time with decreasing CD incidence rates. In the infant case-referent study, however, neither vaccination against pertussis (odds ratio 0.91; 95% confidence interval 0.60-1.4), nor against Haemophilus influenzae type b or measles/mumps/rubella was associated with CD. Coverage for the diphtheria/tetanus and polio vaccines was 99%. BCG was associated with reduced risk for CD (adjusted odds ratio 0.54; 95% confidence interval 0.31-0.94). Discontinuation of general BCG vaccination did not affect the cumulative incidence of CD at age 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: Early vaccinations within the national Swedish program were not associated with CD risk, nor could changes in the program explain the Swedish epidemic. A protective effect by BCG was suggested, which could be subject to further studies.","Adolescent BCG Vaccine/administration & dosage/adverse effects Case-Control Studies Celiac Disease/epidemiology/*etiology Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis Vaccines/administration & dosage/adverse effects Epidemics Female Haemophilus influenzae type b/immunology Humans *Immunization Schedule Incidence Infant Influenza Vaccines/administration & dosage/adverse effects Logistic Models Male Mass Vaccination/*adverse effects Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine/administration & dosage/adverse effects Multivariate Analysis Poliovirus Vaccine, Inactivated/administration & dosage/adverse effects Registries Risk Factors Sweden/epidemiology"

22734032,Increasing lung cancer death rates among young women in southern and midwestern States.,J Clin Oncol,Jemal A and Ma J and Rosenberg PS and Siegel R and Anderson WF,cancer,"PURPOSE: Previous studies reported that declines in age-specific lung cancer death rates among women in the United States abruptly slowed in women younger than age 50 years (ie, women born after the 1950s). However, in view of substantial geographic differences in antitobacco measures and sociodemographic factors that affect smoking prevalence, it is unknown whether this change in the trend was similar across all states. METHODS: We examined female age-specific lung cancer death rates (1973 through 2007) by year of death and birth in each state by using age-period-cohort models. Cohort relative risks adjusted for age and period effects were used to compare the lung cancer death rate for a given birth cohort to a referent birth cohort (ie, the 1933 cohort herein). RESULTS: Age-specific lung cancer death rates declined continuously in white women in California, but the rates declined less quickly or even increased in the remaining states among women younger than age 50 years and women born after the 1950s, especially in several southern and midwestern states. For example, in some southern states (eg, Alabama), lung cancer death rates among women born in the 1960s were approximately double those of women born in the 1930s. CONCLUSION: The unfavorable lung cancer trend in white women born after circa 1950 in southern and midwestern states underscores the need for additional interventions to promote smoking cessation in these high-risk populations, which could lead to more favorable future mortality trends for lung cancer and other smoking-related diseases.","Adult Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Female Humans Lung Neoplasms/*mortality Male Middle Aged Smoking/adverse effects United States/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a nested case-control study to determine the association between leukotriene-modifying agents (LTMAs) and attempted suicide among asthmatic children and young adults. METHODS: Cases and control subjects were from a cohort of asthmatic patients aged 5 to 24 years who were new users of LTMAs or other asthma medications. Data were from an insurance claims database. Cases were defined as those with a suicide attempt (SA) occurring after exposure to asthma medication. Control subjects were persons at risk and were selected by using incidence density sampling in a 10:1 match. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine the association between LTMA exposure and the risk of attempted suicide adjusted for important covariates. RESULTS: We identified 344 cases and 3438 matched control subjects. Cases were more likely than control subjects to have risk factors for suicide. We found that current use of any LTMA was not associated with increased risk of an SA; in fact, the direction of effect was the opposite (adjusted odd ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.36-1.39). CONCLUSION: In this analysis we found that use of LTMAs was not associated with an increased risk of SAs in children, adolescents, and young adults with asthma. Further research needs to be conducted to more fully understand the association between LTMAs and suicide, particularly in subpopulations.","Adolescent Anti-Asthmatic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Asthma/drug therapy/epidemiology/metabolism/*psychology Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Databases, Factual Female Humans Incidence Leukotriene Antagonists/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Logistic Models Male Odds Ratio Receptors, Leukotriene/metabolism Risk Factors Suicide, Attempted/*statistics & numerical data United States/epidemiology United States Food and Drug Administration/legislation & jurisprudence Young Adult"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: PCa survivors (n = 529), 5 to 10 years postdiagnosis, were frequency-matched to noncancer controls (n = 514) for race, screening center, year of enrollment, and trial arm. Participants completed a telephone interview regarding PCa-specific symptomatology. Weights accounted for patient selection from the five PLCO screening centers. Propensity-score methods were used to balance groups of interest with respect to demographic and medical characteristics. RESULTS: Weighted linear regression analyses revealed poorer sexual and urinary function among PCa survivors compared with noncancer controls (P < .001). Trial arm was not significantly related to any outcome (P > .31). Compared with radical prostatectomy patients (n = 201), radiation-therapy patients (n = 110) reported better sexual (P < .05) and urinary (P < .001) functioning but poorer bowel outcomes (P < .05). Survivors who received treatment combinations including androgen deprivation (n = 207) reported significantly poorer hormone-related symptoms compared with radical prostatectomy patients (P < .05). CONCLUSION This study demonstrated the persistence of clinically significant, long-term PCa treatment-related sexual and urinary adverse effects up to 10 years postdiagnosis. To our knowledge, this was the first comparison of prostate-related dysfunction among screened survivors versus screened noncancer controls and indicated that these long-term problems were attributable to PCa treatment and not to aging or comorbidities. Finally, differences in long-term adverse effects between treatment modalities are particularly relevant for patients and clinicians when making treatment decisions.",Aged Colorectal Neoplasms/*diagnosis *Early Detection of Cancer Female Humans Linear Models Lung Neoplasms/*diagnosis Male Middle Aged Ovarian Neoplasms/*diagnosis Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy Survivors

METHODS: Two hundred fifty subjects ranging from normal weight to obese (body mass index range 16.9-59.1 kg/m(2) ) and no significant musculoskeletal disease were recruited from the general community and weight loss clinics and organizations. Seventy-eight percent were followed at ~2 years. Weight, height, and knee symptoms (using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) were assessed at baseline and followup. Any weight loss methods were recorded. RESULTS: Thirty percent of subjects lost >/=5% of baseline weight, 56% of subjects' weight remained stable (loss or gain of <5% of baseline weight), and 14% of subjects gained >/=5% of baseline weight. Using estimated marginal means, weight gain was associated with worsening pain (mean 27.1 mm; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] -1.1, 55.2), stiffness (mean 18.4 mm; 95% CI 1.5, 35.3), and function (mean 99.3 mm; 95% CI 4.0, 194.6) compared to stable weight. Weight loss was associated with reduced pain (mean -22.4 mm; 95% CI -44.4, -0.3), stiffness (mean -15.3 mm; 95% CI -28.50, -2.0), and function (mean -73.2 mm; 95% CI -147.9, 1.3) compared to stable weight. CONCLUSION: Weight gain was associated with adverse effects on knee symptoms, particularly in those who are obese and who have OA. Although losing weight is potentially beneficial for symptom improvement, the effects were more modest.

DESIGN: Participants were allocated randomly to one of two groups, to receive either a cessation advice report and progress report that were tailored to individual-level characteristics or a cessation advice report that presented standardized (non-tailored) content. Tailoring was based on smoking-related beliefs, personal characteristics and smoking patterns, self-efficacy and outcome expectations. SETTING: Participant enrolment and baseline assessments were conducted remotely online via the study website, with the advice reports presented by the same website. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n = 1758) were visitors to the QUIT website who were based in the United Kingdom, aged 18 years or over and who smoked cigarettes or hand-rolled tobacco. MEASUREMENTS: Follow-up assessments were made at 6 months by telephone interview. The primary outcome measure was self-reported 3 months prolonged abstinence, and secondary outcomes were 1 month prolonged abstinence, 7-day and 24-hour point prevalence abstinence. FINDINGS: The intervention group did not differ from the control group on the primary outcome (9.1% versus 9.3%; odds ratio = 1.02 95% confidence interval 0.73-1.42) or on any of the secondary outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: These observations were investigated by comparing Can f 1 (major dog [Canis familiaris] allergen) levels in hair and coat samples and in the home environment of various hypoallergenic (Labradoodle, Poodle, Spanish Waterdog, and Airedale terrier) and non-hypoallergenic dogs (Labrador retriever and a control group). METHODS: Hair and coat samples were obtained from dogs, and settled floor and airborne dust samples were taken from the dogs' homes. Can f 1 concentrations were measured by using ELISA, and results were analyzed by using multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Significantly higher Can f 1 concentrations were found in hair and coat samples of hypoallergenic dogs (n = 196, geometric mean [GM], 2.26 mug/g, geometric standard deviation [GSD], 0.73, and GM, 27.04 mug/g, GSD, 0.57, respectively) than of non-hypoallergenic dogs (n = 160, GM, 0.77 mug/g, GSD, 0.71, and GM, 12.98 mug/g, GSD, 0.76, respectively). Differences between breeds were small, relative to the variability within a breed. Can f 1 levels in settled floor dust samples were lower for Labradoodles, but no differences were found between the other groups. No differences in airborne levels were found between breeds. CONCLUSION: So-called hypoallergenic dogs had higher Can f 1 levels in hair and coat samples than did control breeds. These differences did not lead to higher levels of environmental exposure to dog allergens.

STUDY DESIGN: In this population-based case-control study conducted in Finland, 4713 cases born between 1987 and 2005 with International Classification of Diseases-diagnoses of childhood autism, Asperger syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), were ascertained from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Four controls, individually matched on sex, date of birth, and place of birth, were selected from the Finnish Medical Birth Register for each case. Conditional logistic regression models were used to assess whether birth weight and gestational age information predicted ASD after controlling for maternal age, parity, smoking during pregnancy, and psychiatric history, as well as for infant's major congenital anomalies. RESULTS: Very low (<1500 g) and moderately low (<2500 g) birth weight, very low gestational age (less than 32 weeks), and SGA increased risk of childhood autism (adjusted OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.4-6.5; 1.57, 1.1-2.3; 2.51, 1.3-5.0; and 1.72, 1.1-2.6, respectively). Very low and moderately low birth weight, very low gestational age, and SGA were also associated with increase in PDD risk (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.9-6.3; 1.81, 1.4-2.4; 2.46, 1.4-2.3; and 2.24, 1.7-3.0, respectively). No associations were found between the perinatal characteristics and Asperger syndrome. The increased risks persisted after controlling for selected potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that low birth weight, prematurity, and SGA were related to childhood autism and PDD but not to Asperger syndrome suggests that prenatal factors related to these exposures may differ for these ASD subtypes, which may have preventive implications.","Birth Weight Case-Control Studies Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/*diagnosis/etiology Child, Preschool Developmental Disabilities/diagnosis Female Finland Follow-Up Studies Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature, Diseases/*diagnosis Infant, Small for Gestational Age Male Registries Regression Analysis Risk Risk Factors"

It can be treated with post-prostatectomy surgical procedures. The long-term rate of patients who undergo these surgeries, including artificial urinary sphincter or urethral sling insertion, is not well described. We examined the long-term rate of post-prostatectomy incontinence surgery and factors influencing it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a population based study of 25,346 men who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in Ontario, Canada between 1993 and 2006. We used hospital and cancer registry administrative data to identify patients from this cohort who were later treated with surgery for urinary incontinence. RESULTS: Of the 25,346 patients 703 (2.8%) underwent artificial urinary sphincter insertion and 282 (1.1%) underwent urethral sling placement a median of 2.9 years after prostatectomy. The probability of an artificial urinary sphincter/sling procedure increased with time from prostatectomy. Cumulative 5, 10 and 15-year Kaplan-Meier rates of an artificial urinary sphincter/sling procedure were 2.6% (95% CI 2.4-2.8), 3.8% (95% CI 3.6-4.1) and 4.8% (95% CI 4.4-5.3), respectively. Factors predicting surgery for incontinence were patient age at radical prostatectomy (HR 1.24 per decade, 95% CI 1.11-1.38, p = 0.0002), radiotherapy after surgery (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.36-1.90, p <0.0001) and surgeon volume (49 or greater prostatectomies per year) (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46-0.77, p <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Of patients who undergo radical prostatectomy 5% are expected to be treated with surgery for urinary incontinence during a 15-year period.

Our objective was to compare morbidity and long-term survival of Witnesses undergoing cardiac surgery with a similarly matched group of patients who received transfusions. METHODS: A total of 322 Witnesses and 87 453 non-Witnesses underwent cardiac surgery at our center from January 1, 1983, to January 1, 2011. All Witnesses prospectively refused blood transfusions. Among non-Witnesses, 38 467 did not receive blood transfusions and 48 986 did. We used propensity methods to match patient groups and parametric multiphase hazard methods to assess long-term survival. Our main outcome measures were postoperative morbidity complications, in-hospital mortality, and long-term survival. RESULTS: Witnesses had fewer acute complications and shorter length of stay than matched patients who received transfusions: myocardial infarction, 0.31% vs 2.8% (P = . 01); additional operation for bleeding, 3.7% vs 7.1% (P = . 03); prolonged ventilation, 6% vs 16% (P < . 001); intensive care unit length of stay (15th, 50th, and 85th percentiles), 24, 25, and 72 vs 24, 48, and 162 hours (P < . 001); and hospital length of stay (15th, 50th, and 85th percentiles), 5, 7, and 11 vs 6, 8, and 16 days (P < . 001).

However, due to risks of random integration of the reprogramming transgenes into the host genome, the low efficiency of the process, and the potential risk of virally induced tumorigenicity, alternative methods have been developed to generate pluripotent cells using nonintegrating systems, albeit with limited success. Here, we show that c-KIT+ human first-trimester amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSCs) can be fully reprogrammed to pluripotency without ectopic factors, by culture on Matrigel in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) medium supplemented with the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) valproic acid (VPA). The cells share 82% transcriptome identity with hESCs and are capable of forming embryoid bodies (EBs) in vitro and teratomas in vivo. After long-term expansion, they maintain genetic stability, protein level expression of key pluripotency factors, high cell-division kinetics, telomerase activity, repression of X-inactivation, and capacity to differentiate into lineages of the three germ layers, such as definitive endoderm, hepatocytes, bone, fat, cartilage, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. We conclude that AFSC can be utilized for cell banking of patient-specific pluripotent cells for potential applications in allogeneic cellular replacement therapies, pharmaceutical screening, and disease modeling.","Amniotic Fluid/cytology/*drug effects Cell Differentiation Cell Line DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism Female Genome, Human Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism Humans Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism Karyotyping Kinetics Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism Male Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/metabolism Phenotype SOXB1 Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism Sequence Analysis, DNA Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism Transcriptome Transgenes Valproic Acid/*pharmacology X Chromosome Inactivation/drug effects"
22753560,Two-year follow-up of an adolescent behavioral weight control intervention.,Pediatrics,Lloyd-Richardson EE and Jelalian E and Sato AF and Hart CN and Mehlenbeck R and Wing RR,umassd,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined the 24-month outcomes of a randomized controlled trial of a group-based behavioral weight control (BWC) program combined with either activity-based peer intervention or aerobic exercise. METHODS: At baseline, 118 obese adolescents (68% female; BMI = 31.41 +/- 3.33) ages 13 to 16 years (mean = 14.33; SD = 1.02) were randomized to receive 1 of 2 weight loss interventions. Both interventions received the same 16-week group-based cognitive-behavioral treatment, combined with either aerobic exercise or peer-based adventure therapy. Eighty-nine adolescents (75% of original sample) completed the 24-month follow-up. Anthropometric and psychosocial measures were obtained at baseline, at the end of the 16-week intervention, and at 12 and 24 months following randomization. RESULTS: An intent-to-treat mixed factor analysis of variance indicated a significant effect for time on both percent over 50th percentile BMI for age and gender and standardized BMI score, with no differences by intervention group. Post hoc comparisons showed a significant decrease in percent overweight at 4 months (end of treatment), which was maintained at both 12- and 24-month follow-up visits. Significant improvements on several dimensions of self-concept were noted, with significant effects on physical appearance self-concept that were maintained through 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Both BWC conditions were effective at maintaining reductions in adolescent obesity and improvements in physical appearance self-concept through 24-month follow-up. This study is one of the first to document long-term outcomes of BWC intervention among adolescents.","Adolescent Body Mass Index *Cognitive Therapy Cohort Studies *Exercise Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Massachusetts Obesity/psychology/*therapy *Peer Group *Problem-Based Learning *Psychotherapy, Group Self Concept Self Efficacy *Weight Loss *Wilderness"

Our objective was to examine the im-pact of national health policies on African American and white children's receipt of dental care from 1964 to 2010. METHODS: We analyzed data on race and dental care utilization for children aged 2 to 17 years from the 1964, 1976, 1989, 1999, and 2010 National Health Interview Survey. Dependent variables were as follows: child's receipt of a dental visit in the previous 12 months and child's history of never having had a dental visit. Primary independent variable was race (African American/white). We calculated sample prevalences, and chi(2) tests compared African American/white prevalences by year. We age-standardized estimates to the 2000 US Census. RESULTS: The percentage of African American and white children in the United States without a dental visit in the previous 12 months declined significantly from 52.4% in 1964 to 21.7% in 2010, whereas the percentage of children who had never had a dental visit declined significantly (P < .01) from 33.6% to 10.6%. Pronounced African American/white disparities in children's dental utilization rates, whereas large and statistically significant in 1964, attenuated and became nonsignificant by 2010. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a dramatic narrowing of African American/white disparities in 2 measures of children's receipt of dental services from 1964 to 2010. Yet, much more needs to be done before persistent racial disparities in children's oral health status are eliminated.","Adolescent African Americans/*statistics & numerical data Child Child, Preschool Dental Care for Children/*trends European Continental Ancestry Group/*statistics & numerical data Female Health Surveys Healthcare Disparities/*ethnology/*trends Humans Male Oral Health/ethnology/trends United States Utilization Review"

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of maternal use of antipsychotics during pregnancy on gestational diabetes and fetal growth. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study comparing women exposed and not exposed to antipsychotics during pregnancy. Exposure was defined as prescriptions filled. SETTING: Swedish national health registers. PARTICIPANTS: All women giving birth in Sweden from July 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009, grouped by filled prescriptions for (1) olanzapine and/or clozapine, the most obesogenic and diabetogenic antipsychotics (n = 169), (2) other antipsychotics (n = 338), or (3) no antipsychotics (n = 357,696). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for gestational diabetes and being small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age for birth weight, birth length, and head circumference. RESULTS: Exposure to other antipsychotics was associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes (adjusted OR, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.04-3.03]). The risk increase with olanzapine and/or clozapine was of similar magnitude but not statistical significance (adjusted OR, 1.94 [95% CI, 0.97-3.91]). Infants exposed to either group of antipsychotics had increased risks of being SGA on birth weight, whereas only exposure to other antipsychotics yielded increased risks of being SGA for birth length and head circumference. None of the risks for SGA measurements remained significant after adjusting for maternal factors. There were no increased risks of being large for gestational age for birth weight or birth length after exposure to olanzapine and/or clozapine, but the risk increased for head circumference (OR, 3.02 [95% CI, 1.60-5.71]). CONCLUSIONS: Women who used antipsychotics during pregnancy had increased risks of gestational diabetes. The increased risks of giving birth to an SGA infant seemed to be an effect of confounders, such as smoking. Except for macrocephaly, olanzapine and/or clozapine exposure was not associated with anabolic fetal growth.","Adult Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use Cephalometry Diabetes, Gestational/*chemically induced Drug Prescriptions Female Humans Infant, Newborn Infant, Small for Gestational Age Male Pregnancy Registries Risk Sweden"
22700779,Is sleep apnea a winter disease?: meteorologic and sleep laboratory evidence collected over 1 decade.,Chest,Cassol CM and Martinez D and da Silva FA and Fischer MK and Lenz Mdo C and Bos AJ,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The severity of obstructive sleep apnea increases by influence of conditions that are more frequent in winter. The hypothesis that the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of different patients undergoing polysomnography may be seasonally affected was tested. METHODS: The retrospectively analyzed database included 7,523 patients of both sexes who underwent in-laboratory baseline polysomnography to investigate any complaint of disordered sleep, during 1 decade, between January 2000 and December 2009. Data on climate and air pollution were obtained from official organizations. AHI was the main outcome variable. Cosinor analysis, a statistical method for the investigation of time series, was used to detect seasonality. RESULTS: The cosinor analysis confirmed the existence of a circannual pattern of AHI, with acrophase in winter and nadir during the summer. The seasonality is significant even after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, neck circumference, and relative air humidity. Median (25-75 interquartile range) AHI in the 6 months with colder weather was 17.8 (6.5-40.6/h), and in the warmer weather was 15.0 (5.7-33.2/h). The AHI correlated inversely with ambient temperature and directly with atmospheric pressure, relative air humidity, and carbon monoxide levels. Correlations with precipitation, particulate air matter < 10 mum, sulfur dioxide, and ozone were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: More sleep-disordered breathing events were recorded in winter than in other seasons. Cosinor analysis uncovered a significant seasonal pattern in the AHI of different patients undergoing polysomnography, independent of sex, age, BMI, neck circumference, and relative air humidity. This finding suggests that obstructive sleep apnea severity may be associated with other seasonal epidemiologic phenomena.","Adult Age Factors Body Mass Index Female Humans Humidity Male Middle Aged Neck/anatomy & histology *Polysomnography Prevalence Retrospective Studies *Seasons *Severity of Illness Index Sex Factors Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/*diagnosis/*epidemiology"
22705832,Does the number of rescuers affect the survival rate from out-of-hospital cardiac arrests? Two or more rescuers are not always better than one.,Resuscitation,Nishi T and Maeda T and Takase K and Kamikura T and Tanaka Y and Inaba H,Missing,"REVIEW: An increased number of rescuers may improve the survival rate from out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs). The majority of OHCAs occur at home and are handled by family members. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 5078 OHCAs that were witnessed by citizens and unwitnessed by citizens or emergency medical technicians from January 2004 to March 2010 were prospectively collected. The number of rescuers was identified in 4338 OHCAs and was classified into two (single rescuer (N=2468) and multiple rescuers (N=1870)) or three (single rescuer, two rescuers (N=887) and three or more rescuers (N=983)) groups. The backgrounds, characteristics and outcomes of OHCAs were compared between the two groups and among the three groups. RESULTS: When all OHCAs were collectively analysed, an increased number of rescuers was associated with better outcomes (one-year survival and one-year survival with favourable neurological outcomes were 3.1% and 1.9% for single rescuers, 4.1% and 2.0% for two rescuers, and 6.0% and 4.6% for three or more rescuers, respectively (p=0.0006 and p<0.0001)). A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of multiple rescuers is an independent factor that is associated with one-year survival (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.539 (1.088-2.183)). When only OHCAs that occurred at home were analysed (N=2902), the OHCAs that were handled by multiple rescuers were associated with higher incidences of bystander CPR but were not associated with better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, an increased number of rescuers improves the outcomes of OHCAs. However, this beneficial effect is absent in OHCAs that occur at home.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Emergency Medical Services/*statistics & numerical data Emergency Medical Technicians/*statistics & numerical data Female Humans Male Middle Aged Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/*mortality/*therapy Prospective Studies Survival Rate"

They include preventable or ameliorable adverse drug events (ADEs), as well as medication discrepancies or nonadherence with high potential for future harm (potential ADEs). OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a tailored intervention on the occurrence of clinically important medication errors after hospital discharge. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial with concealed allocation and blinded outcome assessors. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00632021) SETTING: Two tertiary care academic hospitals. PATIENTS: Adults hospitalized with acute coronary syndromes or acute decompensated heart failure. INTERVENTION: Pharmacist-assisted medication reconciliation, inpatient pharmacist counseling, low-literacy adherence aids, and individualized telephone follow-up after discharge. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the number of clinically important medication errors per patient during the first 30 days after hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included preventable or ameliorable ADEs, as well as potential ADEs. RESULTS: Among 851 participants, 432 (50.8%) had 1 or more clinically important medication errors; 22.9% of such errors were judged to be serious and 1.8% life-threatening. Adverse drug events occurred in 258 patients (30.3%) and potential ADEs in 253 patients (29.7%). The intervention did not significantly alter the per-patient number of clinically important medication errors (unadjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.10]) or ADEs (unadjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.09 [CI, 0.86 to 1.39]). Patients in the intervention group tended to have fewer potential ADEs (unadjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.80 [CI, 0.61 to 1.04]). LIMITATION: The characteristics of the study hospitals and participants may limit generalizability. CONCLUSION: Clinically important medication errors were present among one half of patients after hospital discharge and were not significantly reduced by a health-literacy-sensitive, pharmacist-delivered intervention.

The degree to which these disorders share a basis in etiology has important implications for clinicians, researchers, and those affected by the disorders. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a family history of schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder is a risk factor for ASD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a case-control evaluation of histories of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in first-degree relatives of probands in 3 samples-population registers in Sweden, Stockholm County (in Sweden), and Israel. Probands met criteria for ASD, and affection status of parents and siblings for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were established. RESULTS: The presence of schizophrenia in parents was associated with an increased risk for ASD in a Swedish national cohort (odds ratio [OR], 2.9; 95% CI, 2.5-3.4) and a Stockholm County cohort (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.0-4.1). Similarly, schizophrenia in a sibling was associated with an increased risk for ASD in a Swedish national cohort (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.0-3.2) and an Israeli conscription cohort (OR, 12.1; 95% CI, 4.5-32.0). Bipolar disorder showed a similar pattern of associations but of lesser magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from these 3 registers along with consistent findings from a similar study in Denmark suggest that ASD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder share common etiologic factors.","Adolescent Adult Asperger Syndrome/genetics Bipolar Disorder/*genetics Case-Control Studies Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/*genetics Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics Humans Infant Intellectual Disability/genetics Israel Male Phenotype Registries Risk Factors Schizophrenia/*genetics Sweden"

No nationwide study describing CL injury has ever been done. PURPOSE: To study the incidence and characteristics of patients diagnosed with cruciate ligament injury in Sweden. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: Data for all patients with a diagnosed CL injury between 2001 and 2009 were identified from the National Swedish Patient Register. Risk analysis and specific incidences were calculated according to age, sex, geographic region, and surgery. RESULTS: A total number of 56,659 patients with CL injury were included in the study, and the overall incidence of CL injury in Sweden was 78 per 100,000 persons. Sixty percent of the patients were male. The mean age was 32 years (range, 1-98 years), and 50% of the cohort was younger than 30 years. There was an increased rate of injury among female patients younger than 20 years as compared with male patients in that age group. Among patients with CL injury, 36% underwent reconstructive surgery, with one-third of these performed within 1 year after injury. Among patients who underwent surgery, 59% were male; the mean age was 27 years (range, 5-89 years). CONCLUSION: This study defines the incidence of CL injury and also demonstrates sex differences in which men were more likely to sustain a CL injury, although female patients were injured at an earlier age. The findings in this study corroborate the results from recent surgical registers. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: No data have hitherto been published including all patients with CL injury, treated both surgically and nonsurgically. Such baseline epidemiologic data are crucial to be able to validate and judge the generalizability of results from procedure registers and clinical studies.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Anterior Cruciate Ligament/*injuries/*surgery Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction/*statistics & numerical data Child Child, Preschool Female Humans Incidence Infant Knee Injuries/*epidemiology Male Middle Aged *Registries Sex Factors Sweden/epidemiology Young Adult"
22717218,Do dietary supplements improve micronutrient sufficiency in children and adolescents?,J Pediatr,Bailey RL and Fulgoni VL 3rd and Keast DR and Lentino CV and Dwyer JT,nih,"OBJECTIVE: To examine if children use supplements to fill gaps in nutritionally inadequate diets or whether supplements contribute to already adequate or excessive micronutrient intakes from foods. STUDY DESIGN: Data were analyzed for children (2-18 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006, a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey (n = 7250). Diet was assessed using two 24-hour recalls, and dietary supplement use was assessed with a 30-day questionnaire. RESULTS: Prevalence of supplements use was 21% (<2 years) and 42% (2-8 years). Supplement users had higher micronutrient intakes than nonusers. Calcium and vitamin D intakes were low for all children. Inadequate intakes of phosphorus, copper, selenium, folate, and vitamins B-6 and B-12 were minimal from foods alone among 2-8 year olds. However, among 9-18 year olds, a higher prevalence of inadequate intakes of magnesium, phosphorus, and vitamins A, C, and E were observed. Supplement use increased the likelihood of intakes above the upper tolerable intake level for iron, zinc, copper, selenium, folic acid, and vitamins A and C. CONCLUSIONS: Even with the use of supplements, more than a one-third of children failed to meet calcium and vitamin D recommendations. Children 2-8 years old had nutritionally adequate diets regardless of supplement use. However, in children older than 8 years, dietary supplements added micronutrients to diets that would have otherwise been inadequate for magnesium, phosphorus, vitamins A, C, and E. Supplement use contributed to the potential for excess intakes of some nutrients. These findings may have implications for reformulating dietary supplements for children.","Adolescent Calcium/metabolism Child Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Diet *Dietary Supplements Ethnic Groups Female Humans Male *Micronutrients Nutrition Surveys Nutritional Requirements Prevalence Questionnaires United States Vitamin D/metabolism Vitamins"
22777988,Visibility of the urethral meatus and risk of urinary tract infections in uncircumcised boys.,CMAJ,Dubrovsky AS and Foster BJ and Jednak R and Mok E and McGillivray D,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Uncircumcised boys are at higher risk for urinary tract infections than circumcised boys. Whether this risk varies with the visibility of the urethral meatus is not known. Our aim was to determine whether there is a hierarchy of risk among uncircumcised boys whose urethral meatuses are visible to differing degrees. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study in one pediatric emergency department. We screened 440 circumcised and uncircumcised boys. Of these, 393 boys who were not toilet trained and for whom the treating physician had requested a catheter urine culture were included in our analysis. At the time of catheter insertion, a nurse characterized the visibility of the urethral meatus (phimosis) using a 3-point scale (completely visible, partially visible or nonvisible). Our primary outcome was urinary tract infection, and our primary exposure variable was the degree of phimosis: completely visible versus partially or nonvisible urethral meatus. RESULTS: Cultures grew from urine samples from 30.0% of uncircumcised boys with a completely visible meatus, and from 23.8% of those with a partially or nonvisible meatus (p = 0.4). The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for culture growth was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35-1.52), and the adjusted OR was 0.41 (95% CI 0.17-0.95). Of the boys who were circumcised, 4.8% had urinary tract infections, which was significantly lower than the rate among uncircumcised boys with a completely visible urethral meatus (unadjusted OR 0.12 [95% CI 0.04-0.39], adjusted OR 0.07 [95% CI 0.02-0.26]). INTERPRETATION: We did not see variation in the risk of urinary tract infection with the visibility of the urethral meatus among uncircumcised boys. Compared with circumcised boys, we saw a higher risk of urinary tract infection in uncircumcised boys, irrespective of urethral visibility.","Child, Preschool *Circumcision, Male Cross-Sectional Studies Humans Infant Male Prospective Studies Risk Factors Urethra/*anatomy & histology Urinary Catheterization Urinary Tract Infections/*diagnosis/*etiology Urine/microbiology"
22777008,Dying for the weekend: a retrospective cohort study on the association between day of hospital presentation and the quality and safety of stroke care.,Arch Neurol,Palmer WL and Bottle A and Davie C and Vincent CA and Aylin P,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between day of admission and measures of the quality and safety of the care received by patients with stroke. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to hospitals with stroke (codes I60-I64 from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Version) from April 1, 2009, through March 31, 2010. SETTING: English National Health Service public hospitals. PATIENTS: PATIENTS during the study period accounted for 93 621 admissions. We used logistic regression to adjust the outcome measures for case mix. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality and safety measurements using 6 indicators spanning the hospital care pathway, from timely brain scans to emergency readmissions after discharge. RESULTS: Performance across 5 of the 6 measures was significantly lower on weekends (confidence level, 99%). One of the largest disparities was seen in rates of same-day brain scans, which were 43.1% on weekends compared with 47.6% on weekdays (unadjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.81-0.86]). In particular, the rate of 7-day in-hospital mortality for Sunday admissions was 11.0% (adjusted odds ratio, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.16-1.37], with Monday used as a reference) compared with a mean of 8.9% for weekday admissions. CONCLUSIONS: Strong evidence suggests that, nationally, stroke patients admitted on weekends are less likely to receive urgent treatments and have worse outcomes across a range of indicators. Although we adjusted the results for case mix, we cannot rule out some of the effect being due to unmeasured differences in patients admitted on weekends compared with weekdays. The findings suggest that approximately 350 in-hospital deaths each year within 7 days are potentially avoidable, and an additional 650 people could be discharged to their usual place of residence within 56 days if the performance seen on weekdays was replicated on weekends.",Adult *After-Hours Care/statistics & numerical data Aged Brain/pathology Cohort Studies England Female Health Services *Hospital Mortality Humans Logistic Models Male Patient Admission/*statistics & numerical data *Quality of Health Care Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Stroke/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy

We prospectively investigated the association between maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and children's problem behavior at age 5 to 6 years. Mediation by fetal growth restriction and gestational age as well as effect modification by the child's gender and maternal smoking was tested. METHODS: In a community based multiethnic birth cohort, dietary caffeine intake (coffee, caffeinated tea, and cola) was measured (maternal self-report, n = 8202) around the 16th week of gestation. At age 5, children's overall problem behavior, emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention problems, peer relationship problems, and prosocial behavior were rated by both mother and teacher (n = 3439) with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Analyses were adjusted for maternal age, ethnicity, cohabitant status, education, smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy, child's gender, family size, and prenatal maternal anxiety. RESULTS: Caffeine intake was not associated with a higher risk for behavior problems or with suboptimal prosocial behavior. No evidence was found for mediation by fetal growth restriction or gestational age, nor for effect modification by the child's gender. CONCLUSIONS: Results did not provide evidence for developmental programming influences of intrauterine exposure to caffeine on offspring's problem behavior at age 5. Present results give no indication to advise pregnant women to reduce their caffeine intake to prevent behavior problems in their children.","Affective Symptoms/chemically induced/epidemiology Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/chemically induced/epidemiology Caffeine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Child Child Behavior Disorders/*chemically induced/epidemiology Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Conduct Disorder/chemically induced/epidemiology Cross-Sectional Studies Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Female Humans Infant, Newborn Male Peer Group Personality Assessment Pregnancy *Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects Prospective Studies Risk Smoking/adverse effects Social Adjustment Socialization"
22786596,A randomized trial of stress management for the prevention of new brain lesions in MS.,Neurology,Mohr DC and Lovera J and Brown T and Cohen B and Neylan T and Henry R and Siddique J and Jin L and Daikh D and Pelletier D,northwestern,"OBJECTIVES: This trial examined the efficacy of a stress management program in reducing neuroimaging markers of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity. METHODS: A total of 121 patients with relapsing forms of MS were randomized to receive stress management therapy for MS (SMT-MS) or a wait-list control condition. SMT-MS provided 16 individual treatment sessions over 24 weeks, followed by a 24-week post-treatment follow-up. The primary outcome was the cumulative number of new gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) brain lesions on MRI at weeks 8, 16, and 24. Secondary outcomes included new or enlarging T2 MRI lesions, brain volume change, clinical exacerbation, and stress. RESULTS: SMT-MS resulted in a reduction in cumulative Gd+ lesions (p = 0.04) and greater numbers of participants remained free of Gd+ lesions during the treatment (76.8% vs 54.7%, p = 0.02), compared to participants receiving the control treatment. SMT-MS also resulted in significantly reduced numbers of cumulative new T2 lesions (p = 0.005) and a greater number of participants remaining free of new T2 lesions (69.5% vs 42.7%, p = 0.006). These effects were no longer detectable during the 24-week post-treatment follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: This trial indicates that SMT-MS may be useful in reducing the development of new MRI brain lesions while patients are in treatment. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that SMT-MS, a manualized stress management therapy program, reduced the number of Gd+ lesions in patients with MS during a 24-week treatment period. This benefit was not sustained beyond 24 weeks, and there were no clinical benefits.

The age-specific prevalence of Alzheimer's disease nearly doubles every 5 years after age 65, leading to a prevalence of greater than 25% in those over the age of 90 (ref. 3). Here, to search for low-frequency variants in the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) gene with a significant effect on the risk of Alzheimer's disease, we studied coding variants in APP in a set of whole-genome sequence data from 1,795 Icelanders. We found a coding mutation (A673T) in the APP gene that protects against Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline in the elderly without Alzheimer's disease. This substitution is adjacent to the aspartyl protease beta-site in APP, and results in an approximately 40% reduction in the formation of amyloidogenic peptides in vitro. The strong protective effect of the A673T substitution against Alzheimer's disease provides proof of principle for the hypothesis that reducing the beta-cleavage of APP may protect against the disease. Furthermore, as the A673T allele also protects against cognitive decline in the elderly without Alzheimer's disease, the two may be mediated through the same or similar mechanisms.","Aging/*genetics Alleles Alzheimer Disease/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology/prevention & control Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/metabolism Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases/metabolism Cognition/physiology Cognition Disorders/*genetics/*physiopathology/prevention & control Genetic Predisposition to Disease HEK293 Cells Humans Mutation/*genetics Plaque, Amyloid/genetics/metabolism"

22778124,"Chemical intolerance in primary care settings: prevalence, comorbidity, and outcomes.",Ann Fam Med,Katerndahl DA and Bell IR and Palmer RF and Miller CS,uthscsa,"PURPOSE: This study extends previous community-based studies on the prevalence and clinical characteristics of chemical intolerance in a sample of primary care clinic patients. We evaluated comorbid medical and psychiatric disorders, functional status, and rates of health care use. METHODS: A total of 400 patients were recruited from 2 family medicine clinic waiting rooms in San Antonio, Texas. Patients completed the validated Quick Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory (QEESI) to assess chemical intolerance; the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) screen for possible psychiatric disorders; the Dartmouth-Northern New England Primary Care Cooperative Information Project (Dartmouth COOP) charts for functional status; and the Healthcare Utilization Questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall, 20.3% of the sample met criteria for chemical intolerance. The chemically intolerant group reported significantly higher rates of comorbid allergies and more often met screening criteria for possible major depressive disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and alcohol abuse disorder, as well as somatization disorder. The total number of possible mental disorders was correlated with chemical intolerance scores (P <.001). Controlling for demographics, patients with chemical intolerance were significantly more likely to have poorer functional status, with trends toward increased medical service use when compared with non-chemically intolerant patients. After controlling for comorbid psychiatric conditions, the groups differed significantly only regarding limitations of social activities. CONCLUSIONS: Chemical intolerance occurs in 1 of 5 primary care patients yet is rarely diagnosed by busy practitioners. Psychiatric comorbidities contribute to functional limitations and increased health care use. Chemical intolerance offers an etiologic explanation. Symptoms may resolve or improve with the avoidance of salient chemical, dietary (including caffeine and alcohol), and drug triggers. Given greater medication intolerances in chemical intolerance, primary care clinicians could use the QEESI to identify patients for appropriate triage to comprehensive nonpharmacologic care.","Analysis of Variance Chi-Square Distribution Comorbidity Female Humans Male Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/psychology Middle Aged Multiple Chemical Sensitivity/*epidemiology/psychology Odds Ratio Physicians, Primary Care Prevalence Primary Health Care/*methods Psychometrics Questionnaires Self Report Statistics as Topic Texas/epidemiology *Treatment Outcome"
22730275,Association of herbal cannabis use with negative psychosocial parameters in patients with fibromyalgia.,Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken),Ste-Marie PA and Fitzcharles MA and Gamsa A and Ware MA and Shir Y,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with chronic pain, including fibromyalgia (FM), may seek treatments outside of mainstream medicine. Medicinal cannabinoids are popularly advocated for pain relief but with limited evidence for efficacy in FM. The extent of use of cannabinoids in FM is unknown. METHODS: We have documented the self-reported prevalence of cannabinoid use in 457 patients with the diagnosis of FM and referred to a tertiary care pain center. We validated the diagnosis of FM and examined the associations of cannabinoid use in these patients. RESULTS: Cannabinoids were being used by 13% of all patients, of whom 80% used herbal cannabis (marijuana), 24% used prescription cannabinoids, and 3% used both herbal cannabis and prescription cannabinoids. One-third of all men used cannabinoids. Current unstable mental illness (36% versus 23%; P = 0.002), opioid drug-seeking behavior (17% versus 4%; P = 0.002), and male sex (26% versus 7%; P = 0.0002) were all associated with herbal cannabis use. There was a trend for cannabinoid users to be unemployed and receiving disability payments. The diagnosis of FM was validated in 302 patients, with 155 assigned another primary diagnosis. When the FM group was analyzed separately, significant associations were lost, but trends remained. CONCLUSION: Cannabinoids were used by 13% of patients referred with a diagnosis of FM. The association of herbal cannabis use with negative psychosocial parameters raises questions regarding the motive for this self-medication practice. Although cannabinoids may offer some therapeutic effect, caution regarding any recommendation should be exercised pending clarification of general health and psychosocial problems, especially for those self-medicating.",Adult Cannabinoids/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Cannabis Chronic Pain/drug therapy/epidemiology/psychology Cohort Studies Female Fibromyalgia/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*psychology Humans Male Marijuana Smoking/*adverse effects Middle Aged Prevalence Psychology Retrospective Studies Self Medication/adverse effects/methods
22778119,Interactive preventive health record to enhance delivery of recommended care: a randomized trial.,Ann Fam Med,Krist AH and Woolf SH and Rothemich SF and Johnson RE and Peele JE and Cunningham TD and Longo DR and Bello GA and Matzke GR,vcu,"PURPOSE: Americans receive only one-half of recommended preventive services. Information technologies have been advocated to engage patients. We tested the effectiveness of an interactive preventive health record (IPHR) that links patients to their clinician's record, explains information in lay language, displays tailored recommendations and educational resources, and generates reminders. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial involved 8 primary care practices. Four thousand five hundred patients were randomly selected to receive a mailed invitation to use the IPHR or usual care. Outcomes were measured using patient surveys and electronic medical record data and included IPHR use and service delivery. Comparisons were made between invited and usual-care patients and between users and nonusers among those invited to use the IPHR. RESULTS: At 4 and 16 months, 229 (10.2%) and 378 (16.8%) of invited patients used the IPHR. The proportion of patients up-to-date with all services increased between baseline and 16 months by 3.8% among intervention patients (from 11.4% to 15.2%, P <.001) and by 1.5% among control patients (from 11.1% to 12.6%, P = .07), a difference of 2.3% (P = .05). Greater increases were observed among patients who used the IPHR. At 16 months, 25.1% of users were up-to-date with all services, double the rate among nonusers. At 4 months, delivery of colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening increased by 19%, 15%, and 13%, respectively, among users. CONCLUSIONS: Information systems that feature patient-centered functionality, such as the IPHR, have potential to increase preventive service delivery.

The aim of this study was to determine the annual in-hospital mortality rates of patients with cardiac arrest from 2001 to 2009. METHODS AND RESULTS: The US mortality rates for hospitalized patients with cardiac arrest were determined using the 2001 to 2009 US National Inpatient Sample, a national hospital discharge database. Using the International Classification of Diseases, 9(th) Edition, code 427.5, we identified patients hospitalized in the United States with cardiac arrest from 2001 to 2009. The main outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. A total of 1 190 860 patients were hospitalized with a diagnosis of cardiac arrest in the United States from 2001 to 2009. The in-hospital mortality rate decreased each year from 69.6% in 2001 to 57.8% in 2009. In multivariable analysis, when controlling for age, sex, race, and comorbidities, earlier year was a strong independent predictor of in-hospital death. The mortality rate declined across all analyzed subgroups, including sex, age, race, and stratification by comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: The in-hospital mortality rate of patients hospitalized with cardiac arrest in the United States decreased by 11.8% from 2001 to 2009.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Databases, Factual Female Heart Arrest/*epidemiology/*mortality Hospital Mortality/*trends Humans Male Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Retrospective Studies Survival Rate United States/epidemiology"
22760571,Energy intake and expenditure during sedentary screen time and motion-controlled video gaming.,Am J Clin Nutr,Lyons EJ and Tate DF and Ward DS and Wang X,utmb,"BACKGROUND: Television watching and playing of video games (VGs) are associated with higher energy intakes. Motion-controlled video games (MC) may be a healthier alternative to sedentary screen-based activities because of higher energy expenditures, but little is known about the effects of these games on energy intakes. OBJECTIVE: Energy intake, expenditure, and surplus (intake - expenditure) were compared during sedentary (television and VG) and active (MC) screen-time use. DESIGN: Young adults (n = 120; 60 women) were randomly assigned to the following 3 groups: television watching, playing traditional VGs, or playing MCs for 1 h while snacks and beverages were provided. Energy intakes, energy expenditures, and appetites were measured. RESULTS: Intakes across these 3 groups showed a trend toward a significant difference (P = 0.065). The energy expenditure (P < 0.001) was higher, and the energy surplus (P = 0.038) was lower, in MC than in television or VG groups. All conditions produced a mean (+/-SD) energy surplus as follows: 638 +/- 408 kcal in television, 655 +/- 533 kcal in VG, and 376 +/- 487 kcal in MC groups. The OR for consuming >/=500 kcal in the television compared with the MC group was 3.2 (95% CI: 1.2, 8.4). Secondary analyses, in which the 2 sedentary conditions were collapsed, showed an intake that was 178 kcal (95% CI: 8, 349 kcal) lower in the MC condition than in the sedentary groups (television and VG). CONCLUSION: MCs may be a healthier alternative to sedentary screen time because of a lower energy surplus, but the playing of these games still resulted in a positive energy balance.

In 2006, New York City (NYC) passed the first regulation in the United States restricting trans fat use in restaurants. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of the NYC regulation on the trans and saturated fat content of fast-food purchases. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study that included purchase receipts matched to available nutritional information and brief surveys of adult lunchtime restaurant customers conducted in 2007 and 2009, before and after implementation of the regulation. SETTING: 168 randomly selected NYC restaurant locations of 11 fast-food chains. PARTICIPANTS: Adult restaurant customers interviewed in 2007 and 2009. MEASUREMENTS: Change in mean grams of trans fat, saturated fat, trans plus saturated fat, and trans fat per 1000 kcal per purchase, overall and by chain type. RESULTS: The final sample included 6969 purchases in 2007 and 7885 purchases in 2009. Overall, mean trans fat per purchase decreased by 2.4 g (95% CI, -2.8 to -2.0 g; P < 0.001), whereas saturated fat showed a slight increase of 0.55 g (CI, 0.1 to 1.0 g; P = 0.011). Mean trans plus saturated fat content decreased by 1.9 g overall (CI, -2.5 to -1.2 g; P < 0.001). Mean trans fat per 1000 kcal decreased by 2.7 g per 1000 kcal (CI, -3.1 to -2.3 g per 1000 kcal; P < 0.001). Purchases with zero grams of trans fat increased from 32% to 59%. In a multivariate analysis, the poverty rate of the neighborhood in which the restaurant was located was not associated with changes. LIMITATION: Fast-food restaurants that were included may not be representative of all NYC restaurants. CONCLUSION: The introduction of a local restaurant regulation was associated with a substantial and statistically significant decrease in the trans fat content of purchases at fast-food chains, without a commensurate increase in saturated fat. Restaurant patrons from high- and low-poverty neighborhoods benefited equally. However, federal regulation will be necessary to fully eliminate population exposure to industrial trans fat sources.

22801888,Racial disparities in the use of voice preservation therapy for locally advanced laryngeal cancer.,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Hou WH and Daly ME and Lee NY and Farwell DG and Luu Q and Chen AM,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To identify potential racial disparities in the use of larynx preservation. DESIGN: Retrospective database review. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify white, black, Hispanic, and Asian patients with stage III and IV laryngeal cancers that were diagnosed during 1991 through 2008. Patients with T4 disease or distant metastasis were intentionally excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, was used to investigate the relationship between race/ethnicity and the use of larynx preservation with radiation therapy as initial therapy. RESULTS: Among the 5385 cases of laryngeal cancers that met the selection criteria, the racial distribution was white (72.7%), black (16.8%), Hispanic (7.4%), and Asian (3.1%). On univariate analysis, blacks (odds ratio [OR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59-0.88) were significantly less likely to undergo larynx preservation. This racial disparity persisted on multivariate analysis for blacks (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63-0.96) and was still observed among patients treated more recently between 2001 and 2008 (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56-0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Pronounced racial disparities exist in the use of larynx preservation therapy for locally advanced laryngeal cancer. While acknowledging the potential biases of socioeconomic factors, further research to better elucidate the underlying reasons for these findings may be warranted.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Child Continental Population Groups/*statistics & numerical data Female Healthcare Disparities/*statistics & numerical data Humans Laryngeal Neoplasms/*ethnology/pathology/*radiotherapy Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Neoplasm Staging Retrospective Studies SEER Program United States/ethnology Vocal Cord Paralysis/prevention & control Voice Quality"

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the rate of UI in a sample of young nulligravid women and its potential risk factors and effect on quality of life. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire-based study. SETTING: University campuses and medical and allied health clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Nulligravid Australian women aged 16 to 30 years. MEASUREMENTS: The Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis, the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI), the King's Health Questionnaire, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. Demographic variables and potential risk factors were also documented. RESULTS: 1018 of 1620 questionnaires (63%) were returned, and 1002 provided analyzable data. The mean age of participants was 22.5 years (SD, 3.2). The rate of any UI was 12.6% (95% CI, 10.5% to 14.7%). Incontinence was slightly more common in students than in nonstudents (13.2% [CI, 11.0% to 15.8%] vs. 10.6% [CI, 6.7% to 14.6%]). Rates of UI varied according to sexual activity and use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs), with highest rates reported by students who were ever sexually active and not using COCs (21.5% [CI, 16.7% to 27.3%]). Women with UI reported significantly lower overall well-being than women without UI and had worse PGWBI scores related to anxiety, depression, positive well-being, and self-control. LIMITATION: A convenience sample of healthy, well-educated women was recruited, and response rates and participant characteristics varied by setting. CONCLUSION: In a sample of young nulligravid women, UI was associated with ever being sexually active and no COC use, as well as lower psychological well-being. Further research is needed to assess the prevalence and risk factors for UI in nulligravid women.

22776926,Risk for retinal detachment after phacoemulsification: a whole-population study of cataract surgery outcomes.,Arch Ophthalmol,Clark A and Morlet N and Ng JQ and Preen DB and Semmens JB,curtin,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the long-term cumulative incidence of and risk factors for retinal detachment (RD) after phacoemulsification using linked administrative medical data. METHODS: We used the Western Australian Data Linkage System to identify patients who underwent phacoemulsification in Western Australia between January 1989 and December 2001. Retinal detachment cases were those patients requiring admission for RD surgery after phacoemulsification that were validated by medical record review. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate a cumulative incidence. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to determine the association between RD and risk factors, including patient demographics and operative and hospital factors. Some important risk factors, including axial length and Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy, were not examined. RESULTS: We identified 237 RD cases following 65 055 phacoemulsification procedures, with a 10-year cumulative incidence of 0.68% (95% CI, 0.56%-0.83%). Significant risk factors were year of surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.28-0.66 [1999-2001 compared with 1989-1993] for each 5-year period after 1985), age younger than 60 years (3.76; 2.83-5.00), male sex (1.91; 1.45-2.51), and anterior vitrectomy (27.60; 19.27-39.52). Hospital location, patient rural or remote locality, hospital cataract surgery volume, failed intraocular lens insertion, length of stay, and patient insurance status were not significantly associated with RD. CONCLUSIONS: Risk for RD after phacoemulsification has almost halved for each 5-year period since its adoption in the mid 1980s. Younger patient age and male sex at surgery significantly increased risk for RD. Phacoemulsification requiring anterior vitrectomy vastly increased risk for RD.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Data Collection Databases, Factual Female Humans Incidence Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged *Phacoemulsification *Postoperative Complications Proportional Hazards Models Retinal Detachment/*epidemiology/etiology Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Treatment Outcome Western Australia/epidemiology Young Adult"

METHODS: Community-recruited adults aged 50 years and older were randomized to 1 of 3 study groups: 8-week training in mindfulness meditation, matched 8-week training in moderate-intensity sustained exercise, or observational control. The primary outcome was area-under-the-curve global illness severity during a single cold and influenza season, using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24) to assess severity. Health care visits and days of missed work were counted. Nasal wash collected during ARI illness was assayed for neutrophils, interleukin-8, and viral nucleic acid. RESULTS: Of 154 adults randomized into the study, 149 completed the trial (82% female, 94% white, mean age 59.3 +/- 6.6 years). There were 27 ARI episodes and 257 days of ARI illness in the meditation group (n = 51), 26 episodes and 241 illness days in the exercise group (n = 47), and 40 episodes and 453 days in the control group (n = 51). Mean global severity was 144 for meditation, 248 for exercise, and 358 for control. Compared with control, global severity was significantly lower for meditation (P = .004). Both global severity and total days of illness (duration) trended toward being lower for the exercise group (P=.16 and P=.032, respectively), as did illness duration for the meditation group (P=.034). Adjusting for covariates using zero-inflated multivariate regression models gave similar results. There were 67 ARI-related days of-work missed in the control group, 32 in the exercise group (P = .041), and 16 in the meditation group (P <.001). Health care visits did not differ significantly. Viruses were identified in 54% of samples from meditation, 42% from exercise, and 54% from control groups. Neutrophil count and interleukin-8 levels were similar among intervention groups.

22815989,Randomized Polypill crossover trial in people aged 50 and over.,PLoS One,Wald DS and Morris JK and Wald NJ,Missing,"BACKGROUND: A Polypill is proposed for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people judged to be at risk on account of their age alone. Its efficacy in reducing cholesterol and blood pressure is uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial of a Polypill among individuals aged 50+ without a history of cardiovascular disease and compared the reductions with those predicted from published estimates of the effects of the individual drugs. Participants took the Polypill (amlodipine 2.5 mg, losartan 25 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and simvastatin 40 mg) each evening for 12 weeks and a placebo each evening for 12 weeks in random sequence. The mean within-person differences in blood pressure and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol at the end of each 12 week period were determined. RESULTS: 84 out of 86 participants completed both treatment periods. The mean systolic blood pressure was reduced by 17.9 mmHg (95% CI, 15.7-20.1) on the Polypill, diastolic blood pressure by 9.8 mmHg (8.1-11.5), and LDL cholesterol by 1.4 mmol/L (1.2-1.6), reductions of 12%, 11%, and 39% respectively. The results were almost identical to those predicted; 18.4 mmHg, 9.7 mmHg, and 1.4 mmol/L respectively. CONCLUSION: The Polypill resulted in the predicted reductions in blood pressure and LDL cholesterol. Long term reductions of this magnitude would have a substantial effect in preventing heart attacks and strokes.

OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a hypocaloric, almond-enriched diet (AED) compared with a hypocaloric nut-free diet (NFD) on body weight and cardiovascular disease risk factors in the context of an 18-mo behavioral weight-management program. DESIGN: Overweight and obese individuals [n = 123; age = 46.8 y, BMI (in kg/m(2)) = 34.0] were randomly assigned to consume an AED or NFD and instructed in traditional behavioral methods of weight control. Anthropometric and metabolic measurements were made at baseline, 6 mo, and 18 mo. RESULTS: Those in the AED group lost slightly but significantly less weight than did those in the NFD group at 6 mo (-5.5 compared with -7.4 kg; P = 0.04), but there were no differences at 18 mo. No significant differences in body composition were found between the groups at 6 or 18 mo. The AED, compared with the NFD, was associated with greater reductions in total cholesterol (P = 0.03), total:HDL cholesterol (P = 0.02), and triglycerides (P = 0.048) at 6 mo, and no differences were observed between the groups at 18 mo. CONCLUSIONS: The AED and NFD groups experienced clinically significant and comparable weight loss at 18 mo.

DESIGN: Analysis of data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between January 2002 and December 2008. Unadjusted and risk-adjusted generalized linear regression models were used. SETTING: Academic research. PATIENTS: Data on patients undergoing urgent surgery for acute diverticulitis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of Hartmann procedure vs primary anastomosis, complications, length of hospital stay, and total hospital charges. RESULTS: In total, 31 832 patients were included; 7066 (22.2%) were admitted on weekends, and 24 766 (77.8%) were admitted on weekdays. The mean (SD) age of patients was 60.8 (15.3) years, and 16 830 (52.9%) were female. A Hartmann procedure was performed in 4580 patients (64.8%) admitted on weekends compared with 13 351 patients (53.9%) admitted on weekdays (risk-adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.57; P < .001). In risk-adjusted analyses, patients admitted on weekends had significantly higher risk for any postoperative complication (OR, 1.10; P = .005) and nonroutine hospital discharge (OR, 1.33; P < .001) compared with patients admitted on weekdays, as well as a median length of hospital stay that was 0.5 days longer and median total hospital charges that were $3734 higher (P < .001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing urgent surgery for left-sided diverticulitis who are admitted on a weekend have a higher risk for undergoing a Hartmann procedure and worse short-term outcomes compared with patients who are admitted on a weekday.

22802313,The price we pay for progress: a meta-analysis of harms of newly approved anticancer drugs.,J Clin Oncol,Niraula S and Seruga B and Ocana A and Shao T and Goldstein R and Tannock IF and Amir E,Missing,"PURPOSE: Registration of new anticancer drugs is usually based on results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing improved efficacy when compared with standard therapy. There is relatively less emphasis on toxicity. In our study, we analyze serious toxicities of newly approved anticancer drugs reported in pivotal RCTs used for drug registration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified RCTs evaluating agents for the treatment of solid tumors approved by the US Food and Drug Administration between 2000 and 2010. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI were computed for three end points of safety and tolerability: treatment-related death, treatment-discontinuation related to toxicity, and grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs). These were then pooled in a meta-analysis. Correlations between these end points and the hazard ratios for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were also assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-eight RCTs were analyzed. Compared with control groups, the odds of toxic death was greater for new agents (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.70; P < .001) as were the odds of treatment-discontinuation (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.45, P < .001). Grade 3 or 4 AEs (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.35 to 1. 71; P < .001) were also more common with new agents, especially nonhematologic AEs such as diarrhea, skin reactions, and neuropathy. There were no significant correlations between safety end points and OS or PFS. CONCLUSION: New anticancer agents that lead to improvements in time-to-event end points also increase morbidity and treatment-related mortality. The balance between efficacy and toxicity may be less favorable in clinical practice because of selection of fewer patients with good performance status and limited comorbidities. Patients' baseline health characteristics should be considered when choosing therapy.","Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects *Drug Approval Drugs, Investigational/*adverse effects Female Humans Male Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*mortality *Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Withholding Treatment"

However, there is little information on the nutrient content of chain restaurant menu items and changes over time. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the energy, saturated fat, and sodium content of entrees 6 and 18 months post-implementation of restaurant menu labeling in King County of Washington State for items that were on the menu at both time periods, and across all items at 6 and 18 months and to compare energy content to recommendations provided by the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. SETTING: Eligible restaurants included sit-down and quick-service chains (eg, burgers, pizza, sandwiches/subs, and Tex-Mex) subject to King County regulations with four or more establishments. One establishment per chain was audited at each time period. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Hypothesis one examined entrees that were on the menu at both time periods using a paired t test and hypothesis two compared quartiles at 6 months to the distribution at 18 months using a Mantel-Haentzel odds ratios and 95% CIs, and a Cochrane-Armitage test for trend. The content of entrees at 18 months was compared with one-third (assuming three meals per day) of the nutrient intake recommendations for adults provided by the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. RESULTS: The audit included 37 eligible chains of 92 regulated chains. Energy contents were lower (all chains -41, sit down -73, and quick service -19; paired t tests P<0.0001) for entrees that were on the menu at both time periods. There was a significant trend across quartiles for a decrease in energy, saturated fat, and sodium for all entrees at sit-down chains only. At 18 months entrees not designated for children exceeded 56%, 77%, and 89% of the energy, saturated fat, and sodium guidelines, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Modest improvements in the nutrient content of sit-down and quick-service restaurant entrees occurred but overall levels for energy, saturated fat, and sodium are excessive.","Dietary Fats/administration & dosage/*analysis *Energy Intake Food Analysis/standards *Food Labeling/standards/statistics & numerical data Guideline Adherence Humans Menu Planning/*standards Nutrition Policy Nutritive Value Restaurants/legislation & jurisprudence/standards/*statistics & numerical data Sodium, Dietary/administration & dosage/*analysis Time Factors Washington"
22669720,The association between time spent outdoors and myopia using a novel biomarker of outdoor light exposure.,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Sherwin JC and Hewitt AW and Coroneo MT and Kearns LS and Griffiths LR and Mackey DA,Missing,"PURPOSE: We sought to determine whether conjunctival ultraviolet autofluorescence (UVAF), a biomarker of outdoor light exposure, is associated with myopia. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study on Norfolk Island and recruited individuals aged >/= 15 years. Participants completed a sun-exposure questionnaire and underwent non-cycloplegic autorefraction. Conjunctival UVAF used a specially adapted electronic flash system fitted with UV-transmission filters (transmittance range 300-400 nm, peak 365 nm) as the excitation source. Temporal and nasal conjunctival UVAF was measured in both eyes using computerized photographic analysis with the sum referred to as ""total UVAF."" RESULTS: In 636 participants, prevalence of myopia decreased with an increasing quartile of total UVAF (P(trend) = 0.002). Median total UVAF was lower in subjects with myopia (spherical equivalent [SE] </= -1.0 diopter [D]) than participants without myopia: 16.6 mm(2) versus 28.6 mm(2), P = 0.001. In the multivariable model that adjusted for age, sex, smoking, cataract, height and weight, UVAF was independently associated with myopia (SE </= -1.0 D): odds ratio (OR) for total UVAF (per 10 mm(2)) was 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.94, P = 0.007. UVAF was also significantly associated with myopia when analysis was restricted to subjects <50 years, and in moderate-severe myopia (SE </= -3.0 D). Prevalence of myopia decreased with increasing time outdoors (P(trend) = 0.03), but time outdoors was not associated with myopia on multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Study authors identified a protective association between increasing UVAF and myopia. The protective association of higher UVAF against myopia was stronger than that of increased levels of time spent outdoors as measured by this study's questionnaire. Future studies should investigate the association between UVAF and incident myopia, and its relationship to myopic progression.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biological Markers Conjunctiva/*radiation effects Cross-Sectional Studies *Environmental Exposure Female Fluorescence Humans Leisure Activities Male Melanesia/epidemiology Middle Aged Myopia/*epidemiology/prevention & control Prevalence Questionnaires *Sunlight Time Factors *Ultraviolet Rays Young Adult"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study with 735 patients identified in the Regional Breast Cancer Quality Register of Central Sweden. The study sample consisted of 505 women (age < 63 years at diagnosis) who completed questionnaires at baseline and at follow-up (on average 4 and 16 months after diagnosis, respectively). Clinical register data and questionnaire data on sociodemographic factors were obtained at baseline. Self-reported work-related data were obtained at follow-up. Odds ratios were estimated by using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Compared with prediagnosis working time, 72% reported no change in working time, 2% reported an increase, 15% reported a decrease, and 11% did not work at follow-up. Chemotherapy increased the likelihood (odds ratio [OR], 2.45; 95% CI, 1.38 to 4.34) of job discontinuation/decreased working time. Among chemotherapy recipients, associated factors included full-time work prediagnosis (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.51 to 7.01), cancer-related work limitations (OR, 5.26; 95% CI, 2.30 to 12.03), and less value attached to work (OR, 3.69; 95% CI, 1.80 to 7.54). In the nonchemotherapy group, older age (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.17) and less value attached to work (OR, 5.00; 95% CI, 2.01 to 12.45) were associated with the outcome. CONCLUSION: The majority of women treated for breast cancer returned to their prediagnosis working time.

OBJECTIVE: To provide current recommendations for the treatment of adult HIV infection with ART and use of laboratory-monitoring tools. Guidelines include when to start therapy and with what drugs, monitoring for response and toxic effects, special considerations in therapy, and managing antiretroviral failure. DATA SOURCES, STUDY SELECTION, AND DATA EXTRACTION: Data that had been published or presented in abstract form at scientific conferences in the past 2 years were systematically searched and reviewed by an International Antiviral Society-USA panel. The panel reviewed available evidence and formed recommendations by full panel consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: Treatment is recommended for all adults with HIV infection; the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence increase with decreasing CD4 cell count and the presence of certain concurrent conditions. Recommended initial regimens include 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine) plus a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (efavirenz), a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (atazanavir or darunavir), or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (raltegravir). Alternatives in each class are recommended for patients with or at risk of certain concurrent conditions. CD4 cell count and HIV-1 RNA level should be monitored, as should engagement in care, ART adherence, HIV drug resistance, and quality-of-care indicators. Reasons for regimen switching include virologic, immunologic, or clinical failure and drug toxicity or intolerance. Confirmed treatment failure should be addressed promptly and multiple factors considered. CONCLUSION: New recommendations for HIV patient care include offering ART to all patients regardless of CD4 cell count, changes in therapeutic options, and modifications in the timing and choice of ART in the setting of opportunistic illnesses such as cryptococcal disease and tuberculosis.","AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections Adult Anti-Retroviral Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects CD4 Lymphocyte Count Drug Administration Schedule Drug Therapy, Combination Female HIV Infections/complications/*drug therapy Hepatitis B/complications Hepatitis C/complications Humans Male Medication Adherence Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/drug therapy Quality of Health Care RNA, Viral/blood Societies, Medical Treatment Failure"
22820642,Silencing of Irf7 pathways in breast cancer cells promotes bone metastasis through immune escape.,Nat Med,Bidwell BN and Slaney CY and Withana NP and Forster S and Cao Y and Loi S and Andrews D and Mikeska T and Mangan NE and Samarajiwa SA and de Weerd NA and Gould J and Argani P and Moller A and Smyth MJ and Anderson RL and Hertzog PJ and Parker BS,Missing,"Breast cancer metastasis is a key determinant of long-term patient survival. By comparing the transcriptomes of primary and metastatic tumor cells in a mouse model of spontaneous bone metastasis, we found that a substantial number of genes suppressed in bone metastases are targets of the interferon regulatory factor Irf7. Restoration of Irf7 in tumor cells or administration of interferon led to reduced bone metastases and prolonged survival time. In mice deficient in the interferon (IFN) receptor or in natural killer (NK) and CD8(+) T cell responses, metastasis was accelerated, indicating that Irf7-driven suppression of metastasis was reliant on IFN signaling to host immune cells. We confirmed the clinical relevance of these findings in over 800 patients in which high expression of Irf7-regulated genes in primary tumors was associated with prolonged bone metastasis-free survival. This gene signature may identify patients that could benefit from IFN-based therapies. Thus, we have identified an innate immune pathway intrinsic to breast cancer cells, the suppression of which restricts immunosurveillance to enable metastasis.","Animals Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology Female Gene Expression Profiling *Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects *Gene Silencing Humans Immunologic Surveillance Interferon Regulatory Factor-7/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology Interferon-alpha/pharmacology Killer Cells, Natural/immunology Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*immunology Mice Mice, Inbred BALB C Mice, Inbred NOD Mice, SCID Neoplasm Metastasis/physiopathology Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology Receptors, Interferon/deficiency/physiology Recombinant Proteins/metabolism Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/genetics/immunology T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology Tumor Escape/genetics/*physiology"

This first-in-human, single and multiple ascending dose study in 70 healthy male volunteers determined the maximum oral dose of KAF156 tolerated by healthy adults, and derived pharmacokinetic data (including preliminary food effect) to enable dose calculations for malaria patients. KAF156 was studied in single dose cohorts (10-1200 mg, including one 400 mg food effect cohort; (4-10 subjects/cohort); and in multiple dose cohorts (60-600 mg once daily for 3 days; 8 subjects/cohort). The follow-up period was 6-14 days post last dose. KAF156 was tolerated, with self-limited mild to moderate gastrointestinal and neurological adverse events. In treated subjects after single doses, headache (N=4, 11.1%), diarrhea (N=3, 8.3%), dizziness (N=3, 8.3%) and abdominal pain (N=2, 5.6%) were the commonest adverse events. Headache (N=4, 16.7%), nausea (N=3, 12.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (N=3, 12.5%), and dizziness (N=2, 8.3%) were the commonest adverse events following multiple doses.

We investigated new multiple-agent combinations over the first 14 days of treatment to assess their suitability for future development. METHODS: In this prospective, randomised, early bactericidal activity (EBA) study, treatment-naive, drug-susceptible patients with uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis were admitted to hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa, between Oct 7, 2010, and Aug 19, 2011. Patients were randomised centrally by computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive bedaquiline, bedaquiline-pyrazinamide, PA-824-pyrazinamide, bedaquiline-PA-824, PA-824-moxifloxacin-pyrazinamide, or unmasked standard antituberculosis treatment as positive control. The primary outcome was the 14-day EBA assessed in a central laboratory from the daily fall in colony forming units (CFU) of M tuberculosis per mL of sputum in daily overnight sputum collections. Bilinear regression curves were fitted for each group separately and groups compared with ANOVA for ranks, followed by pair-wise comparisons adjusted for multiplicity. Clinical staff were partially masked but laboratory personnel were fully masked. This study is registered, NCT01215851. FINDINGS: The mean 14-day EBA of PA-824-moxifloxacin-pyrazinamide (n=13; 0.233 [SD 0.128]) was significantly higher than that of bedaquiline (14; 0.061 [0.068]), bedaquiline-pyrazinamide (15; 0.131 [0.102]), bedaquiline-PA-824 (14; 0.114 [0.050]), but not PA-824-pyrazinamide (14; 0.154 [0.040]), and comparable with that of standard treatment (ten; 0.140 [0.094]). Treatments were well tolerated and appeared safe. One patient on PA-824-moxifloxacin-pyrazinamide was withdrawn because of corrected QT interval changes exceeding criteria prespecified in the protocol. INTERPRETATION: PA-824-moxifloxacin-pyrazinamide is potentially suitable for treating drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

We aimed to assess risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) according to time since polypectomy and factors that might be relevant for risk stratification. METHODS: In a population-based case-control study conducted in Germany, detailed history and results of previous large-bowel endoscopies were obtained by interview and from medical records. Risk of CRC among participants with detection of at least one adenoma at a preceding colonoscopy compared with participants without previous large-bowel endoscopy was assessed according to time since polypectomy among 2,582 cases with CRC and 1,798 matched controls. RESULTS: Adjusted odds ratios (95% CIs) of CRC for participants with polypectomy less than 3, 3 to 5, and 6 to 10 years ago (using participants without previous endoscopy as reference group) were 0.2 (0.2 to 0.3), 0.4 (0.3 to 0.6), and 0.9 (0.5 to 1.5), respectively. Strong, significant risk reduction within 5 years was consistently seen for women and men, younger and older participants, patients with and without high-risk polyps (three or more polyps, at least one polyp >/= 1 cm, at least one polyp with villous components), and those with and without polypectomy in the right colon. With adjusted odds ratios of 0.1 (0.1 to 0.2), 0.3 (0.2 to 0.5) and 0.4 (0.2 to 0.8) for patients with polypectomy less than 3, 3 to 5, and 6 to 10 years ago, risk reduction was particularly strong for left-sided CRC. CONCLUSION: Extension of surveillance intervals to 5 years should be considered, even after detection and removal of high-risk polyps.","Adenomatous Polyps/*complications/*surgery Aged Aged, 80 and over Case-Control Studies Colonic Polyps/*surgery Colonoscopy Colorectal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Population Surveillance Risk Assessment Time Factors Watchful Waiting"

The introduction of HPV vaccines necessitates the estimation of the population-based incidence of GW immediately before and after vaccination uptake. METHODS: Incidence proportions were calculated using the entire population aged 10-44 years living in Sweden during 2006-2010. The Prescribed Drug Register and the National Patient Register were used to define GW episodes. Time trends were estimated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: In 2010, age-stratified incidence proportions of GW were highest for 20-year-old women (956 cases/100 000), while the incidence proportion among males was greatest at the slightly older age of 24 years (1137 cases/100 000). Crude rates were marginally higher among males than among females during 2006-2007 and appeared to later diverge. Between 2008 and 2010, the overall incidence appeared to increase among males, and the incidence among females declined. Females aged 17 and 18 years had a >25% decline in GW rates between 2006 and 2010, with significant decreases through the age of 25 years. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a reasonable estimation of the incidence of GW in the Swedish population by use of register data, with results comparable to those from previous smaller studies.

22752512,Seasonality and temporal correlation between community antibiotic use and resistance in the United States.,Clin Infect Dis,Sun L and Klein EY and Laxminarayan R,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic antibiotic use in humans is a significant driver of antibiotic resistance. The seasonal effect of antibiotic use on antibiotic resistance has been poorly quantified because of lack of large-scale, spatially disaggregated time-series data on antibiotic use and resistance. METHODS: We used time-series analysis (Box-Jenkins) on US antibiotic usage from IMS Health and on antibiotic resistance from The Surveillance Network from 1999-2007 to estimate the effect of aminopenicillin, fluoroquinolone, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline usage on resistance of Escherichia coli to drugs within these classes. We also quantified the effect of fluoroquinolone and macrolide/lincosamide usage on resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to ciprofloxacin and clindamycin (which has a similar mode of action to macrolides), respectively. RESULTS: Prevalence of resistant Escherichia coli was significantly correlated with lagged (by 1 month) antibiotic prescriptions for aminopenicillins (0.22, P = .03) and fluoroquinolones (0.24, P = .02), which are highly prescribed, but was uncorrelated to antibiotic classes with lower prescription levels. Fluoroquinolone prescriptions were also significantly correlated with a 1-month lag with the prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA (0.23, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Large-scale usage of antibiotics can generate seasonal patterns of resistance that fluctuate on a short time scale with changes in antibiotic retail sales, suggesting that use of antibiotics in the winter could have a significant effect on resistance. In addition, the strong correlation between community use of antibiotics and resistance isolated in the hospital indicates that restrictions imposed at the hospital level are unlikely to be effective unless coordinated with campaigns to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use at the community level.","Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy/*epidemiology Databases, Factual *Drug Resistance, Bacterial Escherichia coli/drug effects Humans Prevalence Retrospective Studies Seasons Staphylococcus aureus/drug effects United States"

Our objective was to provide a summary estimate of adherence to drugs that prevent coronary heart disease, according to drug class and use in people who have had a myocardial infarction (secondary prevention) and people who have not (primary prevention). METHODS: A meta-analysis of data on 376,162 patients from 20 studies assessing adherence using prescription refill frequency for the following 7 drug classes was performed: aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, thiazides, and statins. Meta-regression was used to examine the effects of age, payment, and treatment duration. RESULTS: The summary estimate for adherence across all studies was 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50-64) after a median of 24 months. There were statistically significant differences in adherence between primary and secondary prevention: 50% (CI, 45-56) and 66% (CI, 56-75), respectively (P=.012). Adherence was lower for thiazides (42%) than for angiotensin receptor blockers (61%) in primary prevention (P=.02). There were no other statistically significant differences between any of the drug classes in primary or secondary prevention studies. Adherence decreased by 0.15% points/month (P=.07) and was unrelated to age or whether patients paid for their pills. CONCLUSION: Adherence to preventive treatment is poor and little related to class of drug, suggesting that side effects are not the main cause.

Dietary GI and GL were calculated from country-specific dietary questionnaires. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to quantify the association between GI, GL, and carbohydrate intake and BC risk. BC tumors were classified by receptor status. RESULTS: Overall GI, GL, and carbohydrates were not related to BC. Among postmenopausal women, GL and carbohydate intake were significantly associated with an increased risk of estrogen receptor-negative (ER(-)) BC when extreme quintiles (Q) were compared [multivariable HR(Q5-Q1) (95% CI) = 1.36 (1.02, 1.82; P-trend = 0.010) and HR(Q5-Q1) = 1.41 (1.05, 1.89; P-trend = 0.009), respectively]. Further stratification by progesterone receptor (PR) status showed slightly stronger associations with ER(-)/PR(-) BC [HR(Q5-Q1) (95% CI) = 1.48 (1.07, 2.05; P-trend = 0.010) for GL and HR(Q5-Q1) = 1.62 (1.15, 2.30; P-trend = 0.005) for carbohydrates]. No significant association with ER-positive BC was observed. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that a diet with a high GL and carbohydrate intake is positively associated with an increased risk of developing ER(-) and ER(-)/PR(-) BC among postmenopausal women.","Adult Aged Blood Glucose/*analysis Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*physiopathology *Diet Dietary Carbohydrates/administration & dosage European Continental Ancestry Group Female Follow-Up Studies *Glycemic Index Humans Insulin/blood Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism Middle Aged Nutrition Assessment Nutritional Status Postmenopause Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Questionnaires Receptors, Estrogen/analysis Risk Factors Treatment Outcome"
22773702,Curcumin extract for prevention of type 2 diabetes.,Diabetes Care,Chuengsamarn S and Rattanamongkolgul S and Luechapudiporn R and Phisalaphong C and Jirawatnotai S,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of curcumin in delaying development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the prediabetic population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded, placebo- controlled trial included subjects (n = 240) with criteria of prediabetes. All subjects were randomly assigned to receive either curcumin or placebo capsules for 9 months. To assess the T2DM progression after curcumin treatments and to determine the number of subjects progressing to T2DM, changes in beta-cell functions (homeostasis model assessment [HOMA]-beta, C-peptide, and proinsulin/insulin), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), anti-inflammatory cytokine (adiponectin), and other parameters were monitored at the baseline and at 3-, 6-, and 9-month visits during the course of intervention. RESULTS: After 9 months of treatment, 16.4% of subjects in the placebo group were diagnosed with T2DM, whereas none were diagnosed with T2DM in the curcumin-treated group. In addition, the curcumin-treated group showed a better overall function of beta-cells, with higher HOMA-beta (61.58 vs. 48.72; P < 0.01) and lower C-peptide (1.7 vs. 2.17; P < 0.05). The curcumin-treated group showed a lower level of HOMA-IR (3.22 vs. 4.04; P < 0.001) and higher adiponectin (22.46 vs. 18.45; P < 0.05) when compared with the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: A 9-month curcumin intervention in a prediabetic population significantly lowered the number of prediabetic individuals who eventually developed T2DM. In addition, the curcumin treatment appeared to improve overall function of beta-cells, with very minor adverse effects. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the curcumin intervention in a prediabetic population may be beneficial.","Curcumin/*therapeutic use Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*prevention & control Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Middle Aged Plant Extracts/*therapeutic use Prediabetic State/*drug therapy Treatment Outcome"
22777340,A prospective study of cigarette smoking and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease in women.,Am J Gastroenterol,Higuchi LM and Khalili H and Chan AT and Richter JM and Bousvaros A and Fuchs CS,harvard,"OBJECTIVES: Long-term data on the influence of cigarette smoking, especially cessation, on the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 229,111 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II). Biennially, we collected updated data on cigarette smoking, other risk factors, and diagnoses of CD or UC confirmed by medical record review. RESULTS: Over 32 years in NHS and 18 years in NHS II, we documented 336 incident cases of CD and 400 incident cases of UC. Compared with never smokers, the multivariate hazard ratio (HR) of CD was 1.90 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.42-2.53) among current smokers and 1.35 (95% CI, 1.05-1.73) among former smokers. Increasing pack-years was associated with increasing risk of CD (Ptrend < 0.0001), whereas smoking cessation was associated with an attenuation of risk. By contrast, the multivariate HR of UC was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.61-1.20) among current smokers and 1.56 (95% CI, 1.26-1.93) among former smokers. The risk of UC was significantly increased within 2-5 years of smoking cessation (HR, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.00-4.67) and remained persistently elevated over 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking is associated with an increased risk of CD, but not UC. By contrast, former smoking is associated with an increased risk of UC, with risk persisting over two decades after cessation.","Adult Colitis, Ulcerative/*epidemiology/etiology Crohn Disease/*epidemiology/etiology Female Health Surveys Humans Incidence Longitudinal Studies Middle Aged Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Smoking/*adverse effects Smoking Cessation Women"
22771185,Fermentable fibers do not affect satiety or food intake by women who do not practice restrained eating.,J Acad Nutr Diet,Karalus M and Clark M and Greaves KA and Thomas W and Vickers Z and Kuyama M and Slavin J,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Fiber is thought to enhance satiety, although not all fibers are equally effective. Colonic fermentation may influence satiety and food intake. OBJECTIVE: To test the satiating properties of four isolated fibers added to chocolate crisp bars. DESIGN: Within-subject preload design with repeated measures. Each participant completed five conditions, presented in random order. SUBJECTS: Participants were 22 adult women who do not practice restrained eating (body mass index 18 to 29). INTERVENTION: The experimental conditions were four fiber treatments: 10 g oligofructose, inulin, soluble corn fiber, or resistant wheat starch in chocolate crisp bars. A no-added-fiber bar was evaluated as the control. The night before each treatment, participants consumed a dinner bar containing 10 g of the same fiber given the next morning. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Repeated ratings of feelings related to hunger and fullness at the lunch meal were the main measures. Secondary outcomes included breath hydrogen and methane, gastrointestinal symptoms, energy consumed at an ad libitum lunch, and energy from 24-hour dietary recall. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Mixed-effect linear models with random intercept for participants to model within-subject correlation. RESULTS: All treatments were well tolerated. No differences were found in subjective satiety during the morning or food intake at lunch or over 24 hours. The oligofructose bar produced the greatest increase in breath hydrogen, and the most bloating and flatulence symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Functional fibers incorporated into chocolate bars at high fiber doses produce greater gastrointestinal symptoms than control, but do not alter satiety, hunger, or food intake compared with control in the short term.",Adolescent Adult Breath Tests Dietary Fiber/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/metabolism Energy Intake/*drug effects Female *Fermentation Flatulence/*epidemiology/etiology Humans Hydrogen/analysis Inulin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/metabolism Linear Models Obesity/prevention & control Oligosaccharides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/metabolism Satiation/*drug effects Time Factors Triticum/adverse effects/metabolism Young Adult Zea mays/adverse effects/metabolism
22734792,Contribution of individual diseases to death in older adults with multiple diseases.,J Am Geriatr Soc,Tinetti ME and McAvay GJ and Murphy TE and Gross CP and Lin H and Allore HG,yale,"OBJECTIVES: To determine empirically the diseases contributing most commonly and strongly to death in older adults, accounting for coexisting diseases. DESIGN: Longitudinal. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two thousand eight hundred ninety Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey participants, a national representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries, enrolled during 2002 to 2006. MEASUREMENTS: Information on chronic and acute diseases was ascertained from Medicare claims data. Diseases contributing to death during follow-up were identified empirically using regression models for all diseases with a frequency of 1% or greater and hazard ratio for death of greater than 1. The additive contributions of these diseases, adjusting for coexisting diseases, were calculated using a longitudinal extension of average attributable fraction; 95% confidence intervals were estimated from bootstrapping. RESULTS: Fifteen diseases and acute events contributed significantly to death, together accounting for nearly 70% of death. Heart failure (20.0%), dementia (13.6%), chronic lower respiratory disease (12.4%), and pneumonia (5.3%) made the largest contributions to death. Cancer, including lung, colorectal, lymphoma, and head and neck, together contributed to 5.6% of death. Other diseases and events included acute kidney injury, stroke, septicemia, liver disease, myocardial infarction, and unintentional injuries. CONCLUSION: The use of methods that focus on determining a single underlying cause may lead to underestimation of the extent of the contribution of some diseases such as dementia and respiratory disease to death in older adults and overestimation of the contribution of other diseases. Current conceptualization of a single underlying cause may not account adequately for the contribution to death of coexisting diseases that older adults experience.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cause of Death *Comorbidity Female *Geriatrics Humans Longitudinal Studies Male"
22828356,Excessive chest compression rate is associated with insufficient compression depth in prehospital cardiac arrest.,Resuscitation,Monsieurs KG and De Regge M and Vansteelandt K and De Smet J and Annaert E and Lemoyne S and Kalmar AF and Calle PA,Missing,"BACKGROUND AND GOAL OF STUDY: The relationship between chest compression rate and compression depth is unknown. In order to characterise this relationship, we performed an observational study in prehospital cardiac arrest patients. We hypothesised that faster compressions are associated with decreased depth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In patients undergoing prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation by health care professionals, chest compression rate and depth were recorded using an accelerometer (E-series monitor-defibrillator, Zoll, U.S.A.). Compression depth was compared for rates <80/min, 80-120/min and >120/min. A difference in compression depth >/=0.5 cm was considered clinically significant. Mixed models with repeated measurements of chest compression depth and rate (level 1) nested within patients (level 2) were used with compression rate as a continuous and as a categorical predictor of depth. Results are reported as means and standard error (SE). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: One hundred and thirty-three consecutive patients were analysed (213,409 compressions). Of all compressions 2% were <80/min, 62% between 80 and 120/min and 36% >120/min, 36% were <4 cm deep, 45% between 4 and 5 cm, 19% >5 cm. In 77 out of 133 (58%) patients a statistically significant lower depth was observed for rates >120/min compared to rates 80-120/min, in 40 out of 133 (30%) this difference was also clinically significant. The mixed models predicted that the deepest compression (4.5 cm) occurred at a rate of 86/min, with progressively lower compression depths at higher rates. Rates >145/min would result in a depth <4 cm. Predicted compression depth for rates 80-120/min was on average 4.5 cm (SE 0.06) compared to 4.1 cm (SE 0.06) for compressions >120/min (mean difference 0.4 cm, P<0.001). Age and sex of the patient had no additional effect on depth. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed an association between higher compression rates and lower compression depths. Avoiding excessive compression rates may lead to more compressions of sufficient depth.",Aged Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/*methods Female Heart Arrest/*therapy Humans Male Middle Aged
22836655,"The effects of circadian phase, time awake, and imposed sleep restriction on performing complex visual tasks: evidence from comparative visual search.",J Vis,Pomplun M and Silva EJ and Ronda JM and Cain SW and Munch MY and Czeisler CA and Duffy JF,umb,"Cognitive performance not only differs between individuals, but also varies within them, influenced by factors that include sleep-wakefulness and biological time of day (circadian phase). Previous studies have shown that both factors influence accuracy rather than the speed of performing a visual search task, which can be hazardous in safety-critical tasks such as air-traffic control or baggage screening. However, prior investigations used simple, brief search tasks requiring little use of working memory. In order to study the effects of circadian phase, time awake, and chronic sleep restriction on the more realistic scenario of longer tasks requiring the sustained interaction of visual working memory and attentional control, the present study employed two comparative visual search tasks. In these tasks, participants had to detect a mismatch between two otherwise identical object distributions, with one of the tasks (mirror task) requiring an additional mental image transformation. Time awake and circadian phase both had significant influences on the speed, but not the accuracy of task performance. Over the course of three weeks of chronic sleep restriction, speed but not accuracy of task performance was impacted. The results suggest measures for safer performance of important tasks and point out the importance of minimizing the impact of circadian phase and sleep-wake history in laboratory vision experiments.","Adult Attention/physiology Circadian Rhythm/*physiology Female Humans Male Memory, Short-Term/*physiology Mental Processes/physiology Photic Stimulation/methods Psychomotor Performance/*physiology Reaction Time/physiology Sleep Deprivation/*physiopathology Wakefulness/*physiology Young Adult"
22797291,The costs of critical care telemedicine programs: a systematic review and analysis.,Chest,Kumar G and Falk DM and Bonello RS and Kahn JM and Perencevich E and Cram P,uiowa,"BACKGROUND: Implementation of telemedicine programs in ICUs (tele-ICUs) may improve patient outcomes, but the costs of these programs are unknown. We performed a systematic literature review to summarize existing data on the costs of tele-ICUs and collected detailed data on the costs of implementing a tele-ICU in a network of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies published between January 1, 1990, and July 1, 2011, reporting costs of tele-ICUs. Studies were summarized, and key cost data were abstracted. We then obtained the costs of implementing a tele-ICU in a network of seven VHA hospitals and report these costs in light of the existing literature. RESULTS: Our systematic review identified eight studies reporting tele-ICU costs. These studies suggested combined implementation and first year of operation costs for a tele-ICU of $50,000 to $100,000 per monitored ICU-bed. Changes in patient care costs after tele-ICU implementation ranged from a $3,000 reduction to a $5,600 increase in hospital cost per patient. VHA data suggested a cost for implementation and first year of operation of $70,000 to $87,000 per ICU-bed, depending on the depreciation methods applied. CONCLUSIONS: The cost of tele-ICU implementation is substantial, and the impact of these programs on hospital costs or profits is unclear. Until additional data become available, clinicians and administrators should carefully weigh the clinical and economic aspects of tele-ICUs when considering investing in this technology.","Costs and Cost Analysis Critical Care/*economics Hospital Costs Hospitals, Veterans/economics Humans Intensive Care Units/economics Telemedicine/*economics"

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, BIOSIS, and Scopus. Studies were included if they involved: participants >/=18 years of age; patients with community-acquired pneumonia; current statin users; and reported overall or adjusted mortality after pneumonia. RESULTS: Of 491 citations identified, 13 studies involving 254,950 patients met eligibility criteria. Pooled unadjusted data showed that statin use was associated with lower mortality after pneumonia (odds ratio [OR] 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.71). Pooling of adjusted data also showed reduced mortality after pneumonia (OR 0.66, 95% CI, 0.55-0.79). However, this effect was attenuated in subgroup analysis by confounders and in prospective studies. CONCLUSIONS: Although statin use is associated with decreased mortality after pneumonia, this effect weakens in important subgroups.

DESIGN: A longitudinal prospective cohort study with follow-ups at 3 months, 1 year and 3 years. Treatment effects were derived by comparing groups at follow-up. IPTW estimators were used to adjust for pre-treatment differences between groups. SETTING: Sydney and Brisbane, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were methamphetamine users entering community-based detoxification (n = 112) or residential rehabilitation (n = 248) services and a quasi-control group of methamphetamine users (n = 101) recruited from the community. MEASUREMENTS: Frequency of methamphetamine use between interviews (no use, less than weekly, 1-2 days per week, 3+ days per week), continuous abstinence from methamphetamine use, past month methamphetamine use and methamphetamine dependence. FINDINGS: Detoxification did not reduce methamphetamine use at any follow-up relative to the quasi-control group. Relative to quasi-control and detoxification groups combined, residential rehabilitation produced large reductions in the frequency of methamphetamine use at 3 months [odds ratio (OR) = 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.36, P < 0.001), with a marked attenuation of this effect at 1 year (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40-0.97, P = 0.038) and 3 years (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.42-1.19, P = 0.189). The greatest impact was for abstinence: for every 100 residential rehabilitation clients there was a gain of 33 being continuously abstinent at 3 months, with this falling to 14 at 1 year and 6 at 3 years.

METHODS: Among participants (age >/=20 years) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys in 1988-1994 and 2007-2010, gout status was ascertained by self-report of a physician diagnosis. Body mass index (BMI) was examined in categories of <18.5 kg/m(2) , 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2) , 25-29.9 kg/m(2) , 30-34.9 kg/m(2) , and >/=35 kg/m(2) and as a continuous variable. The cross-sectional association of BMI category with gout status was adjusted for demographic and obesity-related medical disorders. RESULTS: In the US, the crude prevalence of gout was 1-2% among participants with a normal BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2) ), 3% among overweight participants, 4-5% with class I obesity, and 5-7% with class II or class III obesity. The adjusted prevalence ratio comparing the highest to a normal BMI category was 2.46 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.44-4.21) in 1988-1994 and 2.21 (95% CI 1.50-3.26) in 2007-2010. Notably, there was a progressively greater prevalence ratio of gout associated with successively higher categories of BMI. In both survey periods, for an average American adult standing 1.76 meters (5 feet 9 inches), a 1-unit higher BMI, corresponding to 3.1 kg (~6.8 pounds) greater weight, was associated with a 5% greater prevalence of gout, even after adjusting for serum uric acid (P < 0.001).

METHODS: Electronic databases and bibliographies of relevant references were searched, and a meta-analysis of identified trials was conducted. The variability in effect size and the impact of potential moderators (study design, duration of intervention, magnitude of reinforcement, and frequency of reinforcement) on effect size were examined. RESULTS: Fifteen randomized studies and 6 nonrandomized studies examined the efficacy of financial reinforcement interventions for medication adherence. Financial reinforcers were applied for adherence to medications for tuberculosis, substance abuse, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, schizophrenia, and stroke prevention. Reinforcement interventions significantly improved adherence relative to control conditions with an overall effect size of 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.84; P<.001). Nonrandomized studies had a larger average effect size than randomized studies, but the effect size of randomized studies remained significant at 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.53; P<.001). Interventions that were longer in duration, provided an average reinforcement of $50 or more per week, and reinforced patients at least weekly resulted in larger effect sizes than those that were shorter, provided lower reinforcers, and reinforced patients less frequently. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the efficacy of medication adherence interventions and underscore principles that should be considered in designing future adherence interventions.

BACKGROUND: Headache is the most common pain syndrome in middle-aged adults, and migraine is highly prevalent and severely disabling. Although the mechanisms of and the therapies for migraines have long been explored, less is known about the functional impairments associated with them, especially the impairment in time perception, that is, the ability to estimate the passage of time. METHODS: In this study, we used a temporal reproduction task to assess the estimation of the duration of visual stimulus in 27 migraine patients. The stimulus was delivered at different intervals over the milliseconds and seconds range. RESULTS: In the setting of an interstimulus interval for 1 second and an interstimulus interval for 5 seconds in the 600-millisecond-duration reproduction task, the migraineurs showed impairment in time perception, and in that they significantly overestimated the duration, as compared with the healthy subjects. When compared with the healthy controls for the 3-second and 5-second duration reproduction task, migraineurs in the setting of an interstimulus interval for 1 second and an interstimulus interval for 5 seconds did not show impairment in time perception.

Each virus also causes serious and commonly lethal infection of people as well as various species of domestic animals, however little is known about the associated mechanisms of pathogenesis. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a new paramyxovirus from pteropid bats, Cedar virus (CedPV), which shares significant features with the known henipaviruses. The genome size (18,162 nt) and organization of CedPV is very similar to that of HeV and NiV; its nucleocapsid protein displays antigenic cross-reactivity with henipaviruses; and it uses the same receptor molecule (ephrin-B2) for entry during infection. Preliminary challenge studies with CedPV in ferrets and guinea pigs, both susceptible to infection and disease with known henipaviruses, confirmed virus replication and production of neutralizing antibodies although clinical disease was not observed. In this context, it is interesting to note that the major genetic difference between CedPV and HeV or NiV lies within the coding strategy of the P gene, which is known to play an important role in evading the host innate immune system. Unlike HeV, NiV, and almost all known paramyxoviruses, the CedPV P gene lacks both RNA editing and also the coding capacity for the highly conserved V protein. Preliminary study indicated that CedPV infection of human cells induces a more robust IFN-beta response than HeV.","Animals Antibodies, Viral/blood/immunology Australia Chiroptera/immunology/*virology Ferrets Genome, Viral/*immunology Guinea Pigs *Henipavirus/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification *Henipavirus Infections/blood/genetics/immunology/virology Humans *Immune Evasion *Immunity, Innate"

The aim of this study was to address the frequency of injuries, especially rib and sternal fractures, and also to identify factors that contribute to post-CPR trauma. METHODS: This study was a prospective cross-sectional study conducted in the emergency departments (ED) of eight academic tertiary care centers. To evaluate injuries secondary to CPR, we performed chest computed tomography (CT) in patients who were successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Contributing factors that might be related to injuries were also investigated. RESULTS: We enrolled 71 patients between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2011. Rib and sternal fractures were diagnosed in 22 and 3 patients, respectively. Females were more susceptible to rib fracture (p=0.036). When non-physicians participated as chest compressors in the ED, more ribs were fractured (p=0.048). The duration of CPR and number of compressors were not contributing factors to trauma secondary to CPR. There was a wide variation in the frequency of rib fractures from hospital to hospital (0-83.3%). In high-risk hospitals (in which more than 50% of patients had rib fractures), the average age of the patients was higher, and non-physicians took part in ED CPR more often than they did at low-risk hospitals. CONCLUSION: The incidence of rib fracture following CPR was different in various hospitals. The presence of non-physician chest compressors in the ED was one of the contributing factors to rib fracture. Further studies on the influence of resuscitators and relation between quality of chest compression and CPR-induced injuries are warranted to reduce complications following CPR.","Aged Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/*adverse effects/methods Cross-Sectional Studies Female Heart Arrest/*therapy Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies Republic of Korea/epidemiology Rib Fractures/epidemiology/etiology/*radiography Sternum/*injuries/radiography Thoracic Injuries/epidemiology/etiology/*radiography Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods"

PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Data were from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey-Kindergarten Cohort 1998-1999 (ECLS-K), a nationally representative study of children followed from kindergarten through 8th grade. This analysis used data from Spring 2004 and 2007, when most children were in 5th and 8th grade, respectively (n=7,445). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures were changes in consumption of sweetened beverages, milk, and 100% fruit juice last week. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Survey-adjusted linear regression was used to estimate longitudinal relationships between servings of milk, sweetened beverages, and 100% fruit juice, controlling for child and family characteristics and food consumption. RESULTS: Children's milk consumption decreased between 5th and 8th grade, and these decreases were larger among children who drank sweetened beverages daily. However, after controlling for demographic characteristics, changes in children's milk consumption were not significantly related to changes in their consumption of sweetened beverages over time (beta=.005; P=0.81), while changes in milk consumption were positively related to changes in juice consumption (beta=.087; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Observed decreases in average milk consumption from 5th to 8th grade were not related to changes in sweetened-beverage consumption. They were positively related to changes in fruit juice consumption, so not indicating displacement. Caloric beverages generally tended to increase or decrease in tandem, so focus must be placed on their role in children's entire diet and on balancing them with food and total beverage intake.",Adolescent Animals Beverages/*statistics & numerical data Carbonated Beverages/*statistics & numerical data Child Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena Drinking Female Fruit Humans Linear Models Longitudinal Studies Male Milk/*statistics & numerical data Nutrition Surveys Nutritive Value Obesity/etiology/prevention & control Schools/*statistics & numerical data
22868691,A prospective study of weight training and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in men.,Arch Intern Med,Grontved A and Rimm EB and Willett WC and Andersen LB and Hu FB,Missing,"BACKGROUND The role of weight training in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is largely unknown. METHODS To examine the association of weight training with risk of T2DM in US men and to assess the influence of combining weight training and aerobic exercise, we performed a prospective cohort study of 32 002 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study observed from 1990 to 2008. Weekly time spent on weight training and aerobic exercise (including brisk walking, jogging, running, bicycling, swimming, tennis, squash, and calisthenics/rowing) was obtained from questionnaires at baseline and biennially during follow-up. RESULTS During 508 332 person-years of follow-up (18 years), we documented 2278 new cases of T2DM. In multivariable-adjusted models, we observed a dose-response relationship between an increasing amount of time spent on weight training or aerobic exercise and lower risk of T2DM (P &lt; .001 for trend). Engaging in weight training or aerobic exercise for at least 150 minutes per week was independently associated with a lower risk of T2DM of 34% (95% CI, 7%-54%) and 52% (95% CI, 45%-58%), respectively. Men who engaged in aerobic exercise and weight training for at least 150 minutes per week had the greatest reduction in T2DM risk (59%; 95% CI, 39%-73%). CONCLUSIONS Weight training was associated with a significantly lower risk of T2DM, independent of aerobic exercise. Combined weight training and aerobic exercise conferred a greater benefit.",Missing
22872770,Systemic corticosteroid monotherapy for clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis: a randomized controlled trial.,CMAJ,Venekamp RP and Bonten MJ and Rovers MM and Verheij TJ and Sachs AP,umcutrecht,"BACKGROUND: Patients with acute rhinosinusitis are frequently encountered in primary care. Although corticosteroids are being increasingly used for symptom control, evidence supporting their use is inconclusive. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroid monotherapy for clinically diagnosed, uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. METHODS: We conducted a block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial at 54 primary care practices (68 family physicians) in the Netherlands between Dec. 30, 2008, and Apr. 28, 2011. Adult patients with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis were randomly assigned to receive either prednisolone 30 mg/d or placebo for 7 days and asked to complete a symptom diary for 14 days. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with resolution of facial pain or pressure on day 7. RESULTS: Of the 185 patients included in the trial (93 in the treatment group, 92 in the placebo group), 2 withdrew from the study and 9 were excluded from the primary analysis because of incomplete symptom reporting. The remaining 174 patients (88 in the treatment group, 86 in the placebo group) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The proportions of patients with resolution of facial pain or pressure on day 7 were 62.5% (55/88) in the prednisolone group and 55.8% (48/86) in the placebo group (absolute risk difference 6.7%, 95% confidence interval -7.9% to 21.2%). The groups were similar with regard to the decrease over time in the proportion of patients with total symptoms (combined symptoms of runny nose, postnasal discharge, nasal congestion, cough and facial pain) and health-related quality of life. Adverse events were mild and did not differ significantly between the groups. INTERPRETATION: Systemic corticosteroid monotherapy had no clinically relevant beneficial effects among patients with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis.

OBJECTIVE To compare national trends and patterns in antipsychotic treatment of adults and youths in office-based medical practice. DESIGN Trends between 1993 and 2009 in visits with antipsychotics for children (0-13 years), adolescents (14-20 years), and adults (>/=21 years) are described on a per population basis and as a proportion of total medical office visits. Background and clinical characteristics of recent (2005-2009) antipsychotic visits are also compared by patient age. SETTING Outpatient visits to physicians in office-based practice. PARTICIPANTS Visits from the 1993-2009 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (N = 484 889). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Visits with a prescription of antipsychotic medications. RESULTS Between 1993-1998 and 2005-2009, visits with a prescription of antipsychotic medications per 100 persons increased from 0.24 to 1.83 for children, 0.78 to 3.76 for adolescents, and 3.25 to 6.18 for adults. The proportion of total visits that included a prescription of antipsychotics increased during this period from 0.16% to 1.07% for youths and from 0.88% to 1.73% for adults. From 2005 to 2009, disruptive behavior disorders were the most common diagnoses in child and adolescent antipsychotic visits, accounting for 63.0% and 33.7%, respectively, while depression (21.2%) and bipolar disorder (20.2%) were the 2 most common diagnoses in adult antipsychotic visits. Psychiatrists provided a larger proportion of the antipsychotic visits for children (67.7%) and adolescents (71.6%) than to adults (50.3%) (P &lt; .001). From 2005 to 2009, antipsychotics were included in 28.8% of adult visits and 31.1% of youth visits to psychiatrists. CONCLUSIONS On a population basis, adults make considerably more medical visits with a prescription of antipsychotics than do adolescents or children. Yet antipsychotic treatment has increased especially rapidly among young people, and recently antipsychotics have been prescribed in approximately the same proportion of youth and adult visits to psychiatrists.",Missing
22840851,Ambient pollen concentrations and emergency department visits for asthma and wheeze.,J Allergy Clin Immunol,Darrow LA and Hess J and Rogers CA and Tolbert PE and Klein M and Sarnat SE,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies report associations between aeroallergen exposure and asthma exacerbations. Aeroallergen burdens and asthma prevalence are increasing worldwide and are projected to increase further with climate change, highlighting the importance of understanding population-level relationships between ambient pollen concentrations and asthma. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine short-term associations between ambient concentrations of various pollen taxa and emergency department (ED) visits for asthma and wheeze in the Atlanta metropolitan area between 1993 and 2004. METHODS: We assessed associations between the 3-day moving average (lag 0-1-2) of Betulaceae (except Alnus species), Cupressaceae, Quercus species, Pinaceae (except Tsuga species), Poaceae, and Ambrosia species pollen concentrations and daily asthma and wheeze ED visit counts, controlling for covarying pollen taxa and ambient pollutant concentrations. RESULTS: We observed a 2% to 3% increase in asthma- and wheeze-related ED visits per SD increase in Quercus species and Poaceae pollen and a 10% to 15% increased risk on days with the highest concentrations (comparing the top 5% of days with the lowest 50% of days). An SD increase in Cupressaceae concentrations was associated with a 1% decrease in ED visits. The association for Quercus species pollen was strongest for children aged 5 to 17 years. Effects of Ambrosia species pollen on asthma exacerbations were difficult to assess in this large-scale temporal analysis because of possible confounding by the steep increase in circulating rhinoviruses every September. CONCLUSION: Poaceae and Quercus species pollen contribute to asthma morbidity in Atlanta. Altered Quercus species and Poaceae pollen production caused by climate change could affect allergen-induced asthma morbidity in the southeastern United States.","Adolescent Age Factors Air Pollution/*adverse effects Asthma/*etiology Child Child, Preschool Emergency Service, Hospital Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Poaceae/immunology Pollen/*immunology Quercus/immunology Respiratory Sounds/*etiology Time Factors"

OBJECTIVE: To compare RARP and LRP in terms of the functional, perioperative, and oncologic outcomes. The main end point of the study was changes in continence 3 mo after surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From January 2010 to January 2011, 120 patients with organ-confined prostate cancer were enrolled and randomly assigned (using a randomisation plan) to one of two groups based on surgical approach: the RARP group and the LRP group. INTERVENTION: All RARP and LRP interventions were performed with the same technique by the same single surgeon. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The demographic, perioperative, and pathologic results, such as the complications and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements, were recorded and compared. Continence was evaluated at the time of catheter removal and 48 h later, and continence and potency were evaluated after 1, 3, 6, and 12 mo. The student t test, Mann-Whitney test, chi(2) test, Pearson chi(2) test, and multiple regression analysis were used for statistics. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The two groups (RARP: n=60; LRP: n=60) were comparable in terms of demographic data. No differences were recorded in terms of perioperative and pathologic results, complication rate, or PSA measurements. The continence rate was higher in the RARP group at every time point: Continence after 3 mo was 80% in the RARP group and 61.6% in the LRP group (p=0.044), and after 1 yr, the continence rate was 95.0% and 83.3%, respectively (p=0.042). Among preoperative potent patients treated with nerve-sparing techniques, the rate of erection recovery was 80.0% and 54.2%, respectively (p=0.020). The limitations included the small number of patients. CONCLUSIONS: RARP provided better functional results in terms of the recovery of continence and potency.

22869877,Do socially deprived urban areas have lesser supplies of cancer care services?,J Clin Oncol,Lamont EB and He Y and Subramanian SV and Zaslavsky AM,harvard,"PURPOSE: Area social deprivation is associated with unfavorable health outcomes of residents across the full clinical course of cancer from the stage at diagnosis through survival. We sought to determine whether area social factors are associated with the area health care supply. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied the area supply of health services required for the provision of guideline-recommended care for patients with breast cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC) in each of the following three distinct clinical domains: screening, treatment, and post-treatment surveillance. We characterized area social factors in 3,096 urban zip code tabulation areas by using Census Bureau data and the health care supply in the corresponding 465 hospital service areas by using American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, and US Food and Drug Administration data. In two-level hierarchical models, we assessed associations between social factors and the supply of health services across areas. RESULTS: We found no clear associations between area social factors and the supply of health services essential to the provision of guideline recommended breast cancer and CRC care in urban areas. The measures of health service included the supply of physicians who facilitate screening, treatment, and post-treatment care and the supply of facilities required for the same services. CONCLUSION: Because we found that the supply of types of health care required for the provision of guideline-recommended cancer care for patients with breast cancer and CRC did not vary with markers of area socioeconomic disadvantage, it is possible that previously reported unfavorable breast cancer and CRC outcomes among individuals living in impoverished areas may have occurred despite an apparent adequate area health care supply.",Aftercare Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*therapy Colorectal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*therapy Female Health Facilities *Health Services Accessibility Humans Male Physicians/supply & distribution *Socioeconomic Factors
22818729,Vegetable variety: an effective strategy to increase vegetable intake in adults.,J Acad Nutr Diet,Meengs JS and Roe LS and Rolls BJ,Missing,"Effective strategies are needed to increase vegetable intake in accordance with health recommendations. Previous research has shown that increasing the variety of foods leads to increased consumption, yet this strategy has not been investigated for promoting vegetable intake. This crossover study, conducted in 2008 and 2009, tested whether filling half the plate with a variety of vegetables influences vegetable consumption and meal energy intake. Once a week for 4 weeks, a meal of pasta and cooked vegetables was consumed ad libitum by 66 adults (34 women, 32 men). The meals were varied in the type of vegetables offered: at three meals 600 g of a single vegetable was served (broccoli, carrots, or snap peas) and at one meal 200 g of each of the three vegetables was served side by side. Data were analyzed using a mixed linear model with repeated measures. In this study, serving a variety of vegetables increased vegetable intake at the meal (P<0.0001). Subjects ate more vegetables when served the variety than when served any single type; the mean increase was 48+/-6 g, or more than one-half serving. This increase remained significant when intake of the variety of vegetables was compared with the preferred vegetable of each participant (mean 25+/-8 g; P=0.002). Vegetable intake was not significantly related to energy intake at the meal. The results of this study demonstrate that increasing the variety of low-energy-dense vegetables served at a meal can be used as a strategy to increase vegetable intake.",Adult Cross-Over Studies Energy Intake/physiology Female Food Habits *Food Preferences Health Promotion/*methods Humans Linear Models Male Middle Aged Nutritional Sciences/*education *Vegetables Young Adult

However, in a rodent model of type 1 diabetes, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) reverses disease by restoring insulin secretion. Specifically, it stimulates innate immunity by inducing the host to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which, in turn, kills disease-causing autoimmune cells and restores pancreatic beta-cell function through regeneration. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Translating these findings to humans, we administered BCG, a generic vaccine, in a proof-of-principle, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adults with long-term type 1 diabetes (mean: 15.3 years) at one clinical center in North America. Six subjects were randomly assigned to BCG or placebo and compared to self, healthy paired controls (n = 6) or reference subjects with (n = 57) or without (n = 16) type 1 diabetes, depending upon the outcome measure. We monitored weekly blood samples for 20 weeks for insulin-autoreactive T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and other autoantibodies, and C-peptide, a marker of insulin secretion. BCG-treated patients and one placebo-treated patient who, after enrollment, unexpectedly developed acute Epstein-Barr virus infection, a known TNF inducer, exclusively showed increases in dead insulin-autoreactive T cells and induction of Tregs. C-peptide levels (pmol/L) significantly rose transiently in two BCG-treated subjects (means: 3.49 pmol/L [95% CI 2.95-3.8], 2.57 [95% CI 1.65-3.49]) and the EBV-infected subject (3.16 [95% CI 2.54-3.69]) vs.1.65 [95% CI 1.55-3.2] in reference diabetic subjects. BCG-treated subjects each had more than 50% of their C-peptide values above the 95(th) percentile of the reference subjects. The EBV-infected subject had 18% of C-peptide values above this level. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that BCG treatment or EBV infection transiently modified the autoimmunity that underlies type 1 diabetes by stimulating the host innate immune response. This suggests that BCG or other stimulators of host innate immunity may have value in the treatment of long-term diabetes.

However, some adult patients continue to have impairing tics. Medications for tics are often effective but can cause adverse effects. Behavior therapy may offer an alternative but has not been examined in a large-scale controlled trial in adults. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of a comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics in adults with Tourette syndrome of at least moderate severity. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial with posttreatment evaluations at 3 and 6 months for positive responders. SETTING: Three outpatient research clinics. PATIENTS: Patients (N = 122; 78 males; age range, 16-69 years) with Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorder were recruited between December 27, 2005, and May 21, 2009. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received 8 sessions of comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics or 8 sessions of supportive treatment for 10 weeks. Patients with a positive response were given 3 monthly booster sessions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total tic score on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale rated by a clinician masked to treatment assignment. RESULTS: Behavior therapy was associated with a significantly greater mean (SD) decrease on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (24.0 [6.47] to 17.8 [7.32]) from baseline to end point compared with the control treatment (21.8 [6.59] to 19.3 [7.40]) (P < .001; effect size = 0.57). Twenty-four of 63 patients (38.1%) were rated as much improved or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale compared with 4 of 63 (6.4%) in the control group (P < .001). Attrition was 13.9%, with no difference across groups. Patients receiving behavior therapy who were available for assessment at 6 months after treatment showed continued benefit.

DESIGN: In June 2010, we systematically examined 207 websites, of which 102 were egg donor agency or IVF clinic websites that both recruited online and displayed compensation amounts. SETTING: The Internet. PATIENT(S): None. INTERVENTION(S): Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Mention of increased payment for particular donor traits, recruitment age less than 21 years, noting risks to donors. RESULT(S): Of the 102 sites, considerable numbers were noncompliant with ASRM's guidelines that prohibit varying compensation based on a donor's traits (34%), and recommend an age of 21 years or older (41%), and presentation of risks alongside compensation (56%). Trait-based payment variation was associated with being an agency rather than a clinic, location in the West, not being endorsed by ASRM or Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART), and referring to ASRM's guidelines about compensation. Of sites mentioning traits, prior donation success was the most commonly paid for trait (64%). CONCLUSION(S): Our data, the first to systematically analyze agency and clinic websites reveal that many do not follow ASRM's guidelines. These data have critical implications for policy, practice, and research, suggesting needs for consideration of possible changes in guidelines, and/or improvements in compliance and monitoring by ASRM or others.","Advertising as Topic/ethics/*standards Female Fertilization in Vitro/economics/ethics/*standards Guideline Adherence/*standards Humans Internet/ethics/*standards Oocyte Donation/economics/ethics/*standards Practice Guidelines as Topic Societies, Medical/standards United States"
22833148,Effect of Massachusetts health insurance reform on mammography use and breast cancer stage at diagnosis.,Cancer,Keating NL and Kouri EM and He Y and West DW and Winer EP,harvard,"BACKGROUND: Massachusetts law requires all residents to maintain a minimum level of health insurance, and rates of uninsurance in that state decreased from 6.4% in 2006 to 1.9% in 2010. The authors of this report assessed whether health insurance expansion was associated with use of mammography and earlier stage at breast cancer diagnosis. METHODS: By using a prereform/postreform design with a concurrent control (California), mammography rates in the last year were assessed using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey and the diagnosis of stage I (vs II/III/IV) breast cancers based on cancer registry data among women ages 41 to 64. Propensity score analyses were used to compare California women who were most similar to women in Massachusetts with Massachusetts women. RESULTS: Among propensity-weighted cohorts, adjusted mammography rates in Massachusetts were 69.2% in 2006, 69.5% in 2008, and 69.0% in 2010. In California, the rates were 59% in 2006, 60.3% in 2008, and 56.2% in 2010 (P = .89 for interaction by state for 2010 vs 2006). Among propensity-weighted cohorts, adjusted rates of diagnosis with stage I cancers were 52.2% in 2006, 53.5% in 2007, and 52.4% in 2008 in Massachusetts versus 46.4% in 2006, 46.3% in 2007, and 45.7% in 2008 in California (P = .58 for interaction by state for 2010 vs 2006). CONCLUSIONS: Health insurance reform in Massachusetts was not associated with increased rates of mammography or earlier stage at diagnosis compared with California, possibly because of insurance and mammography rates that already were high. Additional research is needed to assess the impact of insurance expansions in other populations, especially those with higher uninsurance rates.","Adult Breast Neoplasms/*pathology/radiography California Female Health Care Reform/*legislation & jurisprudence Humans Insurance, Health/*legislation & jurisprudence Mammography/statistics & numerical data/*utilization Massachusetts Middle Aged Neoplasm Staging"
22682882,Effect of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on frequency of beverage consumption among youth in the United States.,J Acad Nutr Diet,Fernandes MM,Missing,"As the largest federal food assistance program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has potential to improve food choices among low-income populations. The program's impact on youth is important because they are represented in more than half of all SNAP households. This study estimates the impact of participation in SNAP, also known as the Food Stamp Program, on the frequency of soft drink, 100% fruit juice, and milk consumption among youth (ages 11 through 14) in the United States. A cohort of 3,126 youth from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey who were surveyed in 2004 (5th grade) and 2007 (8th grade) were used for the analysis. Multivariate linear regression with individual fixed effects was conducted to estimate the effect of SNAP participation on the frequency of consumption of each beverage type in the preceding week. The fixed effects controlled for factors specific to the youth, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and time-invariant bias in reporting SNAP participation or beverage consumption. Overall participation in SNAP increased from 19.5% to 20.3% between 2004 and 2007, with 14.4% reporting a different participation status in 2007 as compared with 2004. SNAP participation was not found to be predictive of the frequency of soft drink, 100% fruit juice, or milk consumption among youth. In its current state, SNAP may serve to replace lost income for qualifying households, but not alter their food and beverage choices.

STUDY DESIGN: We used data for the period 1990-2007 for 47 508 cases of CHD not associated with a chromosomal anomaly from 29 population-based European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies registries in 16 countries covering 7.3 million births. We estimated trends for all CHDs combined and separately for 3 severity groups using random-effects Poisson regression models with splines. RESULTS: We found that the total prevalence of CHDs increased during the 1990s and the early 2000s until 2004 and decreased thereafter. We found essentially no trend in total prevalence of the most severe group (group I), whereas the prevalence of severity group II increased until about 2000 and decreased thereafter. Trends for severity group III (the most prevalent group) paralleled those for all CHDs combined. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CHDs decreased in recent years in Europe in the absence of a policy for mandatory folic acid fortification. One possible explanation for this decrease may be an as-yet-undocumented increase in folic acid intake of women in Europe following recommendations for folic acid supplementation and/or voluntary fortification. However, alternative hypotheses, including reductions in risk factors of CHDs (eg, maternal smoking) and improved management of maternal chronic health conditions (eg, diabetes), must also be considered for explaining the observed decrease in the prevalence of CHDs in Europe or elsewhere.","Europe/epidemiology Heart Defects, Congenital/*epidemiology Humans Infant, Newborn Prevalence Quebec/epidemiology Time Factors"

DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of women with singleton pregnancies who elected to fast and matched controls. SETTING: Four medical centres in Beirut, Lebanon. POPULATION: Women presenting for prenatal care (20-34 weeks of gestation) during the month of Ramadan, September 2008. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively. The frequency of PTD was evaluated in relation to the duration of fasting and the stage of gestation at the time of fasting. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint was the percentage of pregnant women who had PTD, defined as delivery before 37 completed weeks of gestation. RESULTS: A total of 468 women were approached, of whom 402 were included in the study. There were no differences in smoking history and employment. There was no difference in the proportion of women who had PTD at <37 weeks (10.4% versus 10.4%) or PTD at <32 weeks (1.5% versus 0.5%) in the Ramadan-fasted group and the controls, respectively. The PTD rate was also similar in those who fasted before or during the third trimester. The mean birthweight was lower (3094 +/- 467 g versus 3202 +/- 473 g, P = 0.024) and the rate of ketosis and ketonuria was higher in the Ramadan-fasted women. On multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis, fasting was not associated with an increased risk of PTD (odds ratio 0.72; 95% confidence interval 0.34-1.54; P = 0.397).

22854406,beta-Carotene in Golden Rice is as good as beta-carotene in oil at providing vitamin A to children.,Am J Clin Nutr,Tang G and Hu Y and Yin SA and Wang Y and Dallal GE and Grusak MA and Russell RM,tufts,"BACKGROUND: Golden Rice (GR) has been genetically engineered to be rich in beta-carotene for use as a source of vitamin A. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare the vitamin A value of beta-carotene in GR and in spinach with that of pure beta-carotene in oil when consumed by children. DESIGN: Children (n = 68; age 6-8 y) were randomly assigned to consume GR or spinach (both grown in a nutrient solution containing 23 atom% (2)H(2)O) or [(2)H(8)]beta-carotene in an oil capsule. The GR and spinach beta-carotene were enriched with deuterium ((2)H) with the highest abundance molecular mass (M) at M(beta-C)+(2)H(1)(0). [(1)(3)C(1)(0)]Retinyl acetate in an oil capsule was administered as a reference dose. Serum samples collected from subjects were analyzed by using gas chromatography electron-capture negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry for the enrichments of labeled retinol: M(retinol)+4 (from [(2)H(8)]beta-carotene in oil), M(retinol)+5 (from GR or spinach [(2)H(1)(0)]beta-carotene), and M(retinol)+10 (from [(1)(3)C(1)(0)]retinyl acetate). RESULTS: Using the response to the dose of [(1)(3)C(1)(0)]retinyl acetate (0.5 mg) as a reference, our results (with the use of AUC of molar enrichment at days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 after the labeled doses) showed that the conversions of pure beta-carotene (0.5 mg), GR beta-carotene (0.6 mg), and spinach beta-carotene (1.4 mg) to retinol were 2.0, 2.3, and 7.5 to 1 by weight, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The beta-carotene in GR is as effective as pure beta-carotene in oil and better than that in spinach at providing vitamin A to children. A bowl of ~100 to 150 g cooked GR (50 g dry weight) can provide ~60% of the Chinese Recommended Nutrient Intake of vitamin A for 6-8-y-old children.","Child China Corn Oil/chemistry Deuterium Oxide/metabolism Dietary Supplements Female *Food, Genetically Modified Humans Kinetics Male Nutritive Value Oryza sativa/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism Plant Leaves/chemistry/metabolism Plants, Genetically Modified/chemistry/genetics/metabolism Seeds/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism Spinacia oleracea/chemistry/metabolism Vitamin A/administration & dosage/blood/*metabolism Vitamin A Deficiency/prevention & control beta Carotene/administration & dosage/blood/*metabolism"
22863258,Safe infant sleep recommendations on the Internet: let's Google it.,J Pediatr,Chung M and Oden RP and Joyner BL and Sims A and Moon RY,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy of information on infant sleep safety on the Internet using Google. We hypothesized that the majority of Web sites would accurately reflect the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations for infant sleep safety. STUDY DESIGN: We searched for advice using 13 key phrases and analyzed the first 100 Web sites for each phrase. Web sites were categorized by type and assessed for accuracy of information provided, based on AAP recommendations. The accuracy of information was classified as ""accurate,"" ""inaccurate,"" or ""not relevant."" RESULTS: Overall, 43.5% of the 1300 Web sites provided accurate information, 28.1% provided inaccurate information, and 28.4% were not relevant. The search terms ""infant cigarette smoking,"" ""infant sleep position,"" and ""infant sleep surface"" yielded the highest percentage of Web sites with accurate information. ""Pacifier infant,"" ""infant home monitors,"" and ""infant co-sleeping"" produced the lowest percentage of Web sites with accurate information. Government Web sites had the highest rate of accuracy; blogs, the lowest. CONCLUSION: The Internet contains much information about infant sleep safety that is inconsistent with AAP recommendations. Health care providers should realize the extent to which parents may turn to the Internet for information about infant sleep safety.","*Consumer Health Information Humans Infant Infant Care/*methods Infant, Newborn *Internet Pediatrics Practice Guidelines as Topic *Safety *Sleep Societies, Medical United States"
22854409,Low-calorie sweetener consumption is increasing in the United States.,Am J Clin Nutr,Sylvetsky AC and Welsh JA and Brown RJ and Vos MB,emory,"BACKGROUND: Low-calorie and no-calorie sweeteners (LCSs) have emerged as alternatives to added sugars. Research suggests that consumption among all Americans is increasing, yet it is unknown whether consumption trends differ among population subgroups. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to assess recent national trends in LCS consumption among children and other demographic subgroups in the United States. DESIGN: We used NHANES data collected in five 2-y cycles from 1999-2000 to 2007-2008. Consumption of foods and beverages with LCSs was estimated by using one 24-h dietary recall. Estimates of the proportion of the population consuming foods and beverages containing LCSs (prevalence of consumption) were weighted to obtain nationally representative results. Trends in prevalence of LCS consumption and mean intake of beverages sweetened with LCSs were tested by using chi-square tests for trend and F tests. RESULTS: In 2007-2008, the percentage of children and adults consuming foods and beverages containing LCSs increased. The prevalence of consuming beverages with LCSs increased from 6.1% to 12.5% among children (P-trend < 0.0001) and from 18.7% to 24.1% among adults (P < 0.001). Increases in the prevalence of consumption of calorie-containing beverages with LCSs were observed among all weight, age, socioeconomic, and race-ethnicity subgroups in both children and adults. However, little change in consumption of no-calorie beverages with LCSs or LCS-containing foods was found. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of LCS-containing beverages has doubled among US children over the past decade. Further research is needed to understand the health effects of this trend.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors Aged Beverages/analysis Child Child Behavior Child Development Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies *Diet/trends Diet Surveys Diet, Reducing/trends Energy Intake Female Food Analysis Humans Male Middle Aged Sex Characteristics Sweetening Agents/*administration & dosage United States Young Adult"

OBJECTIVE: We estimated the distributions of usual daily sodium and potassium intakes by sociodemographic and health characteristics relative to current recommendations. DESIGN: We used 24-h dietary recalls and other data from 12,581 adults aged >/=20 y who participated in NHANES in 2003-2008. Estimates of sodium and potassium intakes were adjusted for within-individual day-to-day variation by using measurement error models. SEs and 95% CIs were assessed by using jackknife replicate weights. RESULTS: Overall, 99.4% (95% CI: 99.3%, 99.5%) of US adults consumed more sodium daily than recommended by the AHA (<1500 mg), and 90.7% (89.6%, 91.8%) consumed more than the IOM Tolerable Upper Intake Level (2300 mg). In US adults who are recommended by the Dietary Guidelines to further reduce sodium intake to 1500 mg/d (ie, African Americans aged >/=51 y or persons with hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease), 98.8% (98.4%, 99.2%) overall consumed >1500 mg/d, and 60.4% consumed >3000 mg/d-more than double the recommendation. Overall, <2% of US adults and ~5% of US men consumed >/=4700 mg K/d (ie, met recommendations for potassium). CONCLUSION: Regardless of recommendations or sociodemographic or health characteristics, the vast majority of US adults consume too much sodium and too little potassium.","Adult Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Cross-Sectional Studies *Diet/trends Diet Surveys Female Guidelines as Topic Health Promotion Humans Hypertension/prevention & control Male Middle Aged Nutrition Policy Patient Compliance Potassium Deficiency/prevention & control Potassium, Dietary/*administration & dosage Sex Characteristics Sodium, Dietary/*administration & dosage/adverse effects United States Young Adult"
22901802,Small-molecule inhibition of BRDT for male contraception.,Cell,Matzuk MM and McKeown MR and Filippakopoulos P and Li Q and Ma L and Agno JE and Lemieux ME and Picaud S and Yu RN and Qi J and Knapp S and Bradner JE,bcm,"A pharmacologic approach to male contraception remains a longstanding challenge in medicine. Toward this objective, we explored the spermatogenic effects of a selective small-molecule inhibitor (JQ1) of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) subfamily of epigenetic reader proteins. Here, we report potent inhibition of the testis-specific member BRDT, which is essential for chromatin remodeling during spermatogenesis. Biochemical and crystallographic studies confirm that occupancy of the BRDT acetyl-lysine binding pocket by JQ1 prevents recognition of acetylated histone H4. Treatment of mice with JQ1 reduced seminiferous tubule area, testis size, and spermatozoa number and motility without affecting hormone levels. Although JQ1-treated males mate normally, inhibitory effects of JQ1 evident at the spermatocyte and round spermatid stages cause a complete and reversible contraceptive effect. These data establish a new contraceptive that can cross the blood:testis boundary and inhibit bromodomain activity during spermatogenesis, providing a lead compound targeting the male germ cell for contraception.","Animals Azepines/chemistry/*pharmacology Blood-Testis Barrier Contraceptive Agents, Male/chemistry/*pharmacology Female Humans Male Mice Mice, 129 Strain Mice, Inbred C57BL Models, Molecular Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry Protein Structure, Tertiary Sperm Count Sperm Motility/drug effects Spermatozoa/drug effects Testis/cytology/drug effects Triazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology"

The recommendations also address brief alcohol screening, as alcohol accelerates progression of liver disease among HCV-infected individuals. These recommendations augment CDC's 1998 and 1999 recommendations based on risk and medical indications and are not meant to replace those recommendations. METHODS: These recommendations are based on systematic reviews of evidence published from 1995 through February 2012 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Sociological Abstracts, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. Selected studies included cross-sectional and cohort studies that addressed either prevalence of hepatitis C in the United States or clinical outcomes (for example, hepatocellular carcinoma and serious adverse events) among treated patients and systematic reviews of trials that assessed effectiveness of brief screening interventions for alcohol consumption. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework was used to assess quality of the evidence. RECOMMENDATION 1: Adults born during 1945-1965 should receive 1-time testing for HCV without prior ascertainment of HCV risk. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: All persons with identified HCV infection should receive a brief alcohol screening and intervention as clinically indicated, followed by referral to appropriate care and treatment services for HCV infection and related conditions (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).","Aged Alcohol-Related Disorders/complications/diagnosis Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use Hepatitis C Antibodies/blood Hepatitis C, Chronic/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy Humans *Mass Screening Middle Aged Risk Factors"
22818725,Daily apple versus dried plum: impact on cardiovascular disease risk factors in postmenopausal women.,J Acad Nutr Diet,Chai SC and Hooshmand S and Saadat RL and Payton ME and Brummel-Smith K and Arjmandi BH,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that consumption of apple or its bioactive components modulate lipid metabolism and reduce the production of proinflammatory molecules. However, there is a paucity of such research in human beings. OBJECTIVE: Women experience a lower rate of cardiovascular disease before menopause compared with men. However, after the onset of menopause, the risk of cardiovascular disease increases drastically due to ovarian hormone deficiency. Hence, we conducted a 1-year clinical trial to evaluate the effect of dried apple vs dried plum consumption in reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors in postmenopausal women. DESIGN: One-hundred sixty qualified postmenopausal women were recruited from the greater Tallahassee, FL, area during 2007-2009 and were randomly assigned to one of two groups: dried apple (75 g/day) or dried plum (comparative control). Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months to measure various parameters. Physical activity recall and 7-day dietary recall were also obtained. RESULTS: Neither of the dried fruit regimens significantly affected the participants' reported total energy intake throughout the study period. On the contrary, women who consumed dried apple lost 1.5 kg body weight by the end of the study, albeit not significantly different from the dried plum group. In terms of cholesterol, serum total cholesterol levels were significantly lower in the dried apple group compared with the dried plum group only at 6 months. Although dried plum consumption did not significantly reduce serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, it lowered their levels numerically by 3.5% and 8%, respectively, at 12 months compared with baseline. This may explain the lack of significance observed between the groups. However, within the group, women who consumed dried apple had significantly lower serum levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 9% and 16%, respectively, at 3 months compared with baseline. These serum values were further decreased to 13% and 24%, respectively, after 6 months but stayed constant thereafter. The within-group analysis also reported that daily apple consumption profoundly improved atherogenic risk ratios, whereas there were no significant changes in lipid profile or atherogenic risk ratios as a result of dried plum consumption. Both dried fruits were able to lower serum levels of lipid hydroperoxide and C-reactive protein. However, serum C-reactive protein levels were significantly lower in the dried plum group compared with the dried apple group at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences between the dried apple and dried plum groups in altering serum levels of atherogenic cholesterols except total cholesterol at 6 months. However, when within treatment group comparisons are made, consumption of 75 g dried apple (about two medium-sized apples) can significantly lower atherogenic cholesterol levels as early as 3 months. Furthermore, consumption of dried apple and dried plum are beneficial to human health in terms of anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties.",C-Reactive Protein/metabolism Cardiovascular Diseases/blood/*epidemiology/prevention & control Cholesterol/*blood Diet Female Humans Malus/*metabolism Middle Aged Oxidative Stress Postmenopause/blood/*physiology Prunus/*metabolism Risk Factors Triglycerides/blood
22835883,School attendance in childhood cancer survivors and their siblings.,J Pediatr,French AE and Tsangaris E and Barrera M and Guger S and Brown R and Urbach S and Stephens D and Nathan PC,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate school absenteeism among childhood cancer survivors and their siblings and examine factors related to absenteeism in survivors. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted among consecutive cancer survivors attending a large pediatric cancer survivor clinic. Absenteeism rates were obtained for survivors and their closest in age sibling from school report cards. Absenteeism was compared with a population control group of 167752 students using 1-sample t tests. The Child Vulnerability Scale, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, and Behavior Assessment System for Children were administered to survivors. Univariate and multiple regression analyses assessed variables associated with days absent. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one survivors (median age at assessment: 13.4 years, range 8.0-19.2; median age at diagnosis: 9.4 years, range 4.3-17.3) and 77 siblings (median age at assessment: 13 years, age range 7-18) participated. Survivors and siblings missed significantly more school days than the population control group (mean +/- SD: 9.6 +/- 9.2 and 9.9 +/- 9.8 vs 5.0 +/- 5.6 days, respectively, P < .0001). Among matched survivor-sibling pairs (N = 77), there was no difference in absenteeism (9.6 +/- 9.2 vs 9.9 +/- 9.8 days, P = .85). Absenteeism in survivors was significantly associated with a low Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Physical Health Summary Score (P = .01). Parents' perception of their child's vulnerability and emotional and social functioning were not associated with absenteeism. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer survivors and siblings miss more school than the general population. The only predictor of absenteeism in survivors is poor physical quality of health. More research should be devoted to school attendance and other outcomes in siblings of childhood cancer survivors.","*Absenteeism Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Female Humans Male *Neoplasms Schools *Siblings *Survivors Young Adult"
22841611,Differences in outcomes between ICU attending and senior resident physician led medical emergency team responses.,Resuscitation,Morris DS and Schweickert W and Holena D and Handzel R and Sims C and Pascual JL and Sarani B,Missing,"INTRODUCTION: Although rapid response systems (RRS) have been shown to decrease the incidence of cardiac arrest (CA), there are no studies evaluating optimal staffing. We hypothesize that there are no outcome differences between ICU physician and senior resident led events. METHODS: A retrospective study of the RRS database at a single, academic hospital was performed from July 1, 2006 to May 31, 2010. Surgical patients and those in the ICU were excluded. Daytime (D) was defined as 7 am-5 pm Monday through Friday, and weekends were defined as 5 pm on Friday to 6:59 am on Monday. The nurse to patient ratio is constant during all shifts. An ICU physician leads daytime events on weekdays whereas night/weekend (NW) events are led by residents. NW events were compared against D events using chi square or Fischer's exact test. Significance was defined as p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 1404 events were reviewed with 534 (38%) D and 870 (62%) NW events. Respiratory and staff concerns were more likely during NW compared to D (50% vs. 39% and 46% vs. 34%, p<0.001, respectively). Following RRS activation, no difference was noted between D and NW periods in the incidence of progression to CA, transfer to ICU, or hospital mortality. Invasive procedures were more common in the NW period. CONCLUSION: Resident-led RRS may have similar outcomes to attending intensivist led events. Prospective studies are needed to determine the ideal team composition.",Clinical Competence *Emergency Treatment Heart Arrest/*therapy Humans *Intensive Care Units *Internship and Residency/standards *Patient Care Team Retrospective Studies Treatment Outcome

We assess these patterns through analysis of data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS). METHODS: Between Oct 1, 2008, and March 15, 2010, GATS used nationally representative household surveys with comparable methods to obtain relevant information from individuals aged 15 years or older in 14 low-income and middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay, and Vietnam). We compared weighted point estimates and 95% CIs of tobacco use between these 14 countries and with data from the 2008 UK General Lifestyle Survey and the 2006-07 US Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. All these surveys had cross-sectional study designs. FINDINGS: In countries participating in GATS, 48.6% (95% CI 47.6-49.6) of men and 11.3% (10.7-12.0) of women were tobacco users. 40.7% of men (ranging from 21.6% in Brazil to 60.2% in Russia) and 5.0% of women (0.5% in Egypt to 24.4% in Poland) in GATS countries smoked a tobacco product. Manufactured cigarettes were favoured by most smokers (82%) overall, but smokeless tobacco and bidis were commonly used in India and Bangladesh. For individuals who had ever smoked daily, women aged 55-64 years at the time of the survey began smoking at an older age than did equivalently aged men in most GATS countries. However, those individuals who had ever smoked daily and were aged 25-34-years when surveyed started to do so at much the same age in both sexes. Quit ratios were very low (<20% overall) in China, India, Russia, Egypt, and Bangladesh. INTERPRETATION: The first wave of GATS showed high rates of smoking in men, early initiation of smoking in women, and low quit ratios, reinforcing the view that efforts to prevent initiation and promote cessation of tobacco use are needed to reduce associated morbidity and mortality.

Early studies suggest that inhibition of eosinophilic airway inflammation with mepolizumab-a monoclonal antibody against interleukin 5-is associated with a reduced risk of exacerbations. We aimed to establish efficacy, safety, and patient characteristics associated with the response to mepolizumab. METHODS: We undertook a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 81 centres in 13 countries between Nov 9, 2009, and Dec 5, 2011. Eligible patients were aged 12-74 years, had a history of recurrent severe asthma exacerbations, and had signs of eosinophilic inflammation. They were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio) to receive one of three doses of intravenous mepolizumab (75 mg, 250 mg, or 750 mg) or matched placebo (100 mL 0.9% NaCl) with a central telephone-based system and computer-generated randomly permuted block schedule stratified by whether treatment with oral corticosteroids was required. Patients received 13 infusions at 4-week intervals. The primary outcome was the rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations, which were defined as validated episodes of acute asthma requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids, admission, or a visit to an emergency department. Patients, clinicians, and data analysts were masked to treatment assignment. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01000506. FINDINGS: 621 patients were randomised: 159 were assigned to placebo, 154 to 75 mg mepolizumab, 152 to 250 mg mepolizumab, and 156 to 750 mg mepolizumab. 776 exacerbations were deemed to be clinically significant. The rate of clinically significant exacerbations was 2.40 per patient per year in the placebo group, 1.24 in the 75 mg mepolizumab group (48% reduction, 95% CI 31-61%; p<0.0001), 1.46 in the 250 mg mepolizumab group (39% reduction, 19-54%; p=0.0005), and 1.15 in the 750 mg mepolizumab group (52% reduction, 36-64%; p<0.0001). Three patients died during the study, but the deaths were not deemed to be related to treatment.

To characterize the long-term temporal trend and age-at-exposure variation in the radiation-induced risk of thyroid cancer, we analyzed thyroid cancer incidence data for the period from 1958 through 2005 among 105,401 members of the Life Span Study cohort of Japanese atomic-bomb survivors. During the follow-up period, 371 thyroid cancer cases (excluding those with microcarcinoma with a diameter <10 mm) were identified as a first primary among the eligible subjects. Using a linear dose-response model, the excess relative risk of thyroid cancer at 1 Gy of radiation exposure was estimated as 1.28 (95% confidence interval: 0.59-2.70) at age 60 after acute exposure at age 10. The risk decreased sharply with increasing age-at-exposure and there was little evidence of increased thyroid cancer rates for those exposed after age 20. About 36% of the thyroid cancer cases among those exposed before age 20 were estimated to be attributable to radiation exposure. While the magnitude of the excess risk has decreased with increasing attained age or time since exposure, the excess thyroid cancer risk associated with childhood exposure has persisted for >50 years after exposure.","Adolescent Adult Aged Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Japan/epidemiology Male Middle Aged Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology *Nuclear Warfare Nuclear Weapons Risk Factors Survivors Thyroid Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology Time Young Adult"

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. Beneficiaries entered the study upon reaching the coverage gap spending threshold and were observed until an outcome reaching the threshold for catastrophic coverage occurred or year's end. Nine thousand four hundred thirty-six exposed individuals (those who were responsible for drug costs in the gap) were compared with 9,436 unexposed individuals (those who received financial assistance) based on propensity score (PS) or high-dimensional propensity score (hdPS). SETTING: Medicare Part D drug insurance. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred three thousand nine hundred seventy-eight Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older in 2006 and 2007 with linked prescription and medical claims who enrolled in stand-alone Part D or retiree drug plans and reached the gap spending threshold. MEASUREMENTS: Rates of death and hospitalization for any of five cardiovascular outcomes, including acute coronary syndrome with revascularization (ACS), after reaching the coverage gap spending threshold were compared using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: In PS-matched analyses, exposed beneficiaries had higher, albeit not significantly so, hazard of death (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.98-1.59) and ACS (HR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.83-1.62) than unexposed beneficiaries. hdPS-matched analyses minimized residual confounding and confirmed results (death: HR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.78-1.24; ACS: HR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.81-1.41). Exposed beneficiaries were no more or less likely to experience other outcomes than were those who were unexposed. CONCLUSION: During the short-term coverage gap period, having no financial assistance to pay for drugs was not associated with greater risk of death or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes, although long-term health consequences remain unclear.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies Female Humans Male *Medically Uninsured *Medicare Part D Outcome Assessment (Health Care) Prospective Studies United States"

The contribution of infectious diseases to these adverse outcomes is uncertain. Accurate estimates of prevalence data are important for public policy and planning and development of clinical services tailored to homeless people. We aimed to establish the prevalence of tuberculosis, hepatitis C virus, and HIV in homeless people. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature for studies of the prevalence of tuberculosis, hepatitis C virus, and HIV in homeless populations. We also searched bibliographic indices, scanned reference lists, and corresponded with authors. We explored potential sources of heterogeneity in the estimates by metaregression analysis and calculated prevalence ratios to compare prevalence estimates for homeless people with those for the general population. FINDINGS: We identified 43 eligible surveys with a total population of 63,812 (59 736 homeless individuals when duplication due to overlapping samples was accounted for). Prevalences ranged from 0.2% to 7.7% for tuberculosis, 3.9% to 36.2% for hepatitis C virus infection, and 0.3% to 21.1% for HIV infection. We noted substantial heterogeneity in prevalence estimates for tuberculosis, hepatitis C virus infection, and HIV infection (all Cochran's chi(2) significant at p<0.0001; I(2)=83%, 95% CI 76-89; 95%, 94-96; and 94%, 93-95; respectively). Prevalence ratios ranged from 34 to 452 for tuberculosis, 4 to 70 for hepatitis C virus infection, and 1 to 77 for HIV infection. Tuberculosis prevalence was higher in studies in which diagnosis was by chest radiography than in those which used other diagnostic methods and in countries with a higher general population prevalence than in those with a lower general prevalence. Prevalence of HIV infection was lower in newer studies than in older ones and was higher in the USA than in the rest of the world. INTERPRETATION: Heterogeneity in prevalence estimates for tuberculosis, hepatitis C virus, and HIV suggests the need for local surveys to inform development of health services for homeless people. The role of targeted and population-based measures in the reduction of risks of infectious diseases, premature mortality, and other adverse outcomes needs further examination. Guidelines for screening and treatment of infectious diseases in homeless people might need to be reviewed.

DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort. SETTING: Leisure World, Laguna Hills, CA; a retirement community. PARTICIPANTS: Five thousand four hundred sixty-eight older (median age 81) adults followed from 1992 to 2010. MEASUREMENTS: Questions regarding dental health focused on number of natural teeth, dentures worn, number of visits to a dentist, and oral health habits. Dementia status was determined from in-person evaluations, follow-up questionnaires, hospital data, and death certificates. Estimates of dementia risk were calculated using Cox regression analysis in men and women separately. RESULTS: Men with inadequate natural masticatory function who did not wear dentures had a 91% greater risk of dementia than those with adequate natural masticatory function (>/= 10 upper teeth and >/= 6 lower teeth). This risk was also greater in women but not significantly so. Dentate individuals who reported not brushing their teeth daily had a 22% to 65% greater risk of dementia than those who brushed three times daily. CONCLUSION: In addition to helping maintain natural, healthy, functional teeth, oral health behaviors are associated with lower risk of dementia in older adults.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies *Dementia *Dentition Female *Health Behavior Humans Male Middle Aged Oral Hygiene/*statistics & numerical data"
22915789,Failure of a novel silicone-polyurethane copolymer (Optim) to prevent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead insulation abrasions.,Europace,Hauser RG and Abdelhadi RH and McGriff DM and Kallinen Retel L,Missing,"AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine if Optim, a unique copolymer of silicone and polyurethane, protects Riata ST Optim and Durata implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) leads (SJM, St Jude Medical Inc., Sylmar, CA, USA) from abrasions that cause lead failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Manufacturers and User Device Experience (MAUDE) database on 13 April 2012 using the simple search terms 'Riata ST Optim abrasion analysis' and 'Durata abrasion analysis'. Lead implant time was estimated by subtracting 3 months from the reported lead age. The MAUDE search returned 15 reports for Riata ST Optim and 37 reports for Durata leads, which were submitted by SJM based on its analyses of returned leads for clinical events that occurred between December 2007 and January 2012. Riata ST Optim leads had been implanted 29.1 +/- 11.7 months. Eight of 15 leads had can abrasions and three abrasions were caused by friction with another device, most likely another lead. Four of these abrasions resulted in high-voltage failures and one death. One failure was caused by an internal insulation defect. Durata leads had been implanted 22.2 +/- 10.6 months. Twelve Durata leads had can abrasions, and six leads had abrasions caused by friction with another device. Of these 18 can and other device abrasions, 13 (72%) had electrical abnormalities. Low impedances identified three internal insulation abrasions. CONCLUSIONS: Riata ST Optim and Durata ICD leads have failed due to insulation abrasions. Optim did not prevent these abrasions, which developed </= 4 years after implant. Studies are needed to determine the incidence of these failures and their clinical implications.","Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*therapy Databases, Factual Defibrillators, Implantable/*adverse effects Electric Impedance Electrodes, Implanted/*adverse effects *Equipment Failure Analysis Humans Polyethylene Glycols/*adverse effects Silicones/*adverse effects Time Factors United States United States Food and Drug Administration"

We examined temporal trends in the incidence and outcomes of heart failure in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: Using population-based administrative databases of hospital discharge abstracts and physician health insurance claims, we identified 419 551 incident cases of heart failure in Ontario between Apr. 1, 1997, and Mar. 31, 2008. All patients were classified as either inpatients or outpatients based on the patient's location at the time of the initial diagnosis. We tracked subsequent outcomes through linked administrative databases. RESULTS: The age- and sex-standardized incidence of heart failure decreased 32.7% from 454.7 per 100 000 people in 1997 to 306.1 per 100 000 people in 2007 (p < 0.001). A comparable decrease in incidence occurred in both inpatient and outpatient settings. The greatest relative decrease occurred in patients aged 85 and over. Over the study period, 1-year risk-adjusted mortality decreased from 17.7% in 1997 to 16.2% in 2007 (p = 0.02) for outpatients, with a nonsignificant decrease from 35.7% in 1997 to 33.8% in 2007 (p = 0.1) for inpatients. INTERPRETATION: The incidence of heart failure decreased substantially during the study period. Nevertheless, the prognosis for patients with heart failure remains poor and is associated with high mortality.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Female Heart Failure/*epidemiology/mortality Hospitalization/trends Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Ontario/epidemiology Prognosis Young Adult"

The rate of de novo mutations is therefore of major importance to evolution. Here we conduct a study of genome-wide mutation rates by sequencing the entire genomes of 78 Icelandic parent-offspring trios at high coverage. We show that in our samples, with an average father's age of 29.7, the average de novo mutation rate is 1.20 x 10(-8) per nucleotide per generation. Most notably, the diversity in mutation rate of single nucleotide polymorphisms is dominated by the age of the father at conception of the child. The effect is an increase of about two mutations per year. An exponential model estimates paternal mutations doubling every 16.5 years. After accounting for random Poisson variation, father's age is estimated to explain nearly all of the remaining variation in the de novo mutation counts. These observations shed light on the importance of the father's age on the risk of diseases such as schizophrenia and autism.","Adult Autistic Disorder/epidemiology/etiology/*genetics Chromosomes, Human/genetics Female *Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genome, Human/genetics Humans Iceland/epidemiology Male Middle Aged Mothers *Mutation Rate Ovum/metabolism *Paternal Age Pedigree Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics Risk Factors Schizophrenia/epidemiology/etiology/*genetics Selection, Genetic/genetics Sequence Analysis, DNA Spermatozoa/metabolism Young Adult"

DESIGN A retrospective cost analysis of ST was compared with a projected cost analysis of RT using institution-specific data. SETTING Endocrine surgery division at an academic center. PARTICIPANTS Standard open thyroidectomy data from 2 high-volume endocrine surgeons vs published variables from high-volume RT surgeons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES A cost analysis was performed for ST (Current Procedural Technology code 60240). The cost of RT was estimated as operative time plus anesthesia fees plus consumables plus the robotic system (da Vinci Surgical System; Intuitive Surgical, Inc). Institution-specific data were collected for ST, and only those costs that varied between ST and RT were included in the analysis. The mean operative time for ST was based on data from 2 high-volume endocrine surgeons at our institution. The RT operative data were extracted from published series of high-volume RT surgeons. RESULTS The relative costs calculated were $2668 for ST vs $5795 for RT. This represents a 217% increased cost of RT compared with ST. The mean operative times were 113 minutes for ST vs 137 minutes for RT. CONCLUSIONS Technologic advances are paramount in providing the best medical care for patients. This progress must be tempered by a rational, open discussion about the costs of these advancements. Only then can the proposed benefits of a new technology be weighed accurately against the overall societal cost. Surgeons need to be aware of the cost of their technologic choices and the burdens that those place on limited resources.",Missing

BACKGROUND: Some, but not all, randomized trials have reported increased rates of stroke with CABG compared with PCI. However, all these studies were powered insufficiently to examine differences in the risk of stroke reliably. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of 19 trials in which 10,944 patients were randomized to CABG versus PCI. The primary end point was the 30-day rate of stroke. We also determined the rate of stroke at the midterm follow-up and investigated whether there was an interaction between revascularization type and the extent of coronary artery disease on the relative risk of stroke. RESULTS: The 30-day rate of stroke was 1.20% after CABG compared with 0.34% after PCI (odds ratio: 2.94, 95% confidence interval: 1.69 to 5.09, p < 0.0001). Similar results were observed after a median follow-up of 12.1 months (1.83% vs. 0.99%, odds ratio: 1.67, 95% confidence interval: 1.09 to 2.56, p = 0.02). The extent of coronary artery disease (single vessel vs. multivessel vs. left main) did not affect the relative increase in the risk of stroke observed with CABG compared with PCI at either 30 days (p = 0.57 for interaction) or midterm follow-up (p = 0.08 for interaction). Similar results were observed when the outcomes in 33,980 patients from 27 observational studies were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Coronary revascularization by CABG compared with PCI is associated with an increased risk of stroke at 30 days and at the mid-term follow-up.","Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary/*adverse effects Coronary Artery Bypass/*adverse effects Humans Risk Assessment Stroke/epidemiology/*etiology"
22908108,"Breastfeeding, childhood milk consumption, and onset of puberty.",Pediatrics,Kwok MK and Leung GM and Lam TH and Schooling CM,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: Early nutrition has been postulated as programming pubertal timing. Limited observational studies, mainly from Western settings, suggest puberty occurs later with breastfeeding and earlier with higher cow's milk (including infant formula) consumption. However, these observations may be socioeconomically confounded. This study examined whether breastfeeding or childhood milk consumption was associated with pubertal onset in a setting with different associations of breastfeeding and puberty with socioeconomic position. METHODS: The adjusted associations of breastfeeding or milk consumption at 6 months, 3 years, and 5 years with clinically assessed age at pubertal onset (Tanner stage II) were assessed by using interval-censored regression in a population-representative Hong Kong Chinese birth cohort, ""Children of 1997,"" with 90% follow-up (N = 7523). RESULTS: Compared with never breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding for 3+ months was unrelated to age at pubertal onset (time ratio [TR] 1.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.987-1.015), as was partial breastfeeding for any length of time or exclusive breastfeeding for <3 months (TR 1.003, 95% CI 0.996-1.010), adjusted for gender, socioeconomic position, birth weight-for-gestational age, birth order, second-hand smoke exposure, and mother's age and place of birth. Daily milk consumption at 6 months (TR 1.004, 95% CI 0.991-1.018), 3 years (TR 0.995, 95% CI 0.982-1.008), or 5 years (TR 0.998, 95% CI 0.988-1.009) was also unrelated to age at pubertal onset compared with milk consumption for </= 1 time per week at the corresponding ages. CONCLUSIONS: In a non-Western setting, neither breastfeeding nor childhood milk consumption was associated with age at pubertal onset, suggesting that associations may vary by setting.","Adolescent Age of Onset Animals *Breast Feeding Child Child, Preschool Female Hong Kong Humans Infant Infant Formula Male *Milk *Puberty"
22917005,Family history of premature death and risk of early onset cardiovascular disease.,J Am Coll Cardiol,Ranthe MF and Carstensen L and Oyen N and Tfelt-Hansen J and Christiansen M and McKenna WJ and Wohlfahrt J and Melbye M and Boyd HA,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a family history of premature death, cardiovascular death in particular, on the risk of early cardiovascular disease. BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that fatal cardiovascular events and less severe cardiovascular diseases may co-occur in families. Consequently, a family history of premature death may indicate a familial cardiac frailty that predisposes to early cardiovascular disease. METHODS: We ascertained family history of premature death (age <60 years) in all individuals born in Denmark from 1950 to 2008 and followed this cohort for early cardiovascular disease (age <50 years). Using Poisson regression, we estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) reflecting the effect of premature death in the family on early cardiovascular disease risk. RESULTS: Among 3,985,301 persons followed up for 89,294,258 person-years, 129,825, 31,172, and 5,214 were diagnosed with any early cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, and ventricular arrhythmia, respectively. IRRs for these conditions given a history of premature cardiovascular death in first-degree relatives were 1.72 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.68 to 1.77), 2.21 (95% CI: 2.11 to 2.31), and 1.94 (95% CI: 1.70 to 2.20), respectively. With >/=2 cardiovascular deaths in a family, corresponding IRRs were 3.30 (95% CI: 2.77 to 3.94), 5.00 (95% CI: 3.87 to 6.45), and 6.18 (95% CI: 3.32 to 11.50). The IRR for any early cardiovascular disease given a family history of premature noncardiovascular death was significantly lower, 1.12 (95% CI: 1.10 to 1.14) (p(cardiac vs. noncardiac) < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Family history of premature cardiovascular death was consistently and significantly associated with a risk of early cardiovascular disease, suggesting an inherited cardiac vulnerability. These results should be kept in mind when assessing cardiovascular disease risk in persons with a family history of premature cardiovascular death.","Adolescent Adult Age of Onset Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*epidemiology/genetics Child Child, Preschool Denmark/epidemiology Female Humans Infant Male Middle Aged *Mortality, Premature Myocardial Ischemia/*epidemiology/genetics Risk Factors Young Adult"

DESIGN: Fatality age was categorized as 21 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, or 70 and older, and road user was categorized as driver, passenger, or pedestrian. Estimated number of trips made by each age group was used to adjust for exposure and to measure individual risk. SETTING: Fatalities recorded in Britain between 1989 and 2009. PARTICIPANTS: Population-wide fatal injury counts in Britain. MEASUREMENTS: Age of fatally injured drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Estimated number of trips made per year by drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. RESULTS: Risk of fatal injury, but not fatality numbers in the population, were higher for older adult (>/= 70) drivers than for younger age groups. Risk of fatal injury was also high for older adult passengers and pedestrians, who represented the majority of older adult fatalities. CONCLUSION: Previous emphasis on driver impairment in older age has unduly focussed attention on elderly drivers, who represent a minority of all driver fatalities. Older adults represent a much larger proportion of passenger and pedestrian fatalities. Additional policy schemes and initiatives should be targeted at safeguarding older adult passengers and making the road environment safer for elderly pedestrians.","Accidents, Traffic/*mortality Adult Age Distribution Aged Automobile Driving/*statistics & numerical data Humans Middle Aged Risk Young Adult"

We determined whether a racial quality of care gap exists in surgical care for prostate cancer, as evidenced by racial variation in the use of high volume surgeons and facilities, and in the quality of certain outcome measures of care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed cross-sectional and cohort analyses of administrative data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project all-payer State Inpatient Databases, encompassing all nonfederal hospitals in Florida, Maryland and New York State from 1996 to 2007. Included in analysis were men 18 years old or older with a diagnosis of prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy. We compared the use of surgeons and/or hospitals in the top quartile of annual volume for this procedure, inpatient blood transfusion, complications, mortality and length of stay between black and white patients. RESULTS: Of 105,972 patients 81,112 (76.5%) were white, 14,006 (13.2%) were black, 6,999 (6.6%) were Hispanic and 3,855 (3.6%) were all other.

METHODS: A systematic review of literature and IPD meta-analyses included trials assessing the acute effects of shorts bouts of PA on SoD and DtS among temporarily abstaining smokers not using pharmaceutical aids for smoking cessation. Authors of eligible studies were contacted and raw IPD were obtained. Two-stage and one-stage IPD random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. Participants engaging in PA were compared against control participants, using post-intervention SoD and DtS with baseline adjustments. RESULTS: A two-stage IPD meta-analysis assessing effects of PA on SoD yielded an average standardized mean difference (SMD) between PA and control conditions (across 15 primary studies) of -1.91 [95% confidence interval (CI): -2.59 to -1.22]. A two-stage IPD meta-analysis assessing effects of PA on DtS yielded an average SMD between PA and control conditions (across 17 primary studies) of -2.03 (95% CI: -2.60 to -1.46). Additional meta-analyses, including those using a one-stage model, those including only parallel arm studies and meta-analyses comparing only moderate exercise against a control condition, showed significant craving reduction following PA. Despite a high degree of between-study heterogeneity, effects sizes of all primary studies were in the same direction, with PA showing a greater reduction in cravings compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence that physical activity acutely reduces cigarette craving.","Behavior, Addictive/*psychology Exercise/physiology/*psychology Humans Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Smoking/*psychology Tobacco Products"

We evaluated whether overall survival in hormone naive patients with metastatic prostate cancer has improved during the era of prostate specific antigen use. We also assessed whether any patient subsets benefited differentially during this period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared overall survival in 3 sequential phase III trials of 3,096 men with hormone naive, metastatic prostate cancer who received similar androgen deprivation therapy, including 2 trials performed before the prostate specific antigen era (S8494 and S8894) and the other done during this era (S9346). Overall survival was adjusted for patient and disease risk factors in the latter 2 trials. Subgroups were evaluated by interactions of risk factors with trial. RESULTS: Median overall survival was 30 months in S8494, 33 months in S8894 and 49 months in S9346. Adjusting for risk factors, there was a 22% lower risk of death in S9346 than in S8894 (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70, 0.87, p <0.001). The improvement in overall survival was greater in black American men (test of interaction p = 0.008). In S8494 and S8894 median survival for black men was 27 months, and 34 and 35 months for nonblack men, respectively. This racial difference disappeared in S9346 with overall survival of 48 and 49 months in black and nonblack men, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adjusting for risk factors, overall survival was significantly improved in the post-prostate specific antigen era trial. However, it cannot be concluded that this was attributable only to prostate specific antigen monitoring. Black men now have overall survival comparable to that of white men. Current estimates of survival should be used to design new trials in this population.","Aged Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplasm Metastasis Prostatic Neoplasms/*mortality/*pathology Survival Rate/trends"

STUDY DESIGN: This was a 2-year, prospective, open-label clinical trial of extended-release methylphenidate for smoking prevention in adolescents with ADHD (n = 154). Smoking outcomes were assessed with the Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire. Comparisons were made using data from a historical, naturalistic sample of ADHD (n = 103) and non-ADHD comparators (n = 188) of similar age and sex assessed with the same assessment battery as that used in subjects participating in the clinical trial. RESULTS: The smoking rate at endpoint (mean, 10 months of methylphenidate treatment) was low in the clinical trial subjects and not significantly different from that in the non-ADHD comparators or the ADHD comparators receiving stimulants naturalistically (7.1% vs 8.0% vs 10.9%; P > .20). In contrast, the smoking rate was significantly lower in the clinical trial subjects than in the naturalistic sample of ADHD comparators who were not receiving stimulant treatment (7.1% vs 19.6%; P = .009 [not significant], adjusting for comorbid conduct disorder and alcohol and drug abuse). CONCLUSION: Although considered preliminary until replicated in future randomized clinical trials, the findings from this single-site, open-label study suggest that stimulant treatment may contribute to a decreased risk for smoking in adolescents with ADHD.

This study systematically reviewed evidence regarding vocational interventions for individuals with ASD between the ages of 13 and 30 years. METHODS: The Medline, PsycINFO, and ERIC databases (1980-December 2011) and reference lists of included articles were searched. Two reviewers independently assessed each study against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted data regarding participant and intervention characteristics, assessment techniques, and outcomes, and assigned overall quality and strength of evidence ratings based on predetermined criteria. RESULTS: Five studies were identified; all were of poor quality and all focused on on-the-job supports as the employment/vocational intervention. Short-term studies reported that supported employment was associated with improvements in quality of life (1 study), ASD symptoms (1 study), and cognitive functioning (1 study). Three studies reported that interventions increased rates of employment for young adults with ASD. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have been conducted to assess vocational interventions for adolescents and young adults with ASD. As such, there is very little evidence available for specific vocational treatment approaches as individuals transition to adulthood. All studies of vocational approaches were of poor quality, which may reflect the recent emergence of this area of research. Individual studies suggest that vocational programs may increase employment success for some; however, our ability to understand the overall benefit of supported employment programs is limited given the existing research.","Adolescent Adult Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/psychology/*therapy Cognition *Employment, Supported Humans Quality of Life Young Adult"
22928175,Complications associated with alloplastic implants in rhinoplasty.,Arch Facial Plast Surg,Winkler AA and Soler ZM and Leong PL and Murphy A and Wang TD and Cook TA,UCDenver,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of infection and extrusion of porous high-density polyethylene (pHDPE) and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) implants used in rhinoplasty at a high-volume, academic facial plastic surgery practice. METHODS: A total of 662 rhinoplasty procedures performed by 3 faculty surgeons from 1999 to 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, medical comorbidities, operative details, and postoperative course findings were collected from patient records. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative infection was 2.8% (19 of 662 patients). In each case of infection, alloplastic material had been used. Infections occurred in 1 in 5 rhinoplasty procedures in which pHDPE implants were used. In patients in whom ePTFE was used alone, the infection rate was 5.3%. Exposure developed in 12% of patients in whom an alloplast was used during surgery. Factors notably not associated with infection on bivariate analysis included sex, surgeon, purpose of procedure (functional vs cosmetic), current tobacco use, or history of cocaine use (P > .05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study represents the largest evaluation of the use of pHDPE implants in rhinoplasty to date.

22928178,Midlife fitness and the development of chronic conditions in later life.,Arch Intern Med,Willis BL and Gao A and Leonard D and Defina LF and Berry JD,Missing,"BACKGROUND The association between cardiorespiratory fitness (fitness) and mortality is well described. However, the association between midlife fitness and the development of nonfatal chronic conditions in older age has not been studied. METHODS To examine the association between midlife fitness and chronic disease outcomes in later life, participant data from the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study were linked with Medicare claims. We studied 18 670 healthy participants (21.1% women; median age, 49 years) who survived to receive Medicare coverage from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2009. Fitness estimated by Balke treadmill time was analyzed as a continuous variable (in metabolic equivalents [METs]) and according to age- and sex-specific quintiles. Eight common chronic conditions were defined using validated algorithms, and associations between midlife fitness and the number of conditions were assessed using a modified Cox proportional hazards model that stratified the at-risk population by the number of conditions while adjusting for age, body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose levels, alcohol use, and smoking. RESULTS After 120 780 person-years of Medicare exposure with a median follow-up of 26 years, the highest quintile of fitness (quintile 5) was associated with a lower incidence of chronic conditions compared with the lowest quintile (quintile 1) in men (15.6 [95% CI, 15.0-16.2] vs 28.2 [27.4-29.0] per 100 person-years) and women (11.4 [10.5-12.3] vs 20.1 [18.7 vs 21.6] per 100 person-years). After multivariate adjustment, higher fitness (in METs) was associated with a lower risk of developing chronic conditions in men (hazard ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.94-0.96] per MET) and women (0.94 [0.91-0.96] per MET). Among decedents (2406 [12.9%]), higher fitness was associated with lower risk of developing chronic conditions relative to survival (compression hazard ratio, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.88-0.92] per MET), suggesting morbidity compression. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort of healthy middle-aged adults, fitness was significantly associated with a lower risk of developing chronic disease outcomes during 26 years of follow-up. These findings suggest that higher midlife fitness may be associated with the compression of morbidity in older age.",Missing

Concomitantly, adolescents are initiating cannabis use at younger ages, and more adolescents are using cannabis on a daily basis. The purpose of the present study was to test the association between persistent cannabis use and neuropsychological decline and determine whether decline is concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users. Participants were members of the Dunedin Study, a prospective study of a birth cohort of 1,037 individuals followed from birth (1972/1973) to age 38 y. Cannabis use was ascertained in interviews at ages 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 y. Neuropsychological testing was conducted at age 13 y, before initiation of cannabis use, and again at age 38 y, after a pattern of persistent cannabis use had developed. Persistent cannabis use was associated with neuropsychological decline broadly across domains of functioning, even after controlling for years of education. Informants also reported noticing more cognitive problems for persistent cannabis users. Impairment was concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users, with more persistent use associated with greater decline. Further, cessation of cannabis use did not fully restore neuropsychological functioning among adolescent-onset cannabis users. Findings are suggestive of a neurotoxic effect of cannabis on the adolescent brain and highlight the importance of prevention and policy efforts targeting adolescents.",Adolescent Adult Age Factors Cohort Studies Humans Least-Squares Analysis Longitudinal Studies Marijuana Smoking/*adverse effects/*epidemiology Mental Processes/*drug effects Neuropsychological Tests Prospective Studies Regression Analysis

However, there is a growing clinical need for MRI, without an acceptable alternative imaging modality in many patients with cardiac devices. The purpose of this study was to determine the risk of MRI at 1.5 T for patients with cardiac devices by measuring the frequency of device failures and clinically relevant device parameter changes. Data from a single-center retrospective review of 109 patients with pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (the MRI group) who underwent 125 clinically indicated MRI studies were compared to data from a prospective cohort of 50 patients with cardiac devices who did not undergo MRI (the control group). In the MRI group, there were no deaths, device failures requiring generator or lead replacement, induced arrhythmias, losses of capture, or electrical reset episodes. Decreases in battery voltage of >/=0.04 V occurred in 4%, pacing threshold increases of >/=0.5 V in 3%, and pacing lead impedance changes of >/=50 Omega in 6%. Although there were statistically significant differences between the MRI and control groups for the mean change in pacing lead impedance (-6.2 +/- 23.9 vs 3.0 +/- 22.1 Omega) and left ventricular pacing threshold (-0.1 +/- 0.3 vs 0.1 +/- 0.2 V), these differences were not clinically important. In conclusion, MRI in patients with cardiac devices resulted in no device or lead failures. A small number of clinically relevant changes in device parameter measurements were noted. However, these changes were similar to those in a control group of patients who did not undergo MRI.","Aged Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*diagnosis/therapy *Defibrillators, Implantable Equipment Design Equipment Failure/*statistics & numerical data Equipment Safety Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine/adverse effects/*contraindications/instrumentation Male *Pacemaker, Artificial Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment/*methods Risk Factors"

CR is frequently used as a tool to understand mechanisms behind ageing and age-associated diseases. In addition to and independently of increasing lifespan, CR has been reported to delay or prevent the occurrence of many chronic diseases in a variety of animals. Beneficial effects of CR on outcomes such as immune function, motor coordination and resistance to sarcopenia in rhesus monkeys have recently been reported. We report here that a CR regimen implemented in young and older age rhesus monkeys at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) has not improved survival outcomes. Our findings contrast with an ongoing study at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (WNPRC), which reported improved survival associated with 30% CR initiated in adult rhesus monkeys (7-14 years) and a preliminary report with a small number of CR monkeys. Over the years, both NIA and WNPRC have extensively documented beneficial health effects of CR in these two apparently parallel studies. The implications of the WNPRC findings were important as they extended CR findings beyond the laboratory rodent and to a long-lived primate. Our study suggests a separation between health effects, morbidity and mortality, and similar to what has been shown in rodents, study design, husbandry and diet composition may strongly affect the life-prolonging effect of CR in a long-lived nonhuman primate.","Age of Onset Aging/*physiology Animals Blood Glucose/analysis *Caloric Restriction Cardiovascular Diseases/blood Cholesterol/blood Female *Health Humans Incidence Kaplan-Meier Estimate Longevity/*physiology Macaca mulatta Male Models, Animal Monkey Diseases/blood *National Institute on Aging (U.S.) Neoplasms/blood Survival Rate Triglycerides/blood Uncertainty United States"
22892151,"Prospective, randomized comparison of self-reported postoperative dry eye and visual fluctuation in LASIK and photorefractive keratectomy.",Ophthalmology,Murakami Y and Manche EE,Missing,"PURPOSE: We sought to prospectively compare postoperative symptoms of dry eye, visual fluctuations, and foreign body sensation in patients undergoing LASIK and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-eight eyes of 34 patients were treated with wavefront-guided LASIK and PRK. METHODS: One eye was treated with LASIK and the fellow eye was treated with PRK. Eyes were randomized by ocular dominance. Patients completed a questionnaire preoperatively and at each postoperative visit evaluating symptoms of dry eye, dry eye severity, vision fluctuations, and foreign body sensation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in self-reported dry eye with secondary outcome measure of visual fluctuations and foreign body sensation scores after LASIK and PRK. RESULTS: Both groups of eyes experienced significant increases in symptoms of dry eye, vision fluctuation, and foreign body sensation after LASIK and PRK at postoperative months 1, 3, and 6. However, by the 12-month postoperative visit, there was no increase in dry eye symptoms over the preoperative baseline levels in either group. Patients undergoing PRK experienced significantly higher levels of vision fluctuation at postoperative month 1 than those undergoing LASIK. CONCLUSIONS: Both LASIK and PRK caused an increase in dry eye symptoms and severity, vision fluctuations, and foreign body sensation over baseline in the early postoperative period. At postoperative month 1, PRK caused greater vision fluctuations than LASIK. By 1 year postoperatively, all symptoms of dry eye, vision fluctuations, and foreign body sensation returned to their baseline, preoperative levels.","Adult Dominance, Ocular Dry Eye Syndromes/diagnosis/*etiology Female Humans Keratomileusis, Laser In Situ/*adverse effects Lasers, Excimer/therapeutic use Male Middle Aged Photorefractive Keratectomy/*adverse effects *Postoperative Complications Prospective Studies Questionnaires Self Report Severity of Illness Index Vision Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology Visual Acuity/physiology"

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Many patients are eligible for more than one treatment option for prostate cancer. In usual care, urologists have a large influence on the treatment choice. Decision aids, providing balanced information on the pros and cons of different treatment options, improve the match between patient preferences and treatment received. In men eligible for both surgery and external beam radiotherapy, treatment choice differed by hospital. Across the participating hospitals, the decision aid consistently led to fewer patients remaining undecided on their treatment preference and more patients choosing brachytherapy. OBJECTIVES: To examine the treatment choice for localized prostate cancer in selected men who were eligible for both prostatectomy and radiotherapy. To examine whether increased patient participation, using a decision aid, affected the treatment choice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2008 to 2011, 240 patients with localized prostate cancer were enrolled from three separate hospitals. They were selected to be eligible for both prostatectomy and external beam radiotherapy. Brachytherapy was a third option for about half of the patients. In this randomized controlled trial, patients were randomized to a group which only discussed their treatment with their specialist (usual care group) and a group which received additional information from a decision aid presented by a researcher (decision aid group). The decision aid was based on a literature review. Predictors of treatment choice were examined. RESULTS: Treatment choice was affected by the decision aid (P = 0.03) and by the hospital of intake (P < 0.001). The decision aid led to more patients choosing brachytherapy (P = 0.02) and fewer patients remaining undecided (P < 0.05). Prostatectomy remained the most frequently preferred treatment. Age, tumour characteristics or pretreatment urinary, bowel or erectile functioning did not affect the choice in this selected group. Patients choosing brachytherapy assigned more weight to convenience of the procedure and to maintaining erectile function. CONCLUSIONS: Traditionally, patient characteristics differ between surgery and radiotherapy groups, but not in this selected group of patients. Men eligible for both prostatectomy and radiotherapy mostly preferred prostatectomy, and the treatment choice was influenced by the hospital they visited. Giving patients evidence-based information, by means of a decision aid, led to an increase in brachytherapy.","Aged Choice Behavior *Decision Support Techniques Disease-Free Survival Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplasm Invasiveness/pathology Neoplasm Staging Netherlands Patient Participation Patient Preference/*statistics & numerical data Patient Selection Prognosis Prospective Studies Prostatectomy/*methods/mortality Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy/*surgery Radiotherapy, Conformal/*methods/mortality Risk Assessment Survival Rate Treatment Outcome"

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The 69 457 individuals who registered for drug treatment in Scotland during 1 April 1996-31 March 2006. MEASUREMENTS: Time-at-risk was from the date of an individual's first attendance at drug treatment services after 1 April 1996 until the earlier date of death or end-of-study, 31 March 2006, and was categorized according to time since the most recent hospitalization, as during hospitalization, within 28 days, 29-90 days, 91 days to 1 year and >1 year since discharge from most recent hospital stay versus 'never admitted' (reference). FINDINGS: Time-periods soon after discharge were associated with increased risk of DRD.

A recent Danish study reported that the daily intake of an AS beverage was associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery. OBJECTIVE: We examined the intake of AS and SS beverages in pregnant women to replicate the Danish study and observe whether AS intake is indeed associated with preterm delivery. DESIGN: This was a prospective study of 60,761 pregnant women in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Intakes of carbonated and noncarbonated AS and SS beverages and use of artificial sweeteners in hot drinks were assessed by a self-reported food-frequency questionnaire in midpregnancy. Preterm delivery was the primary outcome, and data were obtained from the Norwegian Medical Birth Registry. RESULTS: Intakes of both AS and SS beverages increased with increasing BMI and energy intake and were higher in women with less education, in daily smokers, and in single women. A high intake of AS beverages was associated with preterm delivery; the adjusted OR for those drinking >1 serving/d was 1.11 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.24). Drinking >1 serving of SS beverages per day was also associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery (adjusted OR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.45). The trend tests were positive for both beverage types. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a high intake of both AS and SS beverages is associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery.","Beverages/*adverse effects Carbonated Beverages/adverse effects Cohort Studies Dietary Sucrose/*adverse effects Educational Status Energy Intake Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Norway Obstetric Labor, Premature/*etiology Overweight/complications Pregnancy Prospective Studies Questionnaires Registries Single Person Smoking/adverse effects Sweetening Agents/*adverse effects Thinness/complications"

We prospectively assessed resistance to second-line antituberculosis drugs in eight countries. METHODS: From Jan 1, 2005, to Dec 31, 2008, we enrolled consecutive adults with locally confirmed pulmonary MDR tuberculosis at the start of second-line treatment in Estonia, Latvia, Peru, Philippines, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, and Thailand. Drug-susceptibility testing for study purposes was done centrally at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 11 first-line and second-line drugs. We compared the results with clinical and epidemiological data to identify risk factors for resistance to second-line drugs and XDR tuberculosis. FINDINGS: Among 1278 patients, 43.7% showed resistance to at least one second-line drug, 20.0% to at least one second-line injectable drug, and 12.9% to at least one fluoroquinolone. 6.7% of patients had XDR tuberculosis (range across study sites 0.8-15.2%). Previous treatment with second-line drugs was consistently the strongest risk factor for resistance to these drugs, which increased the risk of XDR tuberculosis by more than four times. Fluoroquinolone resistance and XDR tuberculosis were more frequent in women than in men. Unemployment, alcohol abuse, and smoking were associated with resistance to second-line injectable drugs across countries. Other risk factors differed between drugs and countries. INTERPRETATION: Previous treatment with second-line drugs is a strong, consistent risk factor for resistance to these drugs, including XDR tuberculosis. Representative drug-susceptibility results could guide in-country policies for laboratory capacity and diagnostic strategies.

This study determined the incidence, cause, and outcomes of cardiovascular-related out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in individuals <35 years of age. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective cohort of OHCA in children and young adults from 1980 through 2009 was identified from the King County (Washington) Division of Emergency Medical Services' Cardiac Arrest Database. Incidence was calculated from population census data and causes of arrest determined by review of autopsy reports and all available medical records. A total of 361 cases (26 cases 0-2 years of age, 30 cases 3-13 years of age, 60 cases 14-24 years of age, and 245 cases 25-35 years of age) of OHCA were treated by emergency medical services responders, for an overall incidence of 2.28 per 100 000 person-years (2.1 in those 0-2 years of age, 0.61 in those 3-13 years of age, 1.44 in those 14-24 years of age, and 4.40 in those 25-35 years of age). The most common causes of OHCA were congenital abnormalities in those 0 to 2 years of age (84.0%) and 3 to 13 years of age (21%), presumed primary arrhythmia in those 14 to 24 of age (23.5%), and coronary artery disease in those 25 to 35 years of age (42.9%). The overall survival rate was 26.9% (3.8% in those 0-2 years of age, 40.0% in those 3-13 years of age, 36.7% in those 14-24 years of age, and 27.8% in those 25-35 years of age). Survival increased throughout the study period from 13.0% in 1980 to 1989 to 40.2% in 2000 to 2009 (P<0.001).

DESIGN: Random allocation to intervention or delayed treatment control with 4- and 12-week follow-up assessments. SETTING: Counsellors from the Cannabis Information and Helpline (CIH), an Australian reactive telephone service, delivered the intervention to callers seeking treatment. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 160 participants were recruited by the CIH, with 110 participants completing the final follow-up assessment (69% retention). MEASUREMENTS: Cannabis use, dependence and related problems and other substance use were assessed at baseline and follow-up. FINDINGS: Intervention participants reported greater reductions in dependence symptoms [P < 0.001, d = 0.9 (0.5-1.3)] and related problems [P < 0.001, d = 0.5 (0.1-0.9)] compared with control participants at both follow-up assessments.

22900974,Who can provide effective and safe termination of pregnancy care? A systematic review*.,BJOG,Renner RM and Brahmi D and Kapp N,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Unsafe termination of pregnancy is a major contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality. Task sharing termination of pregnancy services between physicians and mid-level providers, a heterogeneous group of trained healthcare providers, such as nurses, midwives and physician assistants, has become a key strategy to increase access to safe pregnancy termination care. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the evidence to assess whether termination of pregnancy services by nonphysician providers can be performed safely and effectively. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process and other nonindexed citations and POPLINE. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as well as clinical studies, using study designs that compared efficacy, safety and acceptability of termination of pregnancy services by physicians versus other provider groups. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently extracted the data, and we performed a meta-analysis where appropriate using RevMan. Quality assessment of the data used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. MAIN RESULTS: We identified five controlled studies comprising 8908 women undergoing first-trimester surgical termination of pregnancy (one RCT and three prospective cohort studies) and medical termination of pregnancy (one RCT). The mid-level provider group included midwives, nurses, auxiliary nurse midwives and physician assistants trained in termination of pregnancy services. Safety and efficacy outcomes, including incomplete termination of pregnancy, haemorrhage, injury to the uterus or cervix, did not differ significantly between providers. AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence indicates that trained mid-level providers may effectively and safely provide first-trimester surgical and medical termination of pregnancy services. Data are limited by the scarcity of RCTs and biases of the cohort studies.","Abortion, Induced/methods/*standards Delivery of Health Care/*standards Female Humans Midwifery/*standards Nurse Midwives/*standards Physician Assistants/*standards Pregnancy Prenatal Care/*standards Prospective Studies Quality Improvement Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Selection Bias Treatment Outcome"

At the same time, marine n-3 (omega-3) PUFAs are an inherent constituent of fish and are regarded as beneficial. To our knowledge, no risk-benefit model on the basis of data on methylmercury, PUFA, and MI risk has yet been presented. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe how exposure to both marine n-3 PUFAs and methylmercury relates to MI risk by using data from Finland and Sweden. DESIGN: We used matched case-control sets from Sweden and Finland that were nested in population-based, prospective cohort studies. We included 361 men with MI from Sweden and 211 men with MI from Finland. MI risk was estimated in a logistic regression model with the amount of mercury in hair (hair-Hg) and concentrations of n-3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) in serum (S-PUFA) as independent variables. RESULTS: The median hair-Hg was 0.57 mug/g in Swedish and 1.32 mug/g in Finnish control subjects, whereas the percentage of S-PUFA was 4.21% and 3.83%, respectively. In combined analysis, hair-Hg was associated with higher (P = 0.005) and S-PUFA with lower (P = 0.011) MI risk. Our model indicated that even a small change in fish consumption (ie, by increasing S-PUFA by 1%) would prevent 7% of MIs, despite a small increase in mercury exposure. However, at a high hair-Hg, the modeled beneficial effect of PUFA on MI risk was counteracted by methylmercury. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to methylmercury was associated with increased risk of MI, and higher S-PUFA concentrations were associated with decreased risk of MI. Thus, MI risk may be reduced by the consumption of fish high in PUFAs and low in methylmercury.","Adult Aged Animals Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies Fatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*blood Finland *Fishes *Food Contamination Hair/chemistry Humans Logistic Models Male Mercury/analysis Mercury Poisoning/etiology/*physiopathology Methylmercury Compounds/administration & dosage/toxicity Middle Aged Myocardial Infarction/blood/*etiology/metabolism/*prevention & control Prospective Studies Risk Assessment Seafood/*adverse effects Sweden"

We examined whether income disparities in diabetes-related morbidity or mortality decline after age 65 in a setting where much of health care is publicly funded yet universal drug coverage starts only at age 65. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using administrative health claims from Ontario, Canada. Adults with diabetes (N = 606,051) were followed from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2008 for a composite outcome of death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and nonfatal stroke. SES was based on neighborhood median household income levels from the 2001 Canadian Census. RESULTS: SES was a strong predictor of death, nonfatal AMI, or nonfatal stroke among those <65 years of age (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.51 [95% CI 1.45-1.56]) and exerted a lesser effect among those >/=65 years of age (1.12 [1.09-1.14]; P < 0.0001 for interaction), after adjusting for age, sex, baseline cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes duration, comorbidity, and health care utilization.

22879367,Cardiovascular risk of high- versus moderate-intensity aerobic exercise in coronary heart disease patients.,Circulation,Rognmo O and Moholdt T and Bakken H and Hole T and Molstad P and Myhr NE and Grimsmo J and Wisloff U,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Exercise performed at higher relative intensities has been found to elicit a greater increase in aerobic capacity and greater cardioprotective effects than exercise at moderate intensities. An inverse association has also been detected between the relative intensity of physical activity and the risk of developing coronary heart disease, independent of the total volume of physical activity. Despite that higher levels of physical activity are effective in reducing cardiovascular events, it is also advocated that vigorous exercise could acutely and transiently increase the risk of sudden cardiac death and myocardial infarction in susceptible persons. This issue may affect cardiac rehabilitation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the risk of cardiovascular events during organized high-intensity interval exercise training and moderate-intensity training among 4846 patients with coronary heart disease in 3 Norwegian cardiac rehabilitation centers. In a total of 175 820 exercise training hours during which all patients performed both types of training, we found 1 fatal cardiac arrest during moderate-intensity exercise (129 456 exercise hours) and 2 nonfatal cardiac arrests during high-intensity interval exercise (46 364 exercise hours). There were no myocardial infarctions in the data material. Because the number of high-intensity training hours was 36% of the number of moderate-intensity hours, the rates of complications to the number of patient-exercise hours were 1 per 129 456 hours of moderate-intensity exercise and 1 per 23 182 hours of high-intensity exercise. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicate that the risk of a cardiovascular event is low after both high-intensity exercise and moderate-intensity exercise in a cardiovascular rehabilitation setting. Considering the significant cardiovascular adaptations associated with high-intensity exercise, such exercise should be considered among patients with coronary heart disease.","Adaptation, Physiological/physiology Cardiac Surgical Procedures/rehabilitation Coronary Disease/*mortality/physiopathology/*rehabilitation/surgery Death, Sudden, Cardiac/*epidemiology Exercise/*physiology Exercise Therapy/*adverse effects/*methods/statistics & numerical data Female Health Surveys Heart Failure/mortality/physiopathology/rehabilitation/surgery Heart Valve Diseases/mortality/physiopathology/rehabilitation/surgery Humans Male Middle Aged Myocardial Infarction/mortality/physiopathology/rehabilitation Norway/epidemiology Risk Factors"
22863259,Secondhand tobacco smoke exposure and severity of influenza in hospitalized children.,J Pediatr,Wilson KM and Pier JC and Wesgate SC and Cohen JM and Blumkin AK,childrenscolorado,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether children with influenza who are exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) would have more severe illness than those not exposed. STUDY DESIGN: We abstracted charts from pediatric inpatients with confirmed influenza from 2002-2009 for demographics, medical history, and smoke exposure. Severity indicators included intensive care, intubation, and length of stay (LOS) in the hospital; potential confounding factors included demographics and the presence of asthma or chronic conditions. All chi(2), t tests, and regression analyses were run using SPSS v. 18.0. RESULTS: Of 117 children, 40% were exposed to SHS, who had increased need for intensive care (30% vs 10%, P < .01) and intubation (13% vs 1%, P < .05), and had longer LOS (4.0 vs 2.4 days, P < .01). Children with chronic conditions and SHS exposure required more intensive care (53% vs 18%, P < .05) and had longer LOS (10.0 vs 3.5 days, P < .01) than children not exposed to SHS with chronic conditions. In multivariate analyses controlling for potential confounding factors, children with SHS exposure were 4.7 times more likely to be admitted to intensive care (95% CI 1.4-18.5) and had a 70% longer LOS (95% CI 12%-230%). CONCLUSIONS: Children with SHS exposure who are hospitalized with influenza have more severe illness. Efforts are needed to immunize this population against influenza, and eliminate children's exposure to SHS.","Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Female Hospitalization Humans Infant Influenza, Human/*complications Male Retrospective Studies Severity of Illness Index Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects"

DESIGN: National birth cohort study. SETTING: USA. POPULATION AND SAMPLE: Singleton live births, with primary analysis based on non-Hispanic white women. METHODS: Ecological study based on the 50 states and the District of Columbia during two time periods 10 years apart: 1992-94 and 2002-04. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Preterm birth (live birth <37 completed weeks of gestation), based on an algorithm combining menstrual and clinical estimates of gestational age. RESULTS: The state-level ecological analysis among non-Hispanic white women showed that the change in preterm birth rate from 1992-94 to 2002-04 was significantly associated with the change in rate of labour induction (r = 0.50, 95% CI 0.26-0.68), but not with the change in rate of caesarean delivery (r = -0.06, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.22). Weaker but otherwise similar associations with labour induction were observed in Hispanic women and in non-Hispanic black women. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing use of labour induction is probably an important cause of the observed increased rate in preterm birth.","Adult Algorithms Cesarean Section/*adverse effects Cohort Studies European Continental Ancestry Group Female Gestational Age Humans Labor, Induced/*adverse effects Pregnancy Premature Birth/*epidemiology/etiology Risk Factors United States/epidemiology Young Adult"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified days when 2 procedures of the same type were performed by the same surgeon, including 72 laparoscopic and 340 robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomies, and 110 percutaneous nephrolithotomies. Clinical data and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: For percutaneous nephrolithotomy multiple access (16% vs 9%, p = 0.2), transfusion (3.6% vs 5.4%, p = 0.5), complication (20% vs 18%, p = 0.5), residual fragment (53% vs 45%, p = 0.3), second look (38% vs 35% p = 0.4) and stone-free (86% vs 89% p = 0.3) rates did not differ for the first and second procedures. For laparoscopic prostatectomy nerve sparing (100% vs 97.1%, p = 0.5), operative complications (0% vs 0%, p = 0.7), drain requirement (36% vs 42%, p = 0.6) and lymphadenectomy (13.5% vs 25.7%, p = 0.16) rates were comparable. Positive margins (19.4% vs 36.1% p = 0.08), continence (66.7% vs 66.7%, p = 0.9), potency (58.3% vs 52.8%, p = 0.76) and prostate specific antigen recurrence (10.8% vs 20%, p = 0.45) did not significantly differ for the first and second procedures. For robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy operative complications (3% vs 3.5%, p = 0.8), drain requirement (7.7% vs 9.8%, p = 0.5), positive margins (41.7% vs 39.3%, p = 0.37), continence (78.6% vs 84.4%, p = 0.12), potency (51% vs 50%, p = 0.15) and prostate specific antigen recurrence (9.5% vs 11.6%, p = 0.2) did not significantly differ. Nerve sparing was more common in the second case cohort (86.9% vs 75.7%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Despite concern that surgeon fatigue may impact outcomes, our data suggests that performing several complex urological procedures consecutively is not associated with worse outcomes.","Fatigue/*epidemiology Female Humans Laparoscopy/*standards/*statistics & numerical data Male Middle Aged Nephrostomy, Percutaneous/*standards/*statistics & numerical data Prostatectomy/methods/*standards/*statistics & numerical data Retrospective Studies Robotics/*statistics & numerical data *Task Performance and Analysis Treatment Outcome *Urology"

DESIGN: Prospective cohort survey. SETTING: United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 7436 adult smokers (18+ years) selected via random digit dialling and interviewed as part of the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey (ITC-4) between 2002 and 2009. Primary analyses utilized the subset of respondents who participated in 2006 or later (n = 2550). MEASUREMENTS: Continuous abstinence from smoking for 1 month/6 months. FINDINGS: Among participants who recalled making a quit attempt within 1 month of interview, those who reported using varenicline, bupropion or nicotine patch were more likely to maintain 6-month continuous abstinence from smoking compared to those who attempted to quit without medication [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 5.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) (2.12-16.12), 3.94 (0.87-17.80), 4.09 (1.72-9.74), respectively]; there were no clear effects for oral NRT use. Those who did not use any medication when attempting to quit tended to be younger, to be racial/ethnic minorities, to have lower incomes and to believe that medications do not make quitting easier. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with evidence from randomized controlled trials, smokers in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and the United States are more likely to succeed in quit attempts if they use varenicline, bupropion or nicotine patch.

22944872,"Effect of nonpayment for hospital-acquired, catheter-associated urinary tract infection: a statewide analysis.",Ann Intern Med,Meddings JA and Reichert H and Rogers MA and Saint S and Stephansky J and McMahon LF,umich,"BACKGROUND: Most (59% to 86%) hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) are catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). As of 2008, claims data are used to deny payment for certain hospital-acquired conditions, including CAUTIs, and publicly report hospital performance. OBJECTIVE: To examine rates of UTIs in adults that are coded in claims data as hospital-acquired and catheter-associated events and evaluate how often nonpayment for CAUTI lowers hospital payment. DESIGN: Before-and-after study of all-payer cross-sectional claims data. SETTING: 96 nonfederal acute care Michigan hospitals. PATIENTS: Nonobstetric adults discharged in 2007 (n = 767 531) and 2009 (n = 781 343). MEASUREMENTS: Hospital rates of UTIs (categorized as catheter-associated or hospital-acquired) and frequency of reduced payment for hospital-acquired CAUTIs. RESULTS: Hospitals frequently requested payment for non-CAUTIs as secondary diagnoses: 10.0% (95% CI, 9.5% to 10.5%) of discharges in 2007 and 10.3% (CI, 9.8% to 10.9%) in 2009. Hospital rates of CAUTI were very low: 0.09% (CI, 0.06% to 0.12%) in 2007 and 0.14% (CI, 0.11% to 0.17%) in 2009. In 2009, 2.6% (CI, 1.6% to 3.6%) of hospital-acquired UTIs were described as CAUTIs. Nonpayment for hospital-acquired CAUTIs reduced payment for 25 of 781 343 (0.003%) hospitalizations in 2009. LIMITATIONS: Data are from only 1 state and involved only 1 year before and after nonpayment for complications. Hospital prevention practices were not examined. CONCLUSION: Catheter-associated UTI rates determined by claims data seem to be inaccurate and are much lower than expected from epidemiologic surveillance data. The financial impact of current nonpayment policy for hospital-acquired CAUTI is low. Claims data are currently not valid data sets for comparing hospital-acquired CAUTI rates for the purpose of public reporting or imposing financial incentives or penalties.

22945282,Perfluorooctanoic acid and cardiovascular disease in US adults.,Arch Intern Med,Shankar A and Xiao J and Ducatman A,wvu,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health problem. Identifying novel risk factors for CVD, including widely prevalent environmental exposures, is therefore important. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a manmade chemical used in the manufacture of common household consumer products. Biomonitoring surveys have shown that PFOA is detectable in the blood of more than 98% of the US population. Experimental animal studies suggest that an association between PFOA and CVD is plausible. However, this association in humans has not been previously examined. We therefore examined the independent relationship between serum PFOA levels and CVD outcomes in a representative sample of Americans. METHODS: We examined 1216 subjects (51.2% women) from the 1999-2003 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey. Serum PFOA levels were examined in quartiles. The main outcomes of interest were self-reported CVD, including coronary heart disease and stroke, and objectively measured peripheral arterial disease (PAD), defined as an ankle-brachial blood pressure index of less than 0.9. RESULTS: We found that increasing serum PFOA levels are positively associated with CVD and PAD, independent of confounders such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and serum cholesterol level. Compared with quartile 1 (reference) of PFOA level, the multivariable odds ratio (95% CI) among subjects in quartile 4 was 2.01 (1.12-3.60; P = .01 for trend) for CVD and 1.78 (1.03-3.08; P = .04 for trend) for PAD.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2934 adults aged 40 years or older who participated in the examination component of the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey. METHODS: Frequency-doubling technology (FDT) testing was performed in both eyes and used to categorize subjects as having no VF loss, unilateral VF loss, or bilateral VF loss. Accelerometer data were collected over 7 days of normal activity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Steps per day and daily minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity (MVPA). RESULTS: A total of 1468 participants (50.0%) had complete FDT and accelerometer data. Individuals without VF loss averaged 9751 steps/day and 20.8 minutes/day of MVPA, compared with 8023 steps/day and 14.5 minutes/day for subjects with unilateral VF loss (age-adjusted P = 0.11 and P = 0.51) and 6840 steps/day and 10.1 minutes/day for subjects with bilateral VF loss (age-adjusted P = 0.02 and 0.09, respectively). In multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and several comorbid illnesses, individuals with bilateral VF loss took 17% fewer steps per day (P < 0.01) and engaged in 30% less MVPA (P = 0.02) than individuals without VF loss. No significant difference in steps per day or MVPA was observed between individuals with unilateral VF loss and no VF loss (P > 0.05). In addition to VF loss, older age, female sex, arthritis, diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), and stroke were significantly associated with fewer daily steps and minutes of MVPA (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral VF loss is associated with less walking and physical activity in American adults. Patients with bilateral VF loss should be encouraged to engage safely in more physical activity.

However, prospective data on the association are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study among 19,162 participants in the Women's Health Study who had a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5- <25 kg/m(2) at baseline. Migraine was self-reported by standardized questionnaires. Main outcome measures were incident overweight (BMI >/= 25 kg/m(2)), incident obesity (BMI >/= 30 kg/m(2)) and mean weight change. Age- and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for the association between migraine and incident overweight and obesity. Differences in weight change were evaluated by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). RESULTS: A total of 3,483 (18.2%) women reported any migraine history. After 12.9 years of follow-up, 7916 incident overweight and 730 incident obesity cases occurred. Migraineurs had multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% confidence interval) of 1.11 (1.05-1.17) for becoming overweight and 1.00 (0.83-1.19) for becoming obese. These associations remained stable after censoring for chronic diseases and were similar according to migraine aura status. Multivariable-adjusted mean weight change from baseline to the end of study was +4.7 kg for migraineurs and +4.4 kg for women without migraine (p = 0.02).

We determined whether implementation of a centralized prescription network offering real-time access to patient-level data on filled prescriptions (PharmaNet) reduced the number of potentially inappropriate prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines. METHODS: We conducted a time series analysis using prescription records between Jan. 1, 1993, and Dec. 31, 1997, for residents of the province of British Columbia who were receiving social assistance or were 65 years or older. We calculated monthly percentages of filled prescriptions for an opioid or a benzodiazepine that were deemed inappropriate (those issued by a different physician and dispensed at a different pharmacy within 7 days after a filled prescription of at least 30 tablets of the same drug). RESULTS: Within 6 months after implementation of PharmaNet in July 1995, we observed a relative reduction in inappropriate filled prescriptions for opioids of 32.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31.0%-34.7%) among patients receiving social assistance; inappropriate filled prescriptions for benzodiazepines decreased by 48.6% (95% CI 43.2%-53.1%).

We aimed to assess efficacy of long-term use of standardised ginkgo biloba extract for the reduction of incidence of Alzheimer's disease in elderly adults with memory complaints. METHODS: In the randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled GuidAge clinical trial, we enrolled adults aged 70 years or older who spontaneously reported memory complaints to their primary-care physician in France. We randomly allocated participants in a 1:1 ratio according to a computer-generated sequence to a twice per day dose of 120 mg standardised ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) or matched placebo. Participants and study investigators and personnel were masked to study group assignment. Participants were followed-up for 5 years by primary-care physicians and in expert memory centres. The primary outcome was conversion to probable Alzheimer's disease in participants who received at least one dose of study drug or placebo, compared by use of the log-rank test. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00276510. FINDINGS: Between March, 2002, and November, 2004, we enrolled and randomly allocated 2854 participants, of whom 1406 received at least one dose of ginkgo biloba extract and 1414 received at least one dose of placebo. By 5 years, 61 participants in the ginkgo group had been diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease (1.2 cases per 100 person-years) compared with 73 participants in the placebo group (1.4 cases per 100 person-years; hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.60-1.18; p=0.306), but the risk was not proportional over time.

We determined the effectiveness of cranberry juice for the prevention of urinary tract infections in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 children were randomized to receive daily cranberry juice with high concentrations of proanthocyanidin vs cranberry juice with no proanthocyanidin for a 1-year period. The study was powered to detect a 30% decrease in the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infection with type I and II errors of 0.05 and 0.2, respectively. Toilet trained children up to age 18 years were eligible if they had at least 2 culture documented nonfebrile urinary tract infections in the calendar year before enrollment. Patients with anatomical abnormalities (except for primary vesicoureteral reflux) were excluded from study. Subjects were followed for 12 months. The participants, clinicians, outcome assessor and statistician were all blinded to treatment allocation. RESULTS: Of the children 39 girls and 1 boy were recruited. Mean and median patient age was 9.5 and 7 years, respectively (range 5 to 18). There were 20 patients with comparable baseline characteristics randomized to each group. After 12 months of followup the average incidence of urinary tract infection in the treatment group was 0.4 per patient per year and 1.15 in the placebo group (p = 0.045), representing a 65% reduction in the risk of urinary tract infection. CONCLUSIONS: Cranberry juice with high concentrations of proanthocyanidin appears to be effective in the prevention of pediatric nonfebrile urinary tract infections.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial of diabetes genetic risk counseling among overweight patients at increased phenotypic risk for type 2 diabetes. Participants were randomly allocated to genetic testing versus no testing. Genetic risk was calculated by summing 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes. Participants in the top and bottom score quartiles received individual genetic counseling before being enrolled with untested control participants in a 12-week, validated, diabetes prevention program. Middle-risk quartile participants were not studied further. We examined the effect of this genetic counseling intervention on patient self-reported attitudes, program attendance, and weight loss, separately comparing higher-risk and lower-risk result recipients with control participants. RESULTS: The 108 participants enrolled in the diabetes prevention program included 42 participants at higher diabetes genetic risk, 32 at lower diabetes genetic risk, and 34 untested control subjects. Mean age was 57.9 +/- 10.6 years, 61% were men, and average BMI was 34.8 kg/m(2), with no differences among randomization groups. Participants attended 6.8 +/- 4.3 group sessions and lost 8.5 +/- 10.1 pounds, with 33 of 108 (30.6%) losing >/=5% body weight. There were few statistically significant differences in self-reported motivation, program attendance, or mean weight loss when higher-risk recipients and lower-risk recipients were compared with control subjects (P > 0.05 for all but one comparison).

RESULTS: Incident diabetes was identified in 196 of 1,354 (14%) Europeans, 282 of 839 (34%) Indian Asians, and 100 of 335 (30%) African Caribbeans. All Indian Asians and African Caribbeans were first-generation migrants. Compared with Europeans, age-adjusted subhazard ratios (SHRs [95% CI]) for men and women, respectively, were 2.88 (95%, 2.36-3.53; P < 0.001) and 1.91 (1.18-3.10; P = 0.008) in Indian Asians, and 2.23 (1.64-3.03; P < 0.001) and 2.51 (1.63-3.87; P < 0.001) in African Caribbeans. Differences in baseline insulin resistance and truncal obesity largely attenuated the ethnic minority excess in women (adjusted SHRs: Indian Asians 0.77 [0.49-1.42]; P = 0.3; African Caribbeans 1.48 [0.89-2.45]; P = 0.13), but not in men (adjusted SHRs: Indian Asians 1.98 [1.52-2.58]; P < 0.001 and African Caribbeans, 2.05 [1.46-2.89; P < 0.001]). CONCLUSIONS: Insulin resistance and truncal obesity account for the twofold excess incidence of diabetes in Indian Asian and African Caribbean women, but not men. Explanations for the excess diabetes risk in ethnic minority men remains unclear. Further study requires more precise measures of conventional risk factors and identification of novel risk factors.","Adult African Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Aged Asian Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*epidemiology Female Humans Insulin Resistance/*physiology Male Middle Aged Obesity, Abdominal/*physiopathology"
22965656,Population-based case-control study of recreational drug use and testis cancer risk confirms an association between marijuana use and nonseminoma risk.,Cancer,Lacson JC and Carroll JD and Tuazon E and Castelao EJ and Bernstein L and Cortessis VK,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) incidence increased steadily in recent decades, but causes remain elusive. Germ cell function may be influenced by cannabinoids, and 2 prior epidemiologic studies reported that the use of marijuana may be associated with nonseminomatous TGCT. Here, the authors evaluate the relation between TGCTs and exposure to marijuana and other recreational drugs using a population-based case-control study. METHODS: In total, 163 patients who were diagnosed with TGCT in Los Angeles County from December 1986 to April 1991 were enrolled, and 292 controls were matched on age, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood. Participants were asked about drug use by a structured, in-person interview. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for history of cryptorchidism; education; religiosity; and reported use of marijuana, cocaine, and amyl nitrite. RESULTS: Compared with never use, ever use of marijuana had a 2-fold increased risk (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.02-3.68), whereas ever use of cocaine had a negative association with TGCT (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91). Stratification on tumor histology revealed a specific association of marijuana use with nonseminoma and mixed histology tumors (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.08-5.42). CONCLUSIONS: A specific association was observed between marijuana use and the risk of nonseminoma and mixed tumors. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a negative association between cocaine use and TGCT risk. The current results warrant mechanistic studies of marijuana's effect on the endocannabinoid system and TGCT risk and caution that recreational and therapeutic use of cannabinoids by young men may confer malignant potential to testicular germ cells.","Adolescent Adult Case-Control Studies Humans Male Marijuana Smoking/*adverse effects Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/*epidemiology Risk Factors Testicular Neoplasms/epidemiology Young Adult"

We investigated the efficacy of a recombinant, live, attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine. METHODS: In this observer-masked, randomised, controlled, monocentre, phase 2b, proof-of-concept trial, healthy Thai schoolchildren aged 4-11 years were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive three injections of dengue vaccine or control (rabies vaccine or placebo) at months 0, 6, and 12. Randomisation was by computer-generated permuted blocks of six and participants were assigned with an interactive response system. Participants were actively followed up until month 25. All acute febrile illnesses were investigated. Dengue viraemia was confirmed by serotype-specific RT-PCR and non-structural protein 1 ELISA. The primary objective was to assess protective efficacy against virologically confirmed, symptomatic dengue, irrespective of severity or serotype, occurring 1 month or longer after the third injection (per-protocol analysis). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00842530. FINDINGS: 4002 participants were assigned to vaccine (n=2669) or control (n=1333). 3673 were included in the primary analysis (2452 vaccine, 1221 control). 134 cases of virologically confirmed dengue occurred during the study. Efficacy was 30.2% (95% CI -13.4 to 56.6), and differed by serotype. Dengue vaccine was well tolerated, with no safety signals after 2 years of follow-up after the first dose. INTERPRETATION: These data show for the first time that a safe vaccine against dengue is possible. Ongoing large-scale phase 3 studies in various epidemiological settings will provide pivotal data for the CYD dengue vaccine candidate.

METHODS: The 2006 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) was analyzed. Medical errors were defined by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Medical error rates per 100 hospital discharges and per 1000 inpatient days were calculated. Logistic regression models were fitted to study the association between number of chronic conditions and medical errors, controlling for patient characteristics, hospital characteristics, disease severity, and length of stay. RESULTS: In the 2006 KID, 22.3% of pediatric inpatients had 1 chronic condition, 9.8% had 2 chronic conditions, and 12.0% had >/= 3 chronic conditions. The overall medical error rate per 100 discharges was 3.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.8-3.3); it was 5.3 (95% CI: 4.9-5.7) in children with chronic conditions and 1.3 (95% CI: 1.2-1.3) in children without chronic conditions. The medical error rate per 1000 inpatient days was also higher in children with chronic conditions. The association between chronic conditions and medical errors remained statistically significant in logistic regression models adjusting for patient characteristics, hospital characteristics, disease severity, and length of stay. In the adjusted model, the odds ratio of medical errors for children with 1 chronic condition was 1.40 (95% CI: 1.32-1.48); for children with 2 conditions, the OR was 1.55 (95% CI: 1.45-1.66); and for children with 3 conditions, the OR was 1.66 (95% CI: 1.53-1.81). CONCLUSIONS: The number of chronic conditions was significantly associated with iatrogenic medical errors in pediatric inpatients.","Adolescent Child Child, Preschool *Chronic Disease Databases, Factual Female *Hospitalization Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Length of Stay Logistic Models Male Medical Errors/*statistics & numerical data Odds Ratio Risk Factors Severity of Illness Index United States"
22964778,Interventions to improve adherence to self-administered medications for chronic diseases in the United States: a systematic review.,Ann Intern Med,Viswanathan M and Golin CE and Jones CD and Ashok M and Blalock SJ and Wines RC and Coker-Schwimmer EJ and Rosen DL and Sista P and Lohr KN,rti,"BACKGROUND: Suboptimum medication adherence is common in the United States and leads to serious negative health consequences but may respond to intervention. PURPOSE: To assess the comparative effectiveness of patient, provider, systems, and policy interventions that aim to improve medication adherence for chronic health conditions in the United States. DATA SOURCES: Eligible peer-reviewed publications from MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library indexed through 4 June 2012 and additional studies from reference lists and technical experts. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, controlled trials of patient, provider, or systems interventions to improve adherence to long-term medications and nonrandomized studies of policy interventions to improve medication adherence. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently selected, extracted data from, and rated the risk of bias of relevant studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: The evidence was synthesized separately for each clinical condition; within each condition, the type of intervention was synthesized. Two reviewers graded the strength of evidence by using established criteria. From 4124 eligible abstracts, 62 trials of patient-, provider-, or systems-level interventions evaluated 18 types of interventions; another 4 observational studies and 1 trial of policy interventions evaluated the effect of reduced medication copayments or improved prescription drug coverage. Clinical conditions amenable to multiple approaches to improving adherence include hypertension, heart failure, depression, and asthma. Interventions that improve adherence across multiple clinical conditions include policy interventions to reduce copayments or improve prescription drug coverage, systems interventions to offer case management, and patient-level educational interventions with behavioral support. LIMITATIONS: Studies were limited to adults with chronic conditions (excluding HIV, AIDS, severe mental illness, and substance abuse) in the United States. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity hindered quantitative data pooling. CONCLUSION: Reduced out-of-pocket expenses, case management, and patient education with behavioral support all improved medication adherence for more than 1 condition. Evidence is limited on whether these approaches are broadly applicable or affect longterm medication adherence and health outcomes.

22944484,"Peanut allergy diagnoses among children residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota.",J Allergy Clin Immunol,Rinaldi M and Harnack L and Oberg C and Schreiner P and St Sauver J and Travis LL,umn,"BACKGROUND: Peanut allergy is a major health concern, particularly in developed countries. Research indicates that as many as 2% of children are allergic to peanuts, which represents a 3-fold increase in diagnoses over the past 2 decades. OBJECTIVE: This population-based descriptive study used the Rochester Epidemiology Project to estimate the prevalence in 2007 and annual incidence rates of peanut allergy diagnoses from 1999 to 2007 among children residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota. METHODS: Residents of Olmsted County from January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2007, who received medical care at a Rochester Epidemiology Project facility and provided research authorization were eligible for the study. A medical chart review of 547 potential diagnoses resulted in 244 prevalent and 170 incident cases. Annual rates, crude and adjusted for age and sex, were standardized with the use of the indirect method to the Olmsted County population data in 1999. Incidence rate ratios were estimated with Poisson regression. RESULTS: The prevalence in 2007 was 0.65%. Female children were less likely to be diagnosed than male children (incidence rate ratio = 0.18; 95% CI, 0.07-0.48). Children aged birth to 2 years were significantly more likely to be diagnosed than older children aged 3-17 years (incidence rate ratio = 0.001; 95% CI, 0.0004-0.004). A significant 3-fold increasing trend was observed in diagnoses over time from 2.05 cases per 10,000 children in 1999 to 6.88 cases per 10,000 in 2007. CONCLUSIONS: Peanut allergies are an increasing concern in Olmsted County, Minnesota, as indicated by a 3-fold increase in diagnoses from 2.05 per 10,000 children in 1999 to 6.88 per 10,000 children in 2007.","Adolescent Age Factors Child Child, Preschool Female Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Male Minnesota/epidemiology Multivariate Analysis Peanut Hypersensitivity/*epidemiology Prevalence Time Factors"

GSK598809 is a selective D(3)R antagonist recently progressed in Phase I trials. The aim of this study was to establish a model, based on the determination of the occupancy of brain D(3)Rs (O(D(3))(R)) across species, to predict the ability of GSK598809 to reduce nicotine-seeking behavior in humans, here assessed as cigarette craving in smokers. Using ex vivo [(125)I](R)-trans-7-hydroxy-2-[N-propyl-N-(3'-iodo-2'-propenyl)amino] tetralin ([(125)I]7OH-PIPAT) autoradiography and [(11)C]PHNO positron emission tomography, we demonstrated a dose-dependent occupancy of the D(3)Rs by GSK598809 in rat, baboon, and human brains. We also showed a direct relationship between O(D(3))(R) and pharmacokinetic exposure, and potencies in line with the in vitro binding affinity. Likewise, GSK598809 dose dependently reduced the expression of nicotine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats, with an effect proportional to the exposure and O(D(3))(R) at every time point, and 100% effect at O(D(3))(R) values >/=72%. In humans, a single dose of GSK598809, giving submaximal levels (72-89%) of O(D(3))(R), transiently alleviated craving in smokers after overnight abstinence. These data suggest that either higher O(D(3))(R) is required for a full effect in humans or that nicotine-seeking behavior in CPP rats only partially translates into craving for cigarettes in short-term abstinent smokers. In addition, they provide the first clinical evidence of potential efficacy of a selective D(3)R antagonist for the treatment of substance-use disorders.","Adult Animals CHO Cells Cricetinae Cricetulus Dopamine Antagonists/pharmacology/therapeutic use Drug-Seeking Behavior/*drug effects/*physiology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Models, Neurological Papio anubis Protein Binding/physiology Rats Receptors, Dopamine D3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism Smoking/*drug therapy/*metabolism Smoking Cessation/methods Translational Medical Research/*methods"

The current investigation interrogated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of individuals with ASD from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) database. SNPs were mapped to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)-derived pathways to identify affected cellular processes and develop a diagnostic test. This test was then applied to two independent samples from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) and Wellcome Trust 1958 normal birth cohort (WTBC) for validation. Using AGRE SNP data from a Central European (CEU) cohort, we created a genetic diagnostic classifier consisting of 237 SNPs in 146 genes that correctly predicted ASD diagnosis in 85.6% of CEU cases. This classifier also predicted 84.3% of cases in an ethnically related Tuscan cohort; however, prediction was less accurate (56.4%) in a genetically dissimilar Han Chinese cohort (HAN). Eight SNPs in three genes (KCNMB4, GNAO1, GRM5) had the largest effect in the classifier with some acting as vulnerability SNPs, whereas others were protective. Prediction accuracy diminished as the number of SNPs analyzed in the model was decreased. Our diagnostic classifier correctly predicted ASD diagnosis with an accuracy of 71.7% in CEU individuals from the SFARI (ASD) and WTBC (controls) validation data sets. In conclusion, we have developed an accurate diagnostic test for a genetically homogeneous group to aid in early detection of ASD. While SNPs differ across ethnic groups, our pathway approach identified cellular processes common to ASD across ethnicities. Our results have wide implications for detection, intervention and prevention of ASD.",Missing

Of all the forms of deafness, auditory neuropathy is of particular concern. This condition, defined primarily by damage to the SGNs with relative preservation of the hair cells, is responsible for a substantial proportion of patients with hearing impairment. Although the loss of hair cells can be circumvented partially by a cochlear implant, no routine treatment is available for sensory neuron loss, as poor innervation limits the prospective performance of an implant. Using stem cells to recover the damaged sensory circuitry is a potential therapeutic strategy. Here we present a protocol to induce differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) using signals involved in the initial specification of the otic placode. We obtained two types of otic progenitors able to differentiate in vitro into hair-cell-like cells and auditory neurons that display expected electrophysiological properties. Moreover, when transplanted into an auditory neuropathy model, otic neuroprogenitors engraft, differentiate and significantly improve auditory-evoked response thresholds. These results should stimulate further research into the development of a cell-based therapy for deafness.","Animals Auditory Threshold *Cell Differentiation Cell Line Cells, Cultured Cochlear Nerve/cytology/physiology Deafness/chemically induced/therapy Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology *Evoked Potentials, Auditory Fibroblast Growth Factor 10/genetics/metabolism Fibroblast Growth Factor 3/genetics/metabolism Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental Gerbillinae Hair Cells, Auditory/cytology/physiology Humans Mice Patch-Clamp Techniques Stem Cell Transplantation Stem Cells/*cytology"

There are few data on the extent to which food insecurity impacts patterns of health-care utilization among HIV-infected individuals. OBJECTIVE: We examined whether food insecurity was associated with hospitalizations, Emergency Department (ED) visits, and non-ED outpatient visits. METHODS: HIV-infected, homeless and marginally housed individuals participating in the San Francisco Research on Access to Care in the Homeless (REACH) cohort underwent quarterly structured interviews and blood draws. We measured food insecurity with the validated Household Food Insecurity Access Scale, and categorized participants as food secure, mild/moderately food insecure, and severely food insecure. Primary outcomes were: (1) any hospitalizations, (2) any ED visits, and (3) any non-ED outpatient visits. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate model parameters, adjusting for socio-demographic (age, sex, ethnicity, education, income, housing status, health insurance) and clinical variables (CD4 nadir, time on antiretroviral therapy, depression, and illicit drug use). RESULTS: Beginning in November 2007, 347 persons were followed for a median of 2 years. Fifty-six percent of participants were food insecure at enrollment. Compared with food-secure persons, those with severe food insecurity had increased odds of hospitalizations [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.16, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.50-3.09] and ED visits (AOR = 1.71, 95 % CI = 1.06-2.30). While the odds of an outpatient visit were 41 % higher for severely food insecure individuals, the effect was not statistically significant (AOR = 1.41, 95 % CI = 0.99-2.01). Mild/moderate food insecurity was also associated with increased hospitalizations (AOR = 1.56, 95 % CI = 1.06-2.30), ED visits (AOR = 1.57, 95 % CI = 1.22-2.03), and outpatient visits (AOR = 1.68, 95 % CI = 1.20-2.17). CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity is associated with increased health services utilization among homeless and marginally housed HIV-infected individuals in San Francisco. Increased ED visits and hospitalizations are not related to fewer ambulatory care visits among food-insecure individuals. Addressing food insecurity should be a critical component of HIV treatment programs and may reduce reliance on acute care utilization.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over California Emergency Service, Hospital/utilization Female Food Supply/*statistics & numerical data HIV Infections/*therapy Health Services/*utilization Health Services Research/methods Homeless Persons/*statistics & numerical data Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data Housing/*statistics & numerical data Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Middle Aged Outpatient Clinics, Hospital/utilization"
22966101,Extended office hours and health care expenditures: a national study.,Ann Fam Med,Jerant A and Bertakis KD and Fenton JJ and Franks P,ucdavis,"PURPOSE: A key component of primary care improvement efforts is timely access to care; however, little is known regarding the effects of extended (evening and weekend) office hours on health care use and outcomes. We examined the association between reported access to extended office hours and both health care expenditures and mortality. METHODS: We analyzed data from individuals aged 18 to 90 years responding to the 2000-2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys reporting access or no access to extended hours via a usual source of care in 2 successive years (year 1 and year 2; N = 30,714). Dependent variables were year 2 total health care expenditures and, for those enrolled in 2000-2005, all-cause mortality through 2006. Covariates were year 1 sociodemographics and health care use, and year 2 health insurance, health status, and chronic conditions. We conducted further analyses, progressively adjusting for year 2 use, to explore mechanisms. RESULTS: Total expenditures were 10.4% lower (95% confidence interval, 7.2%-13.4%) among patients reporting access to extended hours in both years vs neither year. Adjustment for year 2 prescription drug expenditures, and to a lesser extent, office visit-related expenditures (but not total prescriptions or office visits, or emergency and inpatient expenditures) attenuated this relationship. Extended-hours access was not statistically associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents reporting a usual source of care offering evening and weekend office hours had lower total health care expenditures than those without extended-hours access, an association related to lower prescription drug and office visit-related (eg, testing) expenditures, without adverse effects on mortality. Although requiring further study, extended office hours may be associated with more judicious use of health care resources.","Adolescent Adult After-Hours Care/*economics/statistics & numerical data Aged Aged, 80 and over Emergency Medical Services/utilization Female Health Expenditures/*statistics & numerical data Health Services/utilization Health Services Accessibility/*economics/statistics & numerical data Health Status Humans Linear Models Male Middle Aged Mortality/*trends Office Visits/economics/statistics & numerical data Prescription Drugs/economics Primary Health Care/*economics/statistics & numerical data Questionnaires United States"
22954897,Sun protection counseling by pediatricians has little effect on parent and child sun protection behavior.,J Pediatr,Cohen L and Brown J and Haukness H and Walsh L and Robinson JK,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To compare counseling concerning sun protection and outdoor exercise with the parent's report of the behavior of a child aged 9-16 years old. STUDY DESIGN: Structured interviews of medical personnel in 3 Chicago area practices elicited information about counseling methods and recommendations. In each practice, a convenience sample of parents completed a self-reported survey of their and their child's behavior. RESULTS: Sun protection counseling occurred more frequently than exercise counseling in all practices (P = .014). Sun protection counseling was associated with parental prompting (P = .004), performing a summer camp physical (P = .002), and the child having a sunburn (P = .003). After controlling for the child's age, sex, and skin tone, sun protection counseling was not associated with the child's use of sun protection. In multivariate analysis of the child's sun protection behavior, parental sunburns, indoor tanning in the last 12 months, perception of skin cancer risk, and sun protection self-efficacy were significant (P = .02). Children who pursued outdoor sports were twice as likely to use inadequate sun protection and sustain sunburns (CI 1.3-1.7). CONCLUSIONS: The child's sun protection behavior was influenced by parental sun protection, parental perception of skin cancer risk, and parental sun protection self-efficacy; therefore, sun protection for children needs to be aimed at parents as well as children. Communication with parents in a way that incorporates the principles of motivational interviewing may be more effective in promoting behavioral change than admonitions to use sunscreen.",Adolescent Child *Directive Counseling *Exercise Female *Health Behavior Humans Male *Parents *Pediatrics Sunburn/*prevention & control *Sunscreening Agents
22972806,Summary of the evidence of breast cancer service screening outcomes in Europe and first estimate of the benefit and harm balance sheet.,J Med Screen,Paci E,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To construct a European 'balance sheet' of key outcomes of population-based mammographic breast cancer screening, to inform policy-makers, stakeholders and invited women. METHODS: From the studies reviewed, the primary benefit of screening, breast cancer mortality reduction, was compared with the main harms, over-diagnosis and false-positive screening results (FPRs). RESULTS: Pooled estimates of breast cancer mortality reduction among invited women were 25% in incidence-based mortality studies and 31% in case-control studies (38% and 48% among women actually screened). Estimates of over-diagnosis ranged from 1% to 10% of the expected incidence in the absence of screening. The combined estimate of over-diagnosis for screened women, from European studies correctly adjusted for lead time and underlying trend, was 6.5%. For women undergoing 10 biennial screening tests, the estimated cumulative risk of a FPR followed by non-invasive assessment was 17%, and 3% having an invasive assessment. For every 1000 women screened biennially from age 50-51 until age 68-69 and followed up to age 79, an estimated seven to nine lives are saved, four cases are over-diagnosed, 170 women have at least one recall followed by non-invasive assessment with a negative result and 30 women have at least one recall followed by invasive procedures yielding a negative result. CONCLUSIONS: The chance of saving a woman's life by population-based mammographic screening of appropriate quality is greater than that of over-diagnosis. Service screening in Europe achieves a mortality benefit at least as great as the randomized controlled trials. These outcomes should be communicated to women offered service screening in Europe.",Aged Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis Early Detection of Cancer Europe Female Humans Mammography Middle Aged

OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between health literacy and both outcomes and health status in COPD. PARTICIPANTS, DESIGN AND MAIN MEASURES: Structured interviews were administered to 277 subjects with self-report of physician-diagnosed COPD, recruited through US random-digit telephone dialing. Health literacy was measured with a validated three-item battery. Multivariable linear regression, controlling for sociodemographics including income and education, determined the cross-sectional associations between health literacy and COPD-related health status: COPD Severity Score, COPD Helplessness Index, and Airways Questionnaire-20R [measuring respiratory-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL)]. Multivariable logistic regression estimated associations between health literacy and COPD-related hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits. KEY RESULTS: Taking socioeconomic status into account, poorer health literacy (lowest tertile compared to highest tertile) was associated with: worse COPD severity (+2.3 points; 95 % CI 0.3-4.4); greater COPD helplessness (+3.7 points; 95 % CI 1.6-5.8); and worse respiratory-specific HRQoL (+3.5 points; 95 % CI 1.8-4.9). Poorer health literacy, also controlling for the same covariates, was associated with higher likelihood of COPD-related hospitalizations (OR = 6.6; 95 % CI 1.3-33) and COPD-related ED visits (OR = 4.7; 95 % CI 1.5-15). Analyses for trend across health literacy tertiles were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for all above outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Independent of socioeconomic status, poor health literacy is associated with greater COPD severity, greater COPD helplessness, worse respiratory-specific HRQoL, and higher odds of COPD-related emergency health-care utilization. These results underscore that COPD patients with poor health literacy may be at particular risk for poor health-related outcomes.","Aged Emergency Service, Hospital/utilization Female Health Literacy/*statistics & numerical data Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data Humans Male Middle Aged Prognosis Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/psychology/*rehabilitation Quality of Life Severity of Illness Index Socioeconomic Factors United States"

Frequently, smokers report about sleep problems. Sleep disturbance, in turn, has been demonstrated to be involved in the pathophysiology of several disorders related to smoking and may be relevant for the pathophysiology of nicotine dependence. Therefore, determining the frequency of sleep disturbance in otherwise healthy smokers and its association with degree of nicotine dependence is highly relevant. In a population-based case-control study, 1071 smokers and 1243 non-smokers without lifetime Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Axis I disorder were investigated. Sleep quality (SQ) of participants was determined by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. As possible confounders, age, sex and level of education and income, as well as depressiveness, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity, alcohol drinking behaviour and perceived stress, were included into multiple regression analyses. Significantly more smokers than non-smokers (28.1% versus 19.1%; P < 0.0001) demonstrated a disturbed global SQ. After controlling for the confounders, impaired scores in the component scores of sleep latency, sleep duration and global SQ were found significantly more often in smokers than non-smokers. Consistently, higher degrees of nicotine dependence and intensity of smoking were associated with shorter sleep duration. This study demonstrates for the first time an elevated prevalence of sleep disturbance in smokers compared with non-smokers in a population without lifetime history of psychiatric disorders even after controlling for potentially relevant risk factors. It appears likely that smoking is a behaviourally modifiable risk factor for the occurrence of impaired SQ and short sleep duration.",Missing
22952187,Systematic review and meta-analysis of school-based interventions to improve daily fruit and vegetable intake in children aged 5 to 12 y.,Am J Clin Nutr,Evans CE and Christian MS and Cleghorn CL and Greenwood DC and Cade JE,Missing,"BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, no reviews have assessed the impact of a range of multi- and single-component school-based programs on daily fruit and vegetable intake by using a meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of school-based interventions on fruit and vegetable intake in children aged 5-12 y. DESIGN: A systematic literature review was carried out to identify randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials that were based in primary schools and designed to increase portions of daily fruit and vegetable intake. MEDLINE, Cochrane libraries, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Educational Information Centre were searched from 1985 to 2009. Data were extracted, and mean effect sizes were calculated by using random effects models. RESULTS: A total of 27 school-based programs involving 26,361 children were identified that met the inclusion criteria and assessed the daily weight of fruit and vegetable intake combined, fruit intake only, or vegetable intake only, and 21 studies were used in meta-analyses. The results of the meta-analyses indicated an improvement of 0.25 portions (95% CI: 0.06, 0.43 portions) of fruit and vegetable daily intake if fruit juice was excluded and an improvement of 0.32 portions (95% CI: 0.14, 0.50 portions) if fruit juice was included. Improvement was mainly due to increases in fruit consumption but not in vegetable consumption. The results of the meta-analyses for fruit (excluding juice) and vegetables separately indicated an improvement of 0.24 portions (95% CI: 0.05, 0.43 portions) and 0.07 portions (95% CI: -0.03, 0.16 portions), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: School-based interventions moderately improve fruit intake but have minimal impact on vegetable intake. Additional studies are needed to address the barriers for success in changing dietary behavior, particularly in relation to vegetables.","Child Child Behavior Child, Preschool Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic *Diet/adverse effects Female *Food Services *Fruit Health Promotion/*methods Humans *Schools *Vegetables"
22939580,Longevity of implantable electrophysiology devices explanted from patients having autopsy in hospitals.,Am J Cardiol,Zamani P and Kirkpatrick JN and Litzky LA and Verdino RJ,upenn,"The cost of cardiac implantable electrophysiologic devices (CIEDs) remains prohibitively high for many patients in low- and middle-income countries. Recent efforts have focused on obtaining CIEDs for donation and reuse in low- and middle-income countries from funeral homes and after device upgrades. Most patients in the United States die in health care facilities, yet few data exist on the acceptability for reuse of devices from hospital morgues. Three hundred thirty-four autopsies were performed at the University of Pennsylvania morgue from February 2009 to July 2011, during which CIEDs were routinely removed and collected. Devices were interrogated to ascertain remaining longevity. When a longevity estimate was not provided by the device, the manufacturer was contacted to obtain an estimate. Date of death was obtained from the electronic medical record. Twenty-seven patients (8% of autopsies performed) had CIEDs, of which 17 (63%) were pacemakers and 10 (37%) were implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. Two of the defibrillators were part of cardiac resynchronization therapy systems. CIEDs were interrogated 1.7 +/- 0.7 years after death. The mean time between implantation and death was 2.5 +/- 2.3 years, but 13 (48%) devices were implanted within 1 year of death. Nine devices (33%) had <1 year of battery life remaining, 10 devices (37%) had an estimated longevity of 1 to 4 years, and 8 devices (30%) had longevity estimates of >/=4 years. In conclusion, a significant percentage of patients who underwent autopsy had CIEDs implanted <1 year before death. Hospital morgues may serve as a source for devices in reuse programs, provided patients or their next of kin authorize donation.","Aged Autopsy Defibrillators, Implantable/*statistics & numerical data Equipment Failure Heart Failure/*mortality/therapy Hospitals/*statistics & numerical data Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Pacemaker, Artificial/*statistics & numerical data Proportional Hazards Models Retrospective Studies United States/epidemiology"

We analysed the relation between job strain and coronary heart disease with a meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies. METHODS: We used individual records from 13 European cohort studies (1985-2006) of men and women without coronary heart disease who were employed at time of baseline assessment. We measured job strain with questions from validated job-content and demand-control questionnaires. We extracted data in two stages such that acquisition and harmonisation of job strain measure and covariables occurred before linkage to records for coronary heart disease. We defined incident coronary heart disease as the first non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death. FINDINGS: 30,214 (15%) of 197,473 participants reported job strain. In 1.49 million person-years at risk (mean follow-up 7.5 years [SD 1.7]), we recorded 2358 events of incident coronary heart disease. After adjustment for sex and age, the hazard ratio for job strain versus no job strain was 1.23 (95% CI 1.10-1.37). This effect estimate was higher in published (1.43, 1.15-1.77) than unpublished (1.16, 1.02-1.32) studies. Hazard ratios were likewise raised in analyses addressing reverse causality by exclusion of events of coronary heart disease that occurred in the first 3 years (1.31, 1.15-1.48) and 5 years (1.30, 1.13-1.50) of follow-up. We noted an association between job strain and coronary heart disease for sex, age groups, socioeconomic strata, and region, and after adjustments for socioeconomic status, and lifestyle and conventional risk factors. The population attributable risk for job strain was 3.4%. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that prevention of workplace stress might decrease disease incidence; however, this strategy would have a much smaller effect than would tackling of standard risk factors, such as smoking.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study design with equalized assignments into age groups. SETTING: National laboratory and university. PATIENT(S): Nonclinical group of 22-80-year-old nonsmoking men (n = 80) who reported no fertility problems. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Sperm DNA damage measured by alkaline and neutral DNA electrophoresis (i.e., sperm Comet assay). RESULT(S): Sociodemographics, occupational exposures, medical and reproductive histories, and lifestyle habits were determined by questionnaire. The average daily dietary and supplement intake of micronutrients (vitamin C, vitamin E, b-carotene, zinc, and folate) was determined using the 100-item Modified Block Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Men with the highest intake of vitamin C had approximately 16% less sperm DNA damage (alkaline sperm Comet) than men with the lowest intake, with similar findings for vitamin E, folate, and zinc (but not beta-carotene). Older men (>44 years) with the highest vitamin C intake had approximately 20% less sperm DNA damage compared with older men with the lowest intake, with similar findings for vitamin E and zinc. The older men with the highest intake of these micronutrients showed levels of sperm damage that were similar to those of the younger men. However, younger men (<44 years) did not benefit from higher intakes of the micronutrients surveyed. CONCLUSION(S): Men with higher dietary and supplement intake of certain micronutrients may produce sperm with less DNA damage, especially among older men. This raises the broader question of how lifestyle factors, including higher intakes of antioxidants and micronutrients, might protect somatic as well as germ cells against age-associated genomic damage.","Adult Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Aging/*genetics/pathology Antioxidants/administration & dosage California Comet Assay Cross-Sectional Studies *DNA Damage Diet Dietary Supplements Humans Life Style Linear Models Male Micronutrients/*administration & dosage Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Nutrition Assessment Questionnaires Semen Analysis/methods Spermatozoa/chemistry/*drug effects/pathology Vitamins/administration & dosage Young Adult Zinc/administration & dosage"

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy of a paced respiration intervention against breathing control and usual care control for vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms. DESIGN: A 16-week, 3-group, partially blinded, controlled trial with 2:2:1 randomization and stratification by group (breast cancer, no cancer), in a Midwestern city and surrounding area. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and eighteen randomized women (96 breast cancer survivors, 122 menopausal women without cancer), recruited through community mailings and registries (29 % minority). INTERVENTIONS: Training, home practice support, and instructions to use the breathing at the time of each hot flash were delivered via compact disc with printed booklet (paced respiration intervention) or digital videodisc with printed booklet (fast shallow breathing control). Usual care control received a letter regarding group assignment. MAIN MEASURES: Hot flash frequency, severity, and bother (primary); hot flash interference in daily life, perceived control over hot flashes, and mood and sleep disturbances (secondary). Intervention performance, adherence, and adverse events were assessed. KEY RESULTS: There were no significant group differences for primary outcomes at 8-weeks or 16-weeks post-randomization. Most intervention participants did not achieve 50 % reduction in vasomotor symptoms, despite demonstrated ability to correctly do paced respiration and daily practice. Statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes at 8 and 16 weeks were small, not likely to be clinically relevant, and as likely to favor intervention as breathing control.

22967852,Prospective study of restless legs syndrome and coronary heart disease among women.,Circulation,Li Y and Walters AS and Chiuve SE and Rimm EB and Winkelman JW and Gao X,harvard,"BACKGROUND: Previous cross-sectional studies suggested a positive association between restless legs syndrome (RLS) and coronary heart disease (CHD). This observation was not confirmed by subsequent prospective studies. However, these prospective studies did not take into account the duration of RLS symptoms. Therefore, we prospectively examined whether RLS was associated with an increased risk of CHD in women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, taking into account the duration of RLS symptoms. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 70 977 women (mean age, 67 years) who were free of CHD and stroke at baseline (2002) were followed up until 2008. Physician-diagnosed RLS was collected via questionnaire. CHD was defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction or fatal CHD. Women with RLS at baseline had a marginally higher risk of developing CHD (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-2.18) compared with women without RLS. The risk was dependent on duration of symptoms: 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.44-2.19) for women with RLS for <3 years and 1.72 (95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.73) for women with RLS for >/=3 years (P trend=0.03). The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of women with RLS for >/=3 years were 1.80 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-3.01) for nonfatal myocardial infarction and 1.49 (95% confidence interval, 0.55-4.04) for fatal CHD relative to women without RLS. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that women with RLS for at least 3 years had an elevated risk of CHD.

METHODS: In the current randomized controlled trial, 131 patients with advanced cancer who received radiotherapy and their caregivers were randomly assigned to either a 6-session, structured, multidisciplinary intervention arm or a standard care arm. The average age of the patients was 58 years, the majority were male (63%), and tumor types varied (gastrointestinal [37%], brain [22%], head and neck [16%], lung [13%], and other [12%]). The six 90-minute sessions addressed the 5 domains of QOL: cognitive, physical, emotional, social, and spiritual. The in-person intervention was followed by 10 brief telephone counseling sessions that took place over the next 6 months. RESULTS: Of the 117 patients who completed the study, overall QOL (assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G]) at week 4 was significantly higher in the intervention group (n = 54) compared with the standard arm control group (n = 63) (75.2 vs 68.7; P = .02). The 10 brief telephone contacts did not appear to impact QOL because at week 27 the groups had identical QOL (means of 77.6 and 77.7, respectively). There was no effect of the intervention noted on caregiver QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Participating in a 6-session multidisciplinary intervention was found to be effective in maintaining the QOL of patients with advanced cancer who were actively receiving radiotherapy. The QOL and symptom burden of this population is striking, making it important to identify effective QOL strategies to implement in conjunction with cancer care.",Aged Analysis of Variance Caregivers/psychology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplasms/psychology/*radiotherapy *Quality of Life Social Support

In this article, the American Cancer Society updates a previous report on cancer statistics for Hispanics using incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2012, an estimated 112,800 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed and 33,200 cancer deaths will occur among Hispanics. In 2009, the most recent year for which actual data are available, cancer surpassed heart disease as the leading cause of death among Hispanics. Among US Hispanics during the past 10 years of available data (2000-2009), cancer incidence rates declined by 1.7% per year among men and 0.3% per year among women, while cancer death rates declined by 2.3% per year in men and 1.4% per year in women. Hispanics have lower incidence and death rates than non-Hispanic whites for all cancers combined and for the 4 most common cancers (breast, prostate, lung and bronchus, and colorectum). However, Hispanics have higher incidence and mortality rates for cancers of the stomach, liver, uterine cervix, and gallbladder, reflecting greater exposure to cancer-causing infectious agents, lower rates of screening for cervical cancer, differences in lifestyle and dietary patterns, and possibly genetic factors. Strategies for reducing cancer risk among Hispanics include increasing utilization of screening and available vaccines, as well as implementing effective interventions to reduce obesity, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use.","Adolescent Adult Aged Cause of Death Child Child, Preschool Emigrants and Immigrants European Continental Ancestry Group Female Forecasting Hispanic Americans/*statistics & numerical data Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Latin America/ethnology Male Mexico/ethnology Middle Aged Neoplasms/*epidemiology Puerto Rico/ethnology Registries SEER Program Sex Distribution South America/ethnology Survival Rate United States/epidemiology Young Adult"
22987883,"Hypertension screening during ambulatory pediatric visits in the United States, 2000-2009.",Pediatrics,Shapiro DJ and Hersh AL and Cabana MD and Sutherland SM and Patel AI,Missing,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hypertension occurs in 2% to 5% of children in the United States, and its prevalence has increased during the obesity epidemic. There is no consensus among professional organizations about how frequently blood pressure should be measured in children >3 years old. The purpose of this study was to estimate the frequency of hypertension screening during ambulatory pediatric visits in the United States and to determine patient- and provider-level factors associated with screening during visits specifically for preventive care. METHODS: We analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of ambulatory visits by using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2000 through 2009. In the subset of visits involving patients aged 3 to 18 years, we estimated the frequency of screening during all visits, preventive visits, and preventive visits in which overweight/obesity was diagnosed. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify patient- and provider-level factors associated with screening. RESULTS: Hypertension screening occurred during 35% of ambulatory pediatric visits, 67% of preventive visits, and 84% of preventive visits in which overweight/obesity was diagnosed. Between 2000 and 2009, the frequency of screening increased in all visits and in preventive visits. Factors independently associated with screening included older age and overweight/obesity diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Providers do not measure blood pressure in two-thirds of pediatric visits and one-third of pediatric preventive visits. Providers may understand the importance of screening among overweight/obese children; however, efforts to encourage routine screening, particularly in young children, may be needed.","Adolescent Ambulatory Care/*statistics & numerical data Blood Pressure Determination/statistics & numerical data Child Child Health Services/*statistics & numerical data Child, Preschool Female Health Care Surveys Humans Hypertension/complications/*diagnosis Logistic Models Male Multivariate Analysis Obesity/complications/diagnosis Overweight/complications/diagnosis Physician's Practice Patterns/*statistics & numerical data Preventive Health Services/*statistics & numerical data United States"

In this study, we tested the leukocyte mRNA expression levels of genes belonging to glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function (FKBP-4, FKBP-5, and GR), inflammation (interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, macrophage inhibiting factor (MIF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha), and neuroplasticity (brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), p11 and VGF), in healthy controls (n=34) and depressed patients (n=74), before and after 8 weeks of treatment with escitalopram or nortriptyline, as part of the Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression study. Non-responders had higher baseline mRNA levels of IL-1beta (+33%), MIF (+48%), and TNF-alpha (+39%). Antidepressants reduced the levels of IL-1beta (-6%) and MIF (-24%), and increased the levels of GR (+5%) and p11 (+8%), but these changes were not associated with treatment response. In contrast, successful antidepressant response was associated with a reduction in the levels of IL-6 (-9%) and of FKBP5 (-11%), and with an increase in the levels of BDNF (+48%) and VGF (+20%)-that is, response was associated with changes in genes that did not predict, at the baseline, the response. Our findings indicate a dissociation between 'predictors' and 'targets' of antidepressant responders. Indeed, while higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines predict lack of future response to antidepressants, changes in inflammation associated with antidepressant response are not reflected by all cytokines at the same time. In contrast, modulation of the GR complex and of neuroplasticity is needed to observe a therapeutic antidepressant effect.",Adult Aged Antidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage Depressive Disorder/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism Drug Delivery Systems/*methods Female Genetic Association Studies/*methods Genome-Wide Association Study/*methods Humans Interleukin-1beta/biosynthesis/genetics Intramolecular Oxidoreductases/biosynthesis/genetics Longitudinal Studies Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/biosynthesis/genetics Male Middle Aged Predictive Value of Tests Transcriptome/drug effects/*genetics Treatment Outcome Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics

We investigated whether full coverage of long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets (LLINs) may induce a switch in biting behavior in Anopheles funestus, a major malaria vector in Africa. METHODS: Human-landing collections were conducted indoor and outdoor in 2 villages (Lokohoue and Tokoli) in Benin before and 1 year and 3 years after implementation of universal LLIN coverage. Proportion of outdoor biting (POB) and median catching times (MCT) were compared. The resistance of A. funestus to deltamethrin was monitored using bioassays. RESULTS: MCT of A. funestus switched from 2 AM in Lokohoue and 3 AM in Tokoli to 5 AM after 3 years (Mann-Whitney U test, P < .0001). In Tokoli, POB increased from 45% to 68.1% (odds ratio = 2.55; 95 confidence interval = 1.72-3.78; P < .0001) 1 year after the universal coverage, whereas POB was unchanged in Lokohoue. In Lokohoue, however, the proportion of A. funestus that bites after 6 am was 26%. Bioassays showed no resistance to deltamethrin. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for a switch in malaria vectors' biting behavior after the implementation of LLIN at universal coverage. These findings might have direct consequences for malaria control in Africa and highlighted the need for alternative strategies for better targeting malaria vectors.","Animals Anopheles/*physiology Behavior, Animal/drug effects Benin Biological Assay Feeding Behavior/drug effects Female Humans Insect Bites and Stings/*prevention & control Insect Vectors/*physiology Insecticide Resistance Insecticide-Treated Bednets/*utilization Insecticides/*pharmacology Malaria/transmission Mosquito Control/methods Nitriles/*pharmacology Pyrethrins/*pharmacology"

DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: New South Wales, Australia, 1994-2008. POPULATION: A total of 781 907 women and their 1 309 501 maternities. METHODS: Cancer and maternal information were obtained from linked cancer registry, birth and hospital records for the entire population. Generalised estimating equations with a logit link were used to examine associations between cancer risk factors and pregnancy outcomes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of pregnancy-associated cancer (diagnosis during pregnancy or within 12 months of delivery), maternal morbidities, preterm birth, and small- and large-for-gestational-age (LGA). RESULTS: A total of 1798 new cancer diagnoses were identified, including 499 during pregnancy and 1299 postpartum. From 1994 to 2007, the crude incidence rate of pregnancy-associated cancer increased from 112.3 to 191.5 per 100 000 maternities (P < 0.001), and only 14% of the increase was explained by increasing maternal age. Cancer diagnosis was more common than expected in women aged 15-44 years (observed-to-expected ratio 1.49; 95% CI 1.42-1.56). Cancers were predominantly melanoma (33.3%) and breast cancer (21.0%). Women with cancer diagnosed during pregnancy had high rates of labour induction (28.5%), caesarean section (40.0%) and planned preterm birth (19.7%). Novel findings included a cancer association with multiple pregnancies (adjusted odds ratio 1.52, 95% CI 1.13-2.05) and LGA (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.14-1.89). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy-associated cancers have increased, and this increase is only partially explained by increasing maternal age.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The study retrospectively analyses the prospectively collected data on 2571 consecutive PPCI-treated STEMI patients between March 2008 and June 2011. Of these, 1036 patients (40.3%) underwent PPCI during a weekday between 08:00 and 18:00 (routine-hours group) and 1535 patients (59.7%) underwent PPCI on a weekday between 18:00 and 08:00 or a weekend (out-of-hours group). Compared with the routine-hours group, the out-of-hours group had a lower mean age, fewer patients with previous angina, longer call-to-hospital time, and fewer multivessel PCI. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 4.5% with no significant difference [0.2%, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.4 to 1.9%] between the routine-hours group (4.3%) and the out-of-hours group (4.6%) (adjusted odds ratio: 1.33, 95% CI: 0.73-2.40, P = 0.35). During a mean follow-up period of 560 days, 295 patients (11.5%) died, 12.2% in the routine-hours group and 11.0% in the out-of-hours group (difference of -0.1%, 95% CI: -0.4 to 0.2%). In the multiple Cox proportional hazards model, there was no difference in mortality between the two groups (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.82-1.46, P = 0.57). Similarly, no increase in mortality was seen in patients who underwent PPCI later at night (22:00-06:00). CONCLUSION: This study of real-world, unselected STEMI patients demonstrates that in a large, well-staffed centre, PPCI outside routine-working hours is safe with no difference in outcome of in-hospital and long-term mortality compared with PPCI during routine-working hours.","*After-Hours Care Aged, 80 and over Female Hospital Mortality Humans Male Middle Aged Myocardial Infarction/mortality/*therapy Percutaneous Coronary Intervention/*mortality Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Retrospective Studies Time-to-Treatment Treatment Outcome"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with invasive malignancies and fatigue were randomly assigned to either 2 g/d of L-carnitine oral supplementation or matching placebo. The primary end point was the change in average daily fatigue from baseline to week 4 using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-six patients were randomly assigned to treatment with L-carnitine supplementation or placebo. L-carnitine supplementation resulted in significant carnitine plasma level increase by week 4. The primary outcome, fatigue, measured using the BFI, improved in both arms compared with baseline (L-carnitine: -0.96, 95% CI, -1.32 to -0.60; placebo: -1.11, 95% CI -1.44 to -0.78). There were no statistically significant differences between arms (P = .57). Secondary outcomes, including fatigue measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue instrument, depression, and pain, did not show significant difference between arms. A separate analysis of patients who were carnitine-deficient at baseline did not show statistically significant improvement in fatigue or other outcomes after L-carnitine supplementation. CONCLUSION: Four weeks of 2 g of L-carnitine supplementation did not improve fatigue in patients with invasive malignancies and good performance status.",Carnitine/*administration & dosage/blood Complementary Therapies/*methods Dietary Supplements Double-Blind Method Fatigue/blood/*drug therapy/etiology Female Humans Male Neoplasms/blood/*complications/drug therapy Treatment Outcome

22984447,The consequences of high cigarette excise taxes for low-income smokers.,PLoS One,Farrelly MC and Nonnemaker JM and Watson KA,rti,"BACKGROUND: To illustrate the burden of high cigarette excise taxes on low-income smokers. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using data from the New York and national Adult Tobacco Surveys from 2010-2011, we estimated how smoking prevalence, daily cigarette consumption, and share of annual income spent on cigarettes vary by annual income (less than $30,000; $30,000-$59,999; and more than $60,000). The 2010-2011 sample includes 7,536 adults and 1,294 smokers from New York and 3,777 adults and 748 smokers nationally. Overall, smoking prevalence is lower in New York (16.1%) than nationally (22.2%) and is strongly associated with income in New York and nationally (P<.001). Smoking prevalence ranges from 12.2% to 33.7% nationally and from 10.1% to 24.3% from the highest to lowest income group. In 2010-2011, the lowest income group spent 23.6% of annual household income on cigarettes in New York (up from 11.6% in 2003-2004) and 14.2% nationally. Daily cigarette consumption is not related to income.

22913297,Exposure to second-hand smoke damages everyday prospective memory.,Addiction,Heffernan TM and O'Neill TS,Missing,"AIMS: Prospective memory (PM: remembering future intentions and activities) is critical to everyday remembering. This study compared a group of never-smokers who reported regular exposure to second-hand smoke (the SHS group) with a group of current smokers (the CS group) and a group of never-smokers who reported never having been exposed to SHS (the non-SHS group) on objective PM. DESIGN: An existing groups design was employed to compare the SHS, CS and non-SHS groups. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Twenty-four SHS, 27 CS and 28 non-SHS were tested on objective PM. All participants were university undergraduates aged between 18-30 years. All participants were tested individually in a laboratory setting. MEASUREMENTS: The Cambridge Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMPT) was used to assess objective PM. Age, other drug use, mood and IQ were also measured as covariates in the study. FINDINGS: The non-SHS group recalled significantly more time-based PM tasks than the SHS group (means = 16.3 versus 13.7, P < 0.001) and significantly more than the CS group (CS mean = 11.6, P < 0.001); and the SHS group recalled significantly more time-based tasks than the CS group (P < 0.002). The non-SHS group recalled significantly more event-based PM tasks than the CS group (means = 15.2 versus 11.3, P < 0.002) with no significant difference between the non-SHS group and SHS group (SHS mean = 14.3, P = 0.234); and the SHS group recalled significantly more event-based tasks than the CS group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke may suffer impairment in time-based prospective memory.","Adolescent Adult Female Humans Inhalation Exposure/*adverse effects Male *Memory, Episodic Neuropsychological Tests Residence Characteristics Smoking/*adverse effects Social Environment Time Factors Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects Young Adult"

In this study, we evaluated the effects of a scalable weight management program for children and teenagers. METHODS: Participants were 155 children and their parent/guardian. Children had a mean +/- SD age of 11.3 +/- 2.8 years, BMI z score of 2.23 +/- 0.41, and a percentage overweight of 72.5 +/- 34.0. Most (92%) were obese, and nearly half (46.5%) were >/= 99th percentile for BMI. The primary outcome was change in percentage overweight from baseline to 6 months. RESULTS: At 6 months, children experienced a 3.4 percentage point reduction in percentage overweight (P = .001). Children <13 years had a 4.3 percentage point reduction in percentage overweight, whereas those >/= 13 years had a 1.0 percentage point reduction. Those who attended a greater number of face-to-face group sessions experienced greater changes in percentage overweight. There were significant improvements in child health-related quality of life as reported by both children and their parents.

We examined the association between this program and abdominal ultrasonography for AAA screening, elective AAA repair, hospitalization for AAA rupture, and all-cause mortality. METHODS: We used a 20% sample of traditional Medicare enrollees from 2004 to 2008 to identify 65-year-old men eligible for screening and 3 control groups not eligible for screening (70-year-old men, 76-year-old men, and 65-year-old women). We used logistic regression to examine the change in outcomes at 365 days for eligible vs ineligible beneficiaries before and after SAAAVE Act implementation, adjusting for comorbidities, state-level smoking prevalence, geographic variation, and time trends. RESULTS: Fewer than 3% of abdominal ultrasonography claims after 2007 were for SAAAVE-specific AAA screening. There was a significantly greater increase in abdominal ultrasonography use among SAAAVE-eligible beneficiaries (2.0 percentage points among 65-year-old men, from 7.6% in 2004 to 9.6% in 2008; 0.7 points [8.9% to 9.6%] among 70-year-old men; 0.7 points [10.8% to 11.5%] among 76-year-old men; and 0.9 points [7.5% to 8.4%] among 65-year-old women) (P < .001 for all comparisons with 65-year-old men). The SAAAVE Act was associated with increased use of abdominal ultrasonography in 65-year-old men compared with 70-year-old men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.15; 95% CI, 1.11-1.19) (P < .001), and this increased use remained even when SAAAVE-specific AAA screening was excluded (AOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08-1.16) (P < .001). Implementation of the SAAAVE Act was not associated with changes in rates of AAA repair, AAA rupture, or all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the SAAAVE Act on AAA screening was modest and was based on abdominal ultrasonography use that it did not directly reimburse. The SAAAVE Act had no discernable effect on AAA rupture or all-cause morality.","Aged Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/*economics/epidemiology/*ultrasonography Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Mass Screening/economics/*utilization Medicare/*economics Odds Ratio Prevalence Reproducibility of Results Retrospective Studies Sex Factors Survival Rate/trends United States/epidemiology"
22974572,Racial disparity in fracture risk between white and nonwhite children in the United States.,J Pediatr,Wren TA and Shepherd JA and Kalkwarf HJ and Zemel BS and Lappe JM and Oberfield S and Dorey FJ and Winer KK and Gilsanz V,usc,"OBJECTIVES: To examine risk factors for fracture in a racially diverse cohort of healthy children in the US. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1470 healthy children, aged 6-17 years, underwent yearly evaluations of height, weight, body mass index, skeletal age, sexual maturation, calcium intake, physical activity levels, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone and fat measurements for up to 6 years. Fracture information was obtained at each annual visit, and risk factors for fracture were examined using the time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The overall fracture incidence was 0.034 fracture per person-year with 212 children reporting a total of 257 fractures. Being white (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.1), being male (HR = 1.8), and having skeletal age of 10-14 years (HR = 2.2) were the strongest risk factors for fracture (all P </= .001). Increased sports participation (HR = 1.4), lower body fat percentage (HR = 0.97), and previous fracture in white girls (HR = 2.1) were also significant risk factors (all P </= .04). Overall, fracture risk decreased with higher DXA z scores, except in white boys, who had increased fracture risk with higher DXA z scores (HR = 1.7, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Boys and girls of European descent had double the fracture risk of children from other backgrounds, suggesting that the genetic predisposition to fractures seen in elderly adults also manifests in children.","Absorptiometry, Photon Adiposity Adolescent African Americans Age Determination by Skeleton Asian Americans Body Mass Index Calcium, Dietary Child European Continental Ancestry Group Exercise Female Fractures, Bone/*ethnology/etiology *Health Status Disparities Health Surveys Hispanic Americans Humans Incidence Longitudinal Studies Male Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Risk Factors Sexual Maturation United States/epidemiology"

We analyzed whether the cardiovascular risk associated with using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was associated with the time elapsed following first-time MI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified patients aged 30 years or older admitted with first-time MI in 1997 to 2009 and subsequent NSAID use by individual-level linkage of nationwide registries of hospitalization and drug dispensing from pharmacies in Denmark. We calculated the incidence rates of death and a composite end point of coronary death or nonfatal recurrent MIs associated with NSAID use in 1-year time intervals up to 5 years after inclusion and analyzed risk by using multivariable adjusted time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models. Of the 99 187 patients included, 43 608 (44%) were prescribed NSAIDs after the index MI. There were 36 747 deaths and 28 693 coronary deaths or nonfatal recurrent MIs during the 5 years of follow-up. Relative to noncurrent treatment with NSAIDs, the use of any NSAID in the years following MI was persistently associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio 1.59 [95% confidence interval, 1.49-1.69]) after 1 year and hazard ratio 1.63 [95% confidence interval, 1.52-1.74] after 5 years) and coronary death or nonfatal recurrent MI (hazard ratio, 1.30 [95% confidence interval,l 1.22-1.39] and hazard ratio, 1.41 [95% confidence interval, 1.28-1.55]). CONCLUSIONS: The use of NSAIDs is associated with persistently increased coronary risk regardless of time elapsed after first-time MI. We advise long-term caution in the use of NSAIDs for patients after MI.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/contraindications Cohort Studies Comorbidity Death, Sudden, Cardiac/*epidemiology Denmark/epidemiology Female Follow-Up Studies Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Myocardial Infarction/*mortality Pharmacy/statistics & numerical data Prognosis Proportional Hazards Models Registries/*statistics & numerical data Risk Factors"
22932282,Effects of dairy intake on body weight and fat: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,Am J Clin Nutr,Chen M and Pan A and Malik VS and Hu FB,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Some intervention studies have suggested that dairy products may influence body weight, but the results remain controversial. OBJECTIVE: We identified and quantified the effects of dairy consumption on body weight and fat mass from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). DESIGN: We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE databases (to April 2012) of English reports of RCTs regarding dairy consumption on body weight, body fat, or body weight and body fat in adults. The results across studies were pooled by using a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-nine RCTs were included with a total of 2101 participants. Overall, consumption of dairy products did not result in a significant reduction in weight (-0.14 kg; 95% CI: -0.66, 0.38 kg; I(2) = 86.3%). In subgroup analysis, consumption of dairy products reduced body weight in the context of energy restriction or short-term intervention (<1 y) trials but had the opposite effect in ad libitum dietary interventions or long-term trials (>/=1 y). Twenty-two RCTs that reported results on body fat showed a modest reduction in the dairy group (-0.45 kg; 95% CI: -0.79, -0.11 kg; I(2) = 70.9%), and further stratified analysis indicated significant beneficial effects of dairy intervention on body fat in energy-restricted or short-term trials but not in long-term or ad libitum studies. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis does not support the beneficial effect of increasing dairy consumption on body weight and fat loss in long-term studies or studies without energy restriction. However, dairy products may have modest benefits in facilitating weight loss in short-term or energy-restricted RCTs.","*Adiposity Adult *Body Weight *Dairy Products/adverse effects Diet, Reducing Humans Male Middle Aged Obesity/diet therapy/prevention & control Overweight/diet therapy/prevention & control Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Recurrence/prevention & control Weight Gain Weight Loss Young Adult"
22998757,Hospital-based shootings in the United States: 2000 to 2011.,Ann Emerg Med,Kelen GD and Catlett CL and Kubit JG and Hsieh YH,jhmi,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Workplace violence in health care settings is a frequent occurrence. Emergency departments (EDs) are considered particularly vulnerable. Gunfire in hospitals is of particular concern; however, information about such workplace violence is limited. Therefore, we characterize US hospital-based shootings from 2000 to 2011. METHODS: Using LexisNexis, Google, Netscape, PubMed, and ScienceDirect, we searched reports for acute care hospital shooting events in the United States for 2000 through 2011. All hospital-based shootings with at least 1 injured victim were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 9,360 search ""hits,"" 154 hospital-related shootings were identified, 91 (59%) inside the hospital and 63 (41%) outside on hospital grounds. Shootings occurred in 40 states, with 235 injured or dead victims. Perpetrators were overwhelmingly men (91%) but represented all adult age groups. The ED environs were the most common site (29%), followed by the parking lot (23%) and patient rooms (19%). Most events involved a determined shooter with a strong motive as defined by grudge (27%), suicide (21%), ""euthanizing"" an ill relative (14%), and prisoner escape (11%). Ambient society violence (9%) and mentally unstable patients (4%) were comparatively infrequent. The most common victim was the perpetrator (45%). Hospital employees composed 20% of victims; physician (3%) and nurse (5%) victims were relatively infrequent. Event characteristics that distinguished the ED from other sites included younger perpetrator, more likely in custody, and unlikely to have a personal relationship with the victim (ill relative, grudge, coworker). In 23% of shootings within the ED, the weapon was a security officer's gun taken by the perpetrator. Case fatality inside the hospital was much lower in the ED setting (19%) than other sites (73%). CONCLUSION: Although it is likely that not every hospital-based shooting was identified, such events are relatively rare compared with other forms of workplace violence. The unpredictable nature of this type of event represents a significant challenge to hospital security and effective deterrence practices because most perpetrators proved determined and a significant number of shootings occur outside the hospital building.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Female Firearms/*statistics & numerical data Hospitals/*statistics & numerical data Humans Male Middle Aged United States/epidemiology Violence/*statistics & numerical data Wounds, Gunshot/epidemiology/mortality Young Adult"

This policy statement is an update to previous statements, reflecting the current literature on prevalence, patterns, and mechanisms of trampoline-related injuries. Most trampoline injuries occur with multiple simultaneous users on the mat. Cervical spine injuries often occur with falls off the trampoline or with attempts at somersaults or flips. Studies on the efficacy of trampoline safety measures are reviewed, and although there is a paucity of data, current implementation of safety measures have not appeared to mitigate risk substantially. Therefore, the home use of trampolines is strongly discouraged.

POPULATION: A total of 7875 women aged 15-49 years who responded to the domestic violence and female circumcision modules in the 2006 administration of the DHS in Mali. METHODS: Multivariable logistic regression was used to compute adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to measure risk for IPV. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes of interest were IPV and its subtypes. RESULTS: Women with FGM were at heightened odds of IPV (aOR 2.71, 95% CI 2.17-3.38) and IPV subtypes: physical (aOR 2.85, 95% CI 2.22-3.66), sexual (aOR 3.24, 95% CI 1.80-5.82), and emotional (aOR 2.28, 95% CI 1.68-3.11). The odds of IPV increased with ascending FGM severity (P for trend <0.0001). The most elevated odds were observed among women with severe FGM, who were nearly nine times as likely to experience more than one IPV subtype (aOR 8.81, 95% CI 5.87-13.24). CONCLUSIONS: Study findings underscore the need for multi-tiered strategies, incorporating policy and education, to reduce FGM and IPV, potentially improving the holistic health and wellbeing of Malian women.","Adolescent Adult Circumcision, Female/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data Cross-Sectional Studies Female Health Surveys Humans Logistic Models Mali Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Odds Ratio Questionnaires Socioeconomic Factors Spouse Abuse/*statistics & numerical data Women's Health/*statistics & numerical data Young Adult"

Here we show for the first time that avian Plasmodium transmission occurs in the North American Arctic. Over a latitudinal gradient in Alaska, from 61 degrees N to 67 degrees N, we collected blood samples of resident and migratory bird species. We found both residents and hatch year birds infected with Plasmodium as far north as 64 degrees N, providing clear evidence that malaria transmission occurs in these climates.

The objective of this study was to use claims data to determine the rate of unfilled prescriptions in pediatric primary care and examine factors associated with prescription filling. METHODS: This retrospective observational study of pediatric primary care patients compares prescription data from an electronic medical record with insurance claims data. Illinois Medicaid provided claims data for 4833 patients who received 16953 prescriptions during visits at 2 primary care sites over 26 months. Prescriptions were compared with claims to determine filling within 1 day and 60 days. Clinical and demographic variables significant in univariate analysis were included in logistic regression models. RESULTS: Patients were 51% male; most (84%) spoke English and were African American (38.7%) or Hispanic (39.1%). Seventy-eight percent of all prescriptions were filled. Among filled prescriptions, 69% were filled within 1 day. African American, Hispanic, and male patients were significantly more likely to have filled prescriptions. Younger age was associated with filling within 1 day but not with filling within 60 days. Prescriptions for antibiotics, from one of the clinic sites, from sick/follow-up visits, and electronic prescriptions were significantly more likely to be filled. CONCLUSIONS: More than 20% of prescriptions in a pediatric primary care setting were never filled. The significant associations with clinical site, visit type, and electronic prescribing suggest system-level factors that affect prescription filling. Development of interventions to increase adherence should account for the factors that affect primary adherence.","Adolescent Child Child Health Services/*statistics & numerical data Child, Preschool Drug Prescriptions/*statistics & numerical data Electronic Health Records Female Humans Illinois Infant Infant, Newborn Insurance Claim Reporting/*statistics & numerical data Logistic Models Male Medicaid/statistics & numerical data Medication Adherence/*statistics & numerical data Multivariate Analysis Primary Health Care/*statistics & numerical data Retrospective Studies United States"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study to assess the impact of neighborhood walkability on diabetes incidence among recent immigrants (n = 214,882) relative to long-term residents (n = 1,024,380). Adults aged 30-64 years who were free of diabetes and living in Toronto, Canada, on 31 March 2005 were identified from administrative health databases and followed until 31 March 2010 for the development of diabetes, using a validated algorithm. Neighborhood characteristics, including walkability and income, were derived from the Canadian Census and other sources. RESULTS: Neighborhood walkability was a strong predictor of diabetes incidence independent of age and area income, particularly among recent immigrants (lowest [quintile 1 {Q1}] vs. highest [quintile 5 {Q5}] walkability quintile: relative risk [RR] 1.58 [95% CI 1.42-1.75] for men; 1.67 [1.48-1.88] for women) compared with long-term residents (Q1 to Q5) 1.32 [1.26-1.38] for men; 1.24 [1.18-1.31] for women). Coexisting poverty accentuated these effects; diabetes incidence varied threefold between recent immigrants living in low-income/low walkability areas (16.2 per 1,000) and those living in high-income/high walkability areas (5.1 per 1,000).

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: Women with operable breast cancer treated by a single surgeon between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2010. INTERVENTION: Selective preoperative MR imaging based on breast density and histologic findings. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reoperation rate and pathologically avoidable mastectomy at initial operation. RESULTS: Of 313 patients in the study, 120 underwent preoperative MR imaging. Patients undergoing MR imaging were younger (mean age, 53.6 vs 59.5 years; P < .001), were more often of non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity (61.7% vs 52.3%, P < .05), and more likely had heterogeneously dense or very dense breasts (68.4% vs 22.3%, P < .001). The incidence of lobular carcinoma (8.3% in the MR imaging group vs 5.2% in the no MR imaging group, P = .27) and the type of surgery performed (mastectomy vs partial mastectomy, P = .67) were similar in both groups. The mean pathological size of the index tumor in the MR imaging group was larger than that in the no MR imaging group (2.02 vs 1.72 cm, P = .009), but the extent of disease was comparable (75.8% in the MR imaging group vs 82.9% in the no MR imaging group had pathologically localized disease, P = .26). The reoperation rate was similar between the 2 groups (19.1% in the MR imaging group vs 17.6% in the no MR imaging group, P = .91) even when stratified by breast density (P = .76), pT2 tumor size (P = .35), or lobular carcinoma histologic findings (P = .26). Pathologically avoidable mastectomy (multifocal or multicentric MR imaging and unifocal histopathological findings) was observed in 12 of 47 patients (25.5%) with preoperative MR imaging who underwent mastectomy. CONCLUSION: The selective use of preoperative MR imaging to decrease reoperation in women with breast cancer is not supported by these data. In a considerable number of patients, MR imaging overestimates the extent of disease.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Breast Neoplasms/*pathology/*surgery Cohort Studies Female Humans *Magnetic Resonance Imaging Middle Aged Preoperative Care/*methods Reoperation/statistics & numerical data Retrospective Studies"

DESIGN: Comparison study. SETTING: Kirkby Sports College Centre for Learning, Liverpool, England. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen schoolchildren (10 boys and 8 girls) aged 11 to 15 years. MAIN EXPOSURE: A comparison of a traditional sedentary video game and 2 Kinect activity-promoting video games, Dance Central and Kinect Sports Boxing, each played for 15 minutes. Physiologic responses and energy expenditure were measured using a metabolic analyzer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Heart rate, oxygen uptake, and energy expenditure. RESULTS: Heart rate, oxygen uptake, and energy expenditure were considerably higher (P < .05) during activity-promoting video game play compared with rest and sedentary video game play. The mean (SD) corresponding oxygen uptake values for the sedentary, dance, and boxing video games were 6.1 (1.3), 12.8 (3.3), and 17.7 (5.1) mL . min-1 . kg-1, respectively. Energy expenditures were 1.5 (0.3), 3.0 (1.0), and 4.4 (1.6) kcal . min-1, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Dance Central and Kinect Sports Boxing increased energy expenditure by 150% and 263%, respectively, above resting values and were 103% and 194% higher than traditional video gaming. This equates to an increased energy expenditure of up to 172 kcal . h-1 compared with traditional sedentary video game play. Played regularly, active gaming using Kinect for the Xbox 360 could prove to be an effective means for increasing physical activity and energy expenditure in children.",Adolescent Boxing/*physiology Child Dancing/*physiology *Energy Metabolism Female *Heart Rate Humans Male *Oxygen Consumption *Video Games
22972849,The effect of smoking on ligament and cartilage surgery in the knee: a systematic review.,Am J Sports Med,Kanneganti P and Harris JD and Brophy RH and Carey JL and Lattermann C and Flanigan DC,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The adverse effects of smoking on various health conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease have been well documented. Many orthopaedic conditions, such as fracture healing, wound repair, and bone mineral density, have been reported to be adversely affected by smoking. However, no known systematic reviews have investigated the effects of smoking on ligament and cartilage knee surgery. PURPOSE: We hypothesized that smoking would have a negative influence from both a basic science and clinical outcome perspective on these types of knee surgeries. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A systematic review of multiple medical databases was performed evaluating clinical and basic science studies to determine the effects of smoking on ligament and cartilage knee surgery. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were found for inclusion and analysis. Eight of these studies addressed the relationship between smoking and knee ligaments, and 6 investigated the relationship between smoking and articular cartilage. With the exception of 1, all of the basic science and clinical studies exploring the relationship between smoking and knee ligaments found a negative association of smoking, either molecularly, biomechanically, or clinically. One basic science and 3 clinical studies found a negative influence of smoking on articular cartilage of the knee. No studies were found that investigated the relationship of smoking and menisci. CONCLUSION: The current literature reveals a negative influence of smoking on the results of knee ligament surgery, both from a basic science and clinical perspective, implying that smoking cessation would benefit patients undergoing these procedures. The association between smoking and knee articular cartilage was less clear, although the literature still suggests an overall negative influence and highlights the need for further investigation.","Cartilage, Articular/*surgery Humans Knee Injuries/*surgery Ligaments, Articular/*surgery Smoking/*adverse effects"

BACKGROUND: The Medicare National Coverage Determination for permanent pacemaker, which emphasized single-chamber pacing, has not changed significantly since 1985. We sought to define contemporary trends in permanent pacemaker use by analyzing a large national database. METHODS: We queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to identify permanent pacemaker implants between 1993 and 2009 using the International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification procedure codes for dual-chamber (DDD), single-ventricular (VVI), single-atrial (AAI), or biventricular (BiV) devices. Annual permanent pacemaker implantation rates and patient demographics were analyzed. RESULTS: Between 1993 and 2009, 2.9 million patients received permanent pacemakers in the United States. Overall use increased by 55.6%. By 2009, DDD use increased from 62% to 82% (p < 0.001), whereas single-chamber ventricular pacemaker use fell from 36% to 14% (p = 0.01). Use of DDD devices was higher in urban, nonteaching hospitals (79%) compared with urban teaching hospitals (76%) and rural hospitals (72%). Patients with private insurance (83%) more commonly received DDD devices than Medicaid (79%) or Medicare (75%) recipients (p < 0.001). Patient age and Charlson comorbidity index increased over time. Hospital charges ($2011) increased 45.3%, driven by the increased cost of DDD devices. CONCLUSIONS: There is a steady growth in the use of permanent pacemakers in the United States. Although DDD device use is increasing, whereas single-chamber ventricular pacemaker use is decreasing. Patients are becoming older and have more medical comorbidities. These trends have important health care policy implications.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Arrhythmias, Cardiac/epidemiology Comorbidity Female Hospitals/statistics & numerical data Humans Insurance Coverage/statistics & numerical data Male Pacemaker, Artificial/economics/*trends/utilization Prosthesis Implantation/trends Sick Sinus Syndrome/therapy Sinoatrial Block/therapy United States/epidemiology"

The effect of perceived stress on incident coronary heart disease (CHD) has yet to be reviewed systematically. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between perceived stress and incident CHD. Ovid, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO were searched as data sources. Prospective observational cohort studies were selected that measured self-reported perceived stress and assessed incident CHD at >/=6 months. We extracted study characteristics and estimates of the risk of incident CHD associated with high perceived stress versus low perceived stress. We identified 23 potentially relevant articles, of which 6 met our criteria (n = 118,696). Included studies measured perceived stress with validated measurements and nonvalidated simple self-report surveys. Incident CHD was defined as new diagnosis of, hospitalization for, or mortality secondary to CHD. Meta-analysis yielded an aggregate risk ratio of 1.27 (95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.45) for the magnitude of the relation between high perceived stress and incident CHD. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that high perceived stress is associated with a moderately increased risk of incident CHD.","Coronary Disease/epidemiology/*psychology Humans Perception Risk Factors Stress, Psychological/*complications"
22930461,The Great East Japan Earthquake Disaster and cardiovascular diseases.,Eur Heart J,Aoki T and Fukumoto Y and Yasuda S and Sakata Y and Ito K and Takahashi J and Miyata S and Tsuji I and Shimokawa H,Missing,"AIMS: While previous studies reported a short-term increase in individual cardiovascular disease (CVD) after great earthquakes, mid-term occurrences of all types of CVDs after great earthquakes are unknown. We addressed this important issue in our experience with the Great East Japan Earthquake (11 March 2011). METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively examined the impact of the Earthquake on the occurrences of CVDs and pneumonia by comparing the ambulance records made by doctors in our Miyagi Prefecture, the centre of the disaster area, during the periods of 2008-11 (n = 124,152). The weekly occurrences of CVDs, including heart failure (HF), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stroke, cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA), and pneumonia were all significantly increased after the Earthquake compared with the previous 3 years. The occurrences of ACS and CPA showed the rapid increase followed by a sharp decline, whereas those of HF and pneumonia showed a prolonged increase for more than 6 weeks and those of stroke and CPA showed a second peak after the largest aftershock (7 April 2011). Furthermore, the occurrence of CPA was increased in the first 24 h after the Earthquake, followed by other diseases later on. These increases were independent of age, sex, or residence area (seacoast vs. inland). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the occurrences of all types of CVDs and pneumonia were increased in somewhat different time courses after the Earthquake, including the first observation of the marked and prolonged increase in HF, emphasizing the importance of intensive medical management of all types of CVDs after great earthquakes.",Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology Disasters/*statistics & numerical data Earthquakes/*statistics & numerical data Female Humans Incidence Japan/epidemiology Male Middle Aged Pneumonia/epidemiology Retrospective Studies
23019271,Improvement in the health of HIV-infected persons in care: reducing disparities.,Clin Infect Dis,Moore RD and Keruly JC and Bartlett JG,jhmi,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment, major challenges remain in achieving access, retention, and adherence. Our inner-city HIV clinical practice in Baltimore has a diverse patient population with high rates of poverty, black race, and injection drug use (IDU), providing us the opportunity to compare health process and outcomes. METHODS: Using data collected in a clinical HIV cohort in Baltimore, we compared receipt of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA, CD4, incidence of opportunistic illness, and mortality from 1995 to 2010. Comparisons were made of these outcomes by HIV risk group, sex, and race (black, white). RESULTS: From 1995 to 2010, we followed 6366 patients comprising 27 941 person-years (PY) of follow-up. By 2010, 87% of patients were receiving ART; median HIV-1 RNA was <200 copies/mL, median CD4 was 475 cells/mm(3), opportunistic illness rates were 2.4 per 100 PY, and mortality rates were 2.1 per 100 PY, with no differences by demographic or HIV risk group. The only differences were that the IDU risk group had a median CD4 that was 79 cells/mm(3) lower and HIV-1 RNA 0.16 log(10 )copies/mL higher compared with other risk groups (P < .01). In 2009 a 28-year-old HIV-infected person was estimated to have 45.4 years of life remaining, which did not differ by demographic or behavioral risk group. DISCUSSION: Our results emphasize that advances in HIV treatment have had a positive impact on all affected demographic and behavioral risk groups in an HIV clinical setting, with an expected longevity for HIV-infected patients that is now 73 years.","AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections/epidemiology Adult Baltimore/epidemiology CD4 Lymphocyte Count Female HIV Infections/complications/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality *Health Status Disparities Humans Male Medication Adherence/statistics & numerical data Middle Aged RNA, Viral/blood Survival Analysis Treatment Outcome Viral Load"

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to (1) test the hypotheses that player sex, side of injury, and graft choice do not influence RTP and (2) define the risk for future ACL injury in soccer players after ACLR. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Soccer players in a prospective cohort were contacted to determine RTP after ACLR. Information regarding if and when they returned to play, their current playing status, the primary reason they stopped playing soccer (if relevant), and incidence of subsequent ACL surgery was recorded. RESULTS: Initially, 72% of 100 soccer athletes (55 male, 45 female) with a mean age of 24.2 years at the time of ACLR returned to soccer. At average follow-up of 7.0 years, 36% were still playing, a significant decrease compared with initial RTP (P < .0001). Based on multivariate analysis, older athletes (P = .006) and females (P = .037) were less likely to return to play. Twelve soccer athletes had undergone further ACL surgery, including 9 on the contralateral knee and 3 on the ipsilateral knee. In a univariate analysis, females were more likely to have future ACL surgery (20% vs 5.5%, P = .03). Soccer athletes who underwent ACLR on their nondominant limb had a higher future rate of contralateral ACLR (16%) than soccer athletes who underwent ACLR on their dominant limb (3.5%) (P = .03). CONCLUSION: Younger and male soccer players are more likely to return to play after ACL reconstruction. Return to soccer after ACLR declines over time.

23000498,Cardiac arrests in schools: assessing use of automated external defibrillators (AED) on school campuses.,Resuscitation,Swor R and Grace H and McGovern H and Weiner M and Walton E,beaumont,"BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac arrest in schools are infrequent, but emotionally charged events. The purpose of our study was to: (1) describe characteristics and outcomes of school cardiac arrests; and (2) assess the feasibility of conducting school bystander interviews to describe the events surrounding cardiac arrests, assess AED availability and use, and identify barriers to AED use. METHODS: We performed a telephone survey of bystanders to cardiac arrests occurring in K-12 schools in communities participating in the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) database and a local cardiac arrest database. The study period was from 8/2005 to 8/2011 and continued in one community through 2011. Utstein style descriptive data and outcomes were collected. A structured telephone interview of a bystander or administrative personnel was conducted for each cardiac arrest event. We collected a descriptive event summary, including provision of bystander CPR, presence of an AED and information regarding AED deployment, training, and use and perceived barriers to AED use. Descriptive data are reported. RESULTS: During the study period there were 30,603 cardiac arrests identified at study communities, of which 47 (0.15%) events were at K-12 schools. Of these, 21 (45.7%) were at high schools, a minority (16, 34.0%) were children (<age 19), most (39, 83.0%) were witnessed arrests, a majority (36, 76.6%) received bystander CPR, and 27 (57.4%) were initially in ventricular fibrillation (VF). Most arrests (28/40, 70%) occurred during the school day (7a-5p). From this population, 15 (31.9%) survived to hospital discharge. A telephone interview was completed for 30 of 47 K-12 events. Nineteen schools had an AED on site. Most schools (84.2%) with AEDs reported that they had a training program, and personnel identified for its use. An AED was applied in 11 of 19 patients, of these 8 were in VF and 4 (all VF) survived to hospital discharge. Bystanders identified multiple reasons for non-use of the AED in the other eight patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac arrests in schools are rare events, most patients are adults and receive bystander CPR. AED application by laypersons was infrequent but resulted in excellent (4/11) survival. AEDs were not used in a substantial proportion of incidents and further attention must be paid to planning for emergency response on school campuses. We also identified the difficulty in assessing school emergency care and advocate for the development of methods to evaluate the provision of emergency care on school campuses.",Adult Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/*statistics & numerical data Defibrillators/*supply & distribution/*utilization Emergency Treatment Humans Michigan/epidemiology Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/*epidemiology/therapy Questionnaires Registries Retrospective Studies *Schools Telephone Ventricular Fibrillation/epidemiology/therapy
22996103,Assisted reproductive technology and major birth defects in Western Australia.,Obstet Gynecol,Hansen M and Kurinczuk JJ and de Klerk N and Burton P and Bower C,uwa,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of major birth defects diagnosed by 6 years of age in all births and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly conceived by assisted reproductive technology (when this included intracytoplasmic sperm injection and in vitro fertilization [IVF]) and the remainder of nonassisted reproductive technology-conceived children born in Western Australia from 1994 to 2002. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data linkage between three population-based registers (Reproductive Technology Register, Western Australian Register of Developmental Anomalies, and Midwives' Notification of Birth System) to identify all assisted reproductive technology (n=2,911) and nonassisted reproductive technology (n=210,997) births with and without birth defects diagnosed by age 6 and all terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. RESULTS: A major birth defect was diagnosed in 8.7% of assisted reproductive technology and 5.4% of nonassisted reproductive technology singletons (odds ratio [OR] 1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-1.79), as well as 7.1% of assisted reproductive technology twins and 5.9% of nonassisted reproductive technology twins of unlike sex (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77-1.51). The prevalence of birth defects in assisted reproductive technology singletons and twins decreased markedly over the study period. This change was evident across all three clinics contributing data over the whole study and was particularly marked for children conceived as a result of IVF. CONCLUSION: There has been a decrease in the prevalence of birth defects over time in children born as a result of assisted reproductive technology in Western Australia; however, the prevalence of major birth defects in assisted reproductive technology singletons remains increased compared with nonassisted reproductive technology singletons.

23027171,Prevalence and correlates of exergaming in youth.,Pediatrics,O'Loughlin EK and Dugas EN and Sabiston CM and O'Loughlin JL,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: Less than 15% of children and adolescents participate regularly in physical activity (PA) and, with ever-increasing obesity, strategies to improve PA levels in youth are urgently needed. Exergaming offers a PA alternative that may be especially attractive in our increasingly technophilic society. However, there are no observational studies of exergaming in population-based samples of adolescents. The purpose of this study was to investigate potential sociodemographic, lifestyle, psychosocial, weight-related, and mental health correlates of exergaming as well as describe the type, timing, and intensity of exergaming in a population-based sample of adolescents. METHODS: Data on exergame use and potential sociodemographic, lifestyle, psychosocial, weight-related, and mental health correlates of exergaming were collected in mailed self-report questionnaires completed by 1241 grade 10 and 11 students from the Montreal area with a mean age of 16.8 years (SD = 0.05 years; 43% male) participating in the AdoQuest study. The independent correlates of exergaming were identified in multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Nearly one-quarter (24%) of participants reported exergaming. Exergamers played 2 days per week on average, for approximately 50 minutes each bout; 73% of exergamers played at a moderate or vigorous intensity. Exergamers were more likely than nonexergamers to be girls, to play nonactive video games, to watch >/=2 hours of television per day, to be stressed about weight, and to be nonsmokers. CONCLUSIONS: Many adolescents exergame at intensity levels that could help them achieve current moderate-to-vigorous PA recommendations.

Warmer temperatures accelerate growth and reproduction of ectotherms, whereas these processes are slowed or halted in colder temperatures. Female blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus inhabiting the Chesapeake Bay, exhibit a seasonal migratory behavior that is closely tied with spawning and the release of larvae. To better understand reproductive activities of the migratory adult females, we examined two reproductive parameters of these crabs sampled monthly (April-December, 2006): the levels of vitellogenin (VtG) in the hemolymph and VtG expression in the hepatopancreas and ovary. The full-length cDNA of VtG (CasVtG-ova) has been isolated from the ovary. The putative CasVtG sequence found in the ovary is >99% identical to that of the hepatopancreas and is related most closely to the sequences reported in other crab species. In female C. sapidus, the hepatopancreas produces over 99% of the total VtG toward the ovarian development. Ovarian stages 2 and 3 in the sampled females are characterized by significant high levels of VtG in hemolymph and VtG expression in both the hepatopancreas and ovary. However, during the southbound migration in fall, females at ovarian stages 2 and 3 have decreased VtG levels, compared to those in spring and summer. The decreased vitellogenesis activity during the fall migration suggests seasonal adaptation to ensure successful spawning and the larval release.",Missing
23027169,Physician attitudes regarding school-located vaccinations.,Pediatrics,McCormick EV and Durfee J and Vogt TM and Daley MF and Hambidge SJ and Shlay J,dhha,"OBJECTIVE: To assess physician attitudes regarding school-located adolescent vaccination and influenza vaccination. METHODS: From July through September 2010, a 20-item survey was mailed to 1337 practicing Colorado family physicians and pediatricians. Standard statistical methods were used to examine unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios of factors associated with physician support for school-located vaccination programs. RESULTS: Overall, 943 physicians were survey-eligible, and 584 (62%) responded. More than half of physicians supported both school-located influenza and adolescent vaccination. However, fewer physicians supported school-located adolescent vaccination compared with influenza vaccination. More physicians supported school-located vaccination for their publicly insured patients compared with their privately insured patients. Some family physicians (32%) and pediatricians (39%) believed that school-located vaccination would make their patients less likely to attend well-child visits, and half of respondents believed that school-located vaccination would have a negative financial impact on their practice. In multivariate analyses, physicians concerned about the financial impact of school-located vaccination were less likely to support such programs. CONCLUSIONS: Although a majority of Colorado physicians supported influenza and adolescent vaccination at school, they expressed concerns regarding the implications on their practice. Lesser support for vaccination of their privately insured patients and concerns regarding attendance at well-child visits suggests the perceived financial impact from school-located vaccination is a barrier and merits additional examination.","Adolescent *Attitude of Health Personnel Colorado Female Humans Influenza Vaccines Insurance, Health Male *Physicians *School Health Services *Vaccination"
23027917,Sleep disturbance and cardiovascular risk in adolescents.,CMAJ,Narang I and Manlhiot C and Davies-Shaw J and Gibson D and Chahal N and Stearne K and Fisher A and Dobbin S and McCrindle BW,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that inadequate or disturbed sleep is associated with increased cardiovascular risk in adults. There are limited data on sleep quality and associated cardiovascular risk in children. METHODS: We obtained data on adolescents from the 2009/10 cycle of the Healthy Heart Schools' Program, a population-based cross-sectional study in the Niagara region of Ontario. Participants underwent measurements of cardiometabolic risk factors, including body mass index (BMI), lipid profile and blood pressure, and they completed questionnaires measuring sleeping habits and nutritional status. We assessed sleep disturbance using the sleep disturbance score derived from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. We explored associations between sleeping habits and cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Among 4104 adolescents (51% male), the mean hours of sleep per night (+/- standard deviation) were 7.9 +/- 1.1 on weeknights and 9.4 +/- 1.6 on weekends. In total, 19% of participants reported their sleep quality as fairly bad or very bad on weeknights and 10% reported it as fairly bad or very bad on weekends. In the multivariable regression models, a higher sleep disturbance score was associated with increased odds of being at high cardiovascular risk (highest v. lowest tertile odds ratio [OR] 1.43 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.77], p < 0.001), increased odds of hypertension (highest v. lowest tertile OR 1.44 [95% CI 1.02-2.05], p = 0.05) and increased odds of elevated non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (highest v. lowest tertile OR 1.28 [95% CI 1.00-1.64], p = 0.05). The mean duration of sleep was not associated with these outcomes. INTERPRETATION: In healthy adolescents, sleep disturbance is associated with cardiovascular risk factor abnormalities.

23044786,"An observational study of the frequency, severity, and etiology of failures in postoperative care after major elective general surgery.",Ann Surg,Symons NR and Almoudaris AM and Nagpal K and Vincent CA and Moorthy K,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the nature of process failures in postoperative care, to assess their frequency and preventability, and to explore their relationship to adverse events. BACKGROUND: Adverse events are common and are frequently caused by failures in the process of care. These processes are often evaluated independently using clinical audit. There is little understanding of process failures in terms of their overall frequency, relative risk, and cumulative effect on the surgical patient. METHODS: Patients were observed daily from the first postoperative day until discharge by an independent surgeon. Field notes on the circumstances surrounding any nonroutine or atypical event were recorded. Field notes were assessed by 2 surgeons to identify failures in the process of care. Preventability, the degree of harm caused to the patient, and the underlying etiology of process failures were evaluated by 2 independent surgeons. RESULTS: Fifty patients undergoing major elective general surgery were observed for a total of 659 days of postoperative care. A total of 256 process failures were identified, of which 85% were preventable and 51% directly led to patient harm. Process failures occurred in all aspects of care, the most frequent being medication prescribing and administration, management of lines, tubes, and drains, and pain control interventions. Process failures accounted for 57% of all preventable adverse events. Communication failures and delays were the main etiologies, leading to 54% of process failures. CONCLUSIONS: Process failures are common in postoperative care, are highly preventable, and frequently cause harm to patients. Interventions to prevent process failures will improve the reliability of surgical postoperative care and have the potential to reduce hospital stay.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over *Digestive System Surgical Procedures Female General Surgery/standards Hospitals, Teaching/standards/statistics & numerical data Hospitals, Urban/standards/statistics & numerical data Humans Interprofessional Relations London Male Medical Errors/adverse effects/prevention & control/*statistics & numerical data Middle Aged *Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care) Patient Safety Postoperative Care/adverse effects/methods/*standards/statistics & numerical data Prospective Studies *Surgical Procedures, Elective"

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the relation of n-3 FAs with HF in US male physicians. DESIGN: We used nested case-control (n = 1572) and prospective cohort study designs (n = 19,097). Plasma phospholipid n-3 FAs were measured by using gas chromatography, and food-frequency questionnaires were used to assess dietary n-3 FAs and fish intake. Incident HF was ascertained via annual follow-up questionnaires and validated in a subsample. RESULTS: The mean age was 58.7 y at blood collection. In a multivariable model, plasma alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) was associated with a lower risk of HF in a nonlinear fashion (P-quadratic trend = 0.02), and the lowest OR was observed in quintile 4 (0.66; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.94). Plasma EPA and DHA were not associated with HF, whereas plasma docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) showed a nonlinear inverse relation with HF for quintile 2 (OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.79). Dietary marine n-3 FAs showed a trend toward a lower risk of HF in quintile 4 (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.02) and a nonlinear pattern across quintiles. Fish intake was associated with a lower risk of HF, with RRs of ~0.70 for all categories of fish consumption greater than one serving per month. CONCLUSIONS: Our data are consistent with an inverse and nonlinear relation of plasma phospholipid ALA and DPA, but not EPA or DHA, with HF risk. Fish consumption greater than once per month was associated with a lower HF risk.","Aged Animals Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies Diet/adverse effects Double-Blind Method Fatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage/*blood/therapeutic use Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/administration & dosage/blood/therapeutic use Female *Fishes Follow-Up Studies Heart Failure/blood/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Physicians Risk *Seafood/analysis United States/epidemiology alpha-Linolenic Acid/administration & dosage/blood/therapeutic use"
23027170,Long-term outcomes of infant behavioral dysregulation.,Pediatrics,Hyde R and O'Callaghan MJ and Bor W and Williams GM and Najman JM,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether maternal report of infant behavioral dysregulation at 6 months is associated with a higher prevalence of behavioral concerns at 5, 14, and 21 years of age; and to assess the extent to which maternal and social factors may affect reported child behavior outcomes. METHODS: From the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy cohort of 7223 live singleton babies, information on dysregulation was available for 6389 children at 6 months. Of those children, behavior data were available for 4836 at 5 years by using a modified Child Behavior Checklist, 4746 at 14 years by using a full Child Behavior Checklist and Youth Self-Report, and 3558 at 21 years by using a Young Adult Self-Report. Of the youth with dysregulation data at 6 months, 2308 completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview at 21 years. Potential confounding and mediating factors were analyzed by using logistic regression. RESULTS: Maternal-reported behavioral dysregulation at 6 months was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of maternal-reported behavior problems at 5 and 14 years (P < .001), but not youth self-reported problems at 14 or 21 years, or Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Diagnostic and Statistical Manual diagnoses at 21 years. The strength of association between infant dysregulation and maternal-reported behaviors was greater at 5 years than at 14 years, and was substantially reduced by adjusting for maternal, social, and infant factors, especially potentially the mediating factors of maternal anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Infant behavioral dysregulation was a risk factor for maternal-reported behavior concerns at 5 and 14 years, although was unrelated to young adult mental health.","Adolescent *Child Behavior Disorders/epidemiology Child, Preschool Follow-Up Studies Humans Models, Psychological Mothers Questionnaires Risk Factors Time Factors Young Adult"

We examined the association between moderate alcohol consumption and the risk of incident atrial fibrillation among older adults with existing cardiovascular disease or diabetes. METHODS: We analyzed data for 30 433 adults who participated in 2 large antihypertensive drug treatment trials and who had no atrial fibrillation at baseline. The patients were 55 years or older and had a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes with end-organ damage. We classified levels of alcohol consumption according to median cut-off values for low, moderate and high intake based on guidelines used in various countries, and we defined binge drinking as more than 5 drinks a day. The primary outcome measure was incident atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: A total of 2093 patients had incident atrial fibrillation. The age- and sex-standardized incidence rate per 1000 person-years was 14.5 among those with a low level of alcohol consumption, 17.3 among those with a moderate level and 20.8 among those with a high level. Compared with participants who had a low level of consumption, those with higher levels had an increased risk of incident atrial fibrillation (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.26, for moderate consumption; 1.32, 95% CI 0.97-1.80, for high consumption). Results were similar after we excluded binge drinkers. Among those with moderate alcohol consumption, binge drinkers had an increased risk of atrial fibrillation compared with non-binge drinkers (adjusted HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.62). INTERPRETATION: Moderate to high alcohol intake was associated with an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation among people aged 55 or older with cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Among moderate drinkers, the effect of binge drinking on the risk of atrial fibrillation was similar to that of habitual heavy drinking.",Age Distribution Aged Alcohol Drinking/blood/*epidemiology Atrial Fibrillation/diagnosis/*epidemiology Binge Drinking/blood/*epidemiology Cardiovascular Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology Comorbidity Confidence Intervals Female Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Ontario/epidemiology Proportional Hazards Models Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Risk Assessment Severity of Illness Index Sex Distribution Survival Rate

More than 3500 monogenic diseases have been characterized, but clinical testing is available for only some of them and many feature clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Hence, an immense unmet need exists for improved molecular diagnosis in infants. Because disease progression is extremely rapid, albeit heterogeneous, in newborns, molecular diagnoses must occur quickly to be relevant for clinical decision-making. We describe 50-hour differential diagnosis of genetic disorders by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) that features automated bioinformatic analysis and is intended to be a prototype for use in neonatal intensive care units. Retrospective 50-hour WGS identified known molecular diagnoses in two children. Prospective WGS disclosed potential molecular diagnosis of a severe GJB2-related skin disease in one neonate; BRAT1-related lethal neonatal rigidity and multifocal seizure syndrome in another infant; identified BCL9L as a novel, recessive visceral heterotaxy gene (HTX6) in a pedigree; and ruled out known candidate genes in one infant. Sequencing of parents or affected siblings expedited the identification of disease genes in prospective cases. Thus, rapid WGS can potentially broaden and foreshorten differential diagnosis, resulting in fewer empirical treatments and faster progression to genetic and prognostic counseling.","Genetic Diseases, Inborn/*genetics Genome, Human/*genetics Humans Infant, Newborn *Intensive Care Units, Neonatal Retrospective Studies Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods"

23007036,Body mass index following natural menopause and hysterectomy with and without bilateral oophorectomy.,Int J Obes (Lond),Gibson CJ and Thurston RC and El Khoudary SR and Sutton-Tyrrell K and Matthews KA,upmc,"OBJECTIVE: The directional and temporal nature of relationships between overweight and obesity and hysterectomy with or without oophorectomy is not well understood. Overweight and obesity may be both a risk factor for the indications for these surgeries and a possible consequence of the procedure. We used prospective data to examine whether body mass index (BMI) increased more following hysterectomy with and without bilateral oophorectomy compared with natural menopause among middle-aged women. METHODS: BMI was assessed annually for up to 10 years in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN (n=1962)). Piecewise linear mixed growth models were used to examine changes in BMI before and after natural menopause, hysterectomy with ovarian conservation and hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy. Covariates included education, race/ethnicity, menopausal status, physical activity, self-rated health, hormone therapy use, antidepressant use, age and visit before the final menstrual period (FMP; for natural menopause) or surgery (for hysterectomy/oophorectomy). RESULTS: By visit 10, 1780 (90.6%) women reached natural menopause, 106 (5.5%) reported hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy and 76 (3.9%) reported hysterectomy with ovarian conservation. In fully adjusted models, BMI increased for all women from baseline to FMP or surgery (annual rate of change=0.19 kg m(-2) per year), with no significant differences in BMI change between groups. BMI also increased for all women following FMP, but increased more rapidly in women following hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy (annual rate of change=0.21 kg m(-2) per year) as compared with following natural menopause (annual rate of change=0.08 kg m(-2) per year, P=0.03). CONCLUSION: In this prospective examination, hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy was associated with greater increases in BMI in the years following surgery than following hysterectomy with ovarian conservation or natural menopause. This suggests that accelerated weight gain follows bilateral oophorectomy among women in midlife, which may increase risk for obesity-related chronic diseases.","Adult *Body Mass Index Decision Making Female Humans Hysterectomy/*adverse effects Middle Aged Obesity/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control Ovariectomy/*adverse effects *Postmenopause Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Surgical Procedures, Elective/adverse effects United States/epidemiology *Weight Gain Women's Health"

DESIGN: A discrete-time hazard model was used to estimate time to outcome associated with exposure to four drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers (BBs), statins, and clopidogrel) used for post-AMI secondary prevention of cardiovascular events and mortality. SETTING: Medicare administrative data for a 5% random sample of beneficiaries. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare beneficiaries (N = 9,538) hospitalized for an AMI between April 1, 2006, and December 31, 2007, who survived for at least 30 days after discharge. The cohort was followed until death or December 31, 2008. MEASUREMENTS: Time-varying exposure was measured as proportion of days covered (PDC) for each quarter during the follow-up period. PDC was classified into five categories (0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, 0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, 0.8-1.0). Outcomes were mortality and a composite outcome of death or post-AMI hospitalization. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 18 months, mean PDC rates ranged from 0.37 (clopidogrel) to 0.50 (statins). When comparing the highest versus lowest categories of exposure, the hazard of the composite outcome was significantly lower for all drug classes except BBs (statins, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.71, ACEIs/ARBs, aHR = 0.81, clopidogrel, aHR = 0.85, BBs, aHR = 0.93). All four drug classes were significantly associated with reductions in mortality; the magnitude of effect for the mortality outcome was largest for statins and smallest for BBs. Age modified the effect of statins on mortality. CONCLUSION: Use of evidence-based medications for secondary prevention after AMI is suboptimal in the Medicare population, and low exposure rates are associated with significantly higher risk for subsequent hospitalization and death.","Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/adverse effects Aged Aged, 80 and over Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/adverse effects Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects Chemoprevention/adverse effects Evidence-Based Practice Female Humans Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/adverse effects Male Middle Aged Myocardial Infarction/*drug therapy/*prevention & control Secondary Prevention Ticlopidine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives Treatment Outcome"
22755552,The effects of chronic periodontitis and its treatment on the subsequent risk of psoriasis.,Br J Dermatol,Keller JJ and Lin HC,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Although psoriasis and chronic periodontitis (CP) may share an underlying immune dysregulation as part of their pathologies, to date only one small-scale cross-sectional pilot study has investigated the potential association between CP and psoriasis. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the subsequent risk for psoriasis following a diagnosis of CP by utilizing a cohort study design and population-based dataset in Taiwan. METHODS: In total, 115 365 patients with CP were included in the study cohort and 115 365 patients without CP were included in the comparison cohort. We individually tracked each patient for a 5-year period to identify those who had subsequently received a diagnosis of psoriasis. A Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to compute the 5-year risk of subsequent psoriasis following a diagnosis of CP. RESULTS: We found that the incidence rate of psoriasis during the 5-year follow-up period was 1.88 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.77-1.99] per 1000 person-years in patients with CP and 1.22 (95% CI 1.14-1.32) per 1000 person-years in comparison patients. After censoring those who died during the follow-up period, and adjusting for monthly income and geographical region, compared with comparison patients, the hazard ratio (HR) of psoriasis for patients with CP was 1.52 (95% CI 1.38-1.70). Furthermore, the study subjects who had undergone a gingivectomy or periodontal flap operation had only a slightly higher adjusted risk of psoriasis than comparison patients (HR 1.26). CONCLUSIONS: This study detected an increased risk for psoriasis among patients with CP. Treatment for CP attenuated, but did not nullify, the risk for subsequent psoriasis.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Chronic Periodontitis/*epidemiology/surgery Cohort Studies Female Humans Male Middle Aged Oral Surgical Procedures Proportional Hazards Models Psoriasis/*epidemiology Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Surgical Flaps Taiwan/epidemiology Young Adult"
22989176,"Does parkland influence walking? The relationship between area of parkland and walking trips in Melbourne, Australia.",Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,King TL and Thornton LE and Bentley RJ and Kavanagh AM,unimelb,"BACKGROUND: Using two different measures of park area, at three buffer distances, we sought to investigate the ways in which park area and proximity to parks, are related to the frequency of walking (for all purposes) in Australian adults. Little previous research has been conducted in this area, and results of existing research have been mixed. METHODS: Residents of 50 urban areas in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia completed a physical activity survey (n = 2305). Respondents reported how often they walked for >/=10 minutes in the previous month. Walking frequency was dichotomised to 'less than weekly' (less than 1/week) and 'at least weekly' (1/week or more). Using Geographic Information Systems, Euclidean buffers were created around each respondent's home at three distances: 400metres (m), 800 m and 1200 m. Total area of parkland in each person's buffer was calculated for the three buffers. Additionally, total area of 'larger parks', (park space >/= park with Australian Rules Football oval (17,862 m2)), was calculated for each set of buffers. Area of park was categorised into tertiles for area of all parks, and area of larger parks (the lowest tertile was used as the reference category). Multilevel logistic regression, with individuals nested within areas, was used to estimate the effect of area of parkland on walking frequency. RESULTS: No statistically significant associations were found between walking frequency and park area (total and large parks) within 400 m of respondent's homes. For total park area within 800 m, the odds of walking at least weekly were lower for those in the mid (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.91) and highest (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.95) tertile of park area compared to those living in areas with the least amount of park area. Similar results were observed for total park area in the 1200 m buffers. When only larger parks were investigated, again more frequent walking was less likely when respondents had access to a greater amount of park area. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found that more park area in residential environments reduced the odds of walking more frequently. Other area characteristics such as street connectivity and destinations may underlie these associations by negatively correlating with park area.",Adolescent Adult Aged Australia Cross-Sectional Studies *Environment Design Exercise/psychology Female Geographic Information Systems Health Behavior Humans Male Middle Aged Public Facilities/*statistics & numerical data Recreation/*psychology Urban Population/statistics & numerical data *Walking/psychology/statistics & numerical data Young Adult

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to quantify weight loss and dropout during a commercial weight-loss program in Sweden (Itrim; cost: $1300/euro1000; all participants paid their own fee). DESIGN: This observational cohort study linked commercial weight-loss data with National Health Care Registers. Weight loss was induced with a 500-kcal liquid-formula VLCD [n = 3773; BMI (in kg/m(2)): 34 +/- 5 (mean +/- SD); 80% women; 45 +/- 12 y of age (mean +/- SD)], a 1200-1500-kcal formula and food-combination LCD (n = 4588; BMI: 30 +/- 4; 86% women; 50 +/- 11 y of age), and a 1500-1800-kcal/d restricted normal-food diet (n = 676; BMI: 29 +/- 5; 81% women; 51 +/- 12 y of age). Maintenance strategies included exercise and a calorie-restricted diet. Weight loss was analyzed by using an intention-to-treat analysis (baseline substitution). RESULTS: After 1 y, mean (+/-SD) weight changes were -11.4 +/- 9.1 kg with the VLCD (18% dropout), -6.8 +/- 6.4 kg with the LCD (23% dropout), and -5.1 +/- 5.9 kg with the restricted normal-food diet (26% dropout). In an adjusted analysis, the VLCD group lost 2.8 kg (95% CI: 2.5, 3.2) and 3.8 kg (95% CI: 3.2, 4.5) more than did the LCD and restricted normal-food groups, respectively. A high baseline BMI and rapid initial weight loss were both independently associated with greater 1-y weight loss (P < 0.001). Younger age and low initial weight loss predicted an increased dropout rate (P < 0.001). Treatment of depression (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.9) and psychosis (OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.1, 6.3) were associated with an increased dropout rate in the VLCD group. CONCLUSION: A commercial weight-loss program, particularly one using a VLCD, was effective at reducing body weight in self-selected, self-paying adults.","Adult Body Mass Index Cohort Studies Diet, Reducing/*methods/standards Female Humans Male Middle Aged Obesity/*diet therapy Patient Dropouts Sweden *Weight Loss Weight Reduction Programs/*methods/standards"
22997217,Water-based exercise in COPD with physical comorbidities: a randomised controlled trial.,Eur Respir J,McNamara RJ and McKeough ZJ and McKenzie DK and Alison JA,nsw,"Land-based exercise is often difficult for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have coexisting obesity or musculoskeletal or neurological conditions. This randomised controlled trial aimed to determine the effectiveness of water-based exercise training in improving exercise capacity and quality of life compared to land-based exercise training and control (no exercise) in people with COPD and physical comorbidities. Participants referred to pulmonary rehabilitation were randomly allocated to a water-based exercise, land-based exercise or the control group. The two exercise groups trained for 8 weeks, completing three sessions per week. 45 out of 53 participants (mean +/- SD age 72 +/- 9 years; forced expiratory volume in 1 s 59 +/- 15% predicted) completed the study. Compared to controls, water-based exercise training significantly increased 6-min walking distance, incremental and endurance shuttle walk distances, and improved Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRDQ) dyspnoea and fatigue. Compared to land-based exercise training, water-based exercise training significantly increased incremental shuttle walk distance (mean difference 39 m, 95% CI 5-72 m), endurance shuttle walk distance (mean difference 228 m, 95% CI 19-438 m) and improved CRDQ fatigue. Water-based exercise training was significantly more effective than land-based exercise training and control in increasing peak and endurance exercise capacity and improving aspects of quality of life in people with COPD and physical comorbidities.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Disabled Persons Exercise Therapy/*methods Female Humans Male Middle Aged Musculoskeletal Diseases/complications/rehabilitation Nervous System Diseases/complications/rehabilitation Obesity/complications/rehabilitation Patient Compliance Prospective Studies Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/complications/*physiopathology/*rehabilitation Quality of Life Questionnaires Respiratory Function Tests Sports Treatment Outcome Walking *Water"
23007039,The effect of high ambient temperature on emergency room visits.,Epidemiology,Basu R and Pearson D and Malig B and Broadwin R and Green R,ca,"BACKGROUND: The association between temperature and mortality has been widely researched, although the association between temperature and morbidity has been less studied. We examined the association between mean daily apparent temperature and emergency room (ER) visits in California. METHODS: We used a time-stratified case-crossover design, restricting our data to the warm seasons of 2005-2008 in 16 climate zones. The study population included cases residing within 10 km of meteorologic monitors. Conditional logistic regression models with apparent temperature were applied by climate zone; these models were then combined in meta-analyses to estimate overall effects. Our analyses considered the effects by disease subgroup, race/ethnic group, age group, and potential confounding by air pollutants. RESULTS: More than 1.2 million ER visits were included. Positive associations were found for same-day apparent temperature and ischemic heart disease (% excess risk per 10 degrees F = 1.7 [95% confidence interval = 0.2 to 3.3]), ischemic stroke (2.8 [0.9 to 4.7]), cardiac dysrhythmia (2.8 [0.9 to 4.9]), hypotension (12.7 [8.3 to 17.4]), diabetes (4.3 [2.8 to 5.9]), intestinal infection (6.1 [3.3 to 9.0]), dehydration (25.6 [21.9 to 29.4]), acute renal failure (15.9 [12.7 to 19.3]), and heat illness (393.3 [331.2 to 464.5]). Negative associations were found for aneurysm, hemorrhagic stroke, and hypertension. Most of these estimates remained relatively unchanged after adjusting for air pollutants. Risks often varied by age or racial/ethnic group. CONCLUSIONS: Increased temperatures were found to have same-day effects on ER admission for several outcomes.

We analysed blood mRNA expression arrays to identify patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with poorer outcome. METHODS: Whole blood was collected into PAXgene tubes from patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and patients with prostate cancer selected for active surveillance. In stage I (derivation set), patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer were used as cases and patients under active surveillance were used as controls. These patients were recruited from The Royal Marsden Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (Sutton, UK) and The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre (Glasgow, UK). In stage II (validation-set), patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer recruited from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York, USA) were assessed. Whole-blood RNA was hybridised to Affymetrix U133plus2 microarrays. Expression profiles were analysed with Bayesian latent process decomposition (LPD) to identify RNA expression profiles associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer subgroups; these profiles were then confirmed by quantative reverse transcriptase (qRT) PCR studies and correlated with overall survival in both the test-set and validation-set. FINDINGS: LPD analyses of the mRNA expression data divided the evaluable patients in stage I (n=94) into four groups. All patients in LPD1 (14 of 14) and most in LPD2 (17 of 18) had castration-resistant prostate cancer. Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and those under active surveillance comprised LPD3 (15 of 31 castration-resistant prostate cancer) and LDP4 (12 of 21 castration-resistant prostate cancer). Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer in the LPD1 subgroup had features associated with worse prognosis and poorer overall survival than patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer in other LPD subgroups (LPD1 overall survival 10.7 months [95% CI 4.1-17.2] vs non-LPD1 25.6 months [18.0-33.4]; p<0.0001). A nine-gene signature verified by qRT-PCR classified patients into this LPD1 subgroup with a very low percentage of misclassification (1.2%). The ten patients who were initially unclassifiable by the LPD analyses were subclassified by this signature. We confirmed the prognostic utility of this nine-gene signature in the validation castration-resistant prostate cancer cohort, where LPD1 membership was also associated with worse overall survival (LPD1 9.2 months [95% CI 2.1-16.4] vs non-LPD1 21.6 months [7.5-35.6]; p=0.001), and remained an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analyses for both cohorts.

Women may have more atypical ACS symptoms compared to men, but few data are available on differences in gender and ACS symptoms in calling 911. In this study, patient interviews and structured chart reviews were conducted to determine gender differences in calling 911. Calls to 911 were assessed by self-report and validated by medical chart review. Of the 476 patients studied, 292 (61%) were diagnosed with unstable angina and 184 (39%) with myocardial infarctions (MIs). Overall, only 23% of patients called 911. Similar percentages of women and men with unstable angina called 911 (15% and 13%, respectively, p = 0.59). In contrast, women with MIs were significantly more likely to call 911 than men (57% vs 28%, p <0.001). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, health insurance status, history of MI, the left ventricular ejection fraction, Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score, and ACS symptoms, women were 1.79 times more likely to call 911 during an MI than men (prevalence ratio 1.79, 95% confidence interval 1.22 to 2.64, p <0.01).

Several research groups have assessed normothermic perfusion of donor lungs but all devices investigated were non-portable. We report first-in-man experience of the portable Organ Care System (OCS) Lung device for concomitant preservation, assessment, and transport of donor lungs. METHODS: Between Feb 18, and July 1, 2011, 12 patients were transplanted at two academic lung transplantation centres in Hanover, Germany and Madrid, Spain. Lungs were perfused with low-potassium dextran solution, explanted, immediately connected to the OCS Lung, perfused with Steen's solution supplemented with two red-cell concentrates. We assessed donor and recipient characteristics and monitored extended criteria donor lung scores; primary graft dysfunction scores at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h; time on mechanical ventilation after surgery; length of stays in hospital and the intensive-care unit after surgery; blood gases; and survival of grafts and patients. FINDINGS: Eight donors were female and four were male (mean age 44.5 years, range 14-72). Seven recipients were female and five were male (mean age 50.0 years, range 31-59). The preharvest donor ratio of partial pressure of oxyen (PaO(2)) to fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (F(I)O(2)) was 463.9 (SD 91.4). The final ratio of PaO(2) to F(I)O(2) measured with the OCS Lung was 471.58 (127.9). The difference between these ratios was not significant (p=0.72). All grafts and patients survived to 30 days; all recipients recovered and were discharged from hospital. INTERPRETATION: Lungs can be safely preserved with the OCS Lung, resulting in complete organ use and successful transplantation in our series of high-risk recipients. In November, 2011, we began recruitment for a prospective, randomised, multicentre trial (INSPIRE) to compare preservation with OCS Lung with standard cold storage.

The aim of this study was to examine temporal trends in HIV mortality by sex, race/ethnicity, and individual level of education (as a proxy for socioeconomic status). METHODS: We examined HIV deaths among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic men and women aged 25 to 64 years in 26 states (1993-2007; N=91 307) reported to the National Vital Statistics System. The main outcome measures were age-standardized HIV death rates, rate differences, and rate ratios by educational attainment and between the least- and the most-educated (</=12 vs >/=16 years) individuals. RESULTS: Between 1993-1995 and 2005-2007, mortality declined for most men and women by race/ethnicity and educational levels, with the greatest absolute decreases for nonwhites owing to their higher baseline rates. Among men with the most education, rates per 100 000 population decreased from 117.89 (95% CI, 101.08-134.70) to 15.35 (12.08-18.62) in blacks vs from 26.42 (24.93-27.92) to 1.79 (1.50-2.08) in whites. Rates were unchanged for the least-educated black women (26.76; 95% CI, 24.30-29.23; during 2005-2007) and remained high for similarly educated black men (52.71; 48.96-56.45). Relative declines were greater with increasing levels of education (P < .001), resulting in widening disparities. Among men, the disparity rate ratio (comparing the least and the most educated) increased from 1.04 (95% CI, 0.89-1.21) during 1993-1995 to 3.43 (2.74-4.30) during 2005-2007 for blacks and from 0.98 (0.91-1.05) to 2.82 (2.34-3.40) for whites. CONCLUSION: Although absolute declines in HIV mortality were greatest for nonwhites, rates remain high among blacks, especially in the lowest educated groups, underscoring the need for additional interventions.",Adult Age Distribution Cause of Death *Continental Population Groups Educational Status *Ethnic Groups Female *HIV HIV Infections/*ethnology/*mortality Humans Male Middle Aged Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Sex Distribution Socioeconomic Factors Survival Rate/trends United States
23036983,Association between organic dietary choice during pregnancy and hypospadias in offspring: a study of mothers of 306 boys operated on for hypospadias.,J Urol,Christensen JS and Asklund C and Skakkebaek NE and Jorgensen N and Andersen HR and Jorgensen TM and Olsen LH and Hoyer AP and Moesgaard J and Thorup J and Jensen TK,Missing,"PURPOSE: The etiology of hypospadias is poorly understood. Exposure to pesticides has been considered a risk factor, although findings are inconsistent. Diet constitutes a significant exposure route for pesticides, and pesticide residues are more frequently reported in conventional than organic food products. We examined the association between organic dietary choice during pregnancy and presence of hypospadias in the offspring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mothers of 306 boys operated on for hypospadias were frequency matched for geography and child birth year to 306 mothers of healthy boys in a case-control study. Telephone interviews were conducted regarding demographic and lifestyle factors, including intake and organic choice of selected food items (milk, dairy products, egg, fruit, vegetables and meat). Logistic regression models were constructed for dietary variables, and odds ratios were calculated controlling for maternal age, body mass index and alcohol consumption. RESULTS: Overall organic choice of food items during pregnancy was not associated with hypospadias in the offspring. However, frequent current consumption of high fat dairy products (milk, butter) while rarely or never choosing the organic alternative to these products during pregnancy was associated with increased odds of hypospadias (adjusted OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.09-4.36). CONCLUSIONS: This large case-control study of boys operated on for hypospadias suggests an association between hypospadias in the offspring and the mother not choosing the organic alternative, and having a high current intake of nonorganic butter and cheese. This finding could be due to chemical contamination of high fat dairy products. However, general lifestyle and health behavior related to choosing organic alternatives may also explain the finding.","Denmark/epidemiology Diet/*adverse effects Female Humans Hypospadias/epidemiology/*etiology/surgery Incidence Infant, Newborn *Life Style Male Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects Odds Ratio Pregnancy Questionnaires Risk Factors Urologic Surgical Procedures, Male/*methods"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with breast cancer reporting treatment-induced menopausal symptoms (N=422) were randomly assigned to CBT (n=109), PE (n=104), CBT/PE (n=106), or to a waiting list control group (n=103). Self-report questionnaires were completed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months. Multilevel procedures were used to compare the intervention groups with the control group over time. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the intervention groups had a significant decrease in levels of endocrine symptoms (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms; P<.001; effect size, 0.31-0.52) and urinary symptoms (Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Questionnaire; P=.002; effect size, 0.29-0.33), and they showed an improvement in physical functioning (36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical functioning subscale; P=.002; effect size, 0.37-0.46). The groups that included CBT also showed a significant decrease in the perceived burden of hot flashes and night sweats (problem rating scale of the Hot Flush Rating Scale; P<.001; effect size, 0.39-0.56) and an increase in sexual activity (Sexual Activity Questionnaire habit subscale; P=.027; effect size, 0.65). Most of these effects were observed at both the 12-week and 6-month follow-ups. CONCLUSION: CBT and PE can have salutary effects on endocrine symptoms and, to a lesser degree, on sexuality and physical functioning of patients with breast cancer experiencing treatment-induced menopause.

23045557,Drug shortage-associated increase in catheter-related blood stream infection in children.,Pediatrics,Ralls MW and Blackwood RA and Arnold MA and Partipilo ML and Dimond J and Teitelbaum DH,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Ethanol lock therapy (ELT) has been shown to reduce the incidence of catheter-related blood stream infections (CRBSI) in intestinal failure (IF) patients. Dosing and frequency remains undefined. Scrutiny of pharmaceutical facilities by the Food and Drug Administration led to the voluntary shutdown of the sole supplier of ethanol, resulting in a nationwide shortage. To conserve supply, we reduced ELT frequency from a daily regimen. We examined the impact that reduction in ELT frequency had on CRBSI in pediatric IF patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our parenteral nutrition-dependent IF children. Primary outcome measure was CRBSI per 1000 catheter days after ELT frequency reduction. Data were compared (paired t test) to the same group over 1 year before ethanol shortage and to historical controls. RESULTS: During the shortage 13 outpatients received ELT. Eight met study criteria. Mean +/- SD age was 9.1 +/- 7.8 years. Mean CRBSI rate per 1000 catheter days was 0.7 +/- 1.3 before ELT shortage. This increased to 6.2 +/- 2.5 after frequency reduction (P < .001). This CRBSI rate was similar to historical IF children not on ELT (8.0 +/- 5.4). Seven children developed CRBSI after frequency reduction, 6 requiring hospitalization, 2 to the ICU. Mean length of stay (15.5 days) averaged $104,783(+/- 111,034) in hospital charges. Organisms included Gram-negatives (6), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (1), and Candida spp (1). CONCLUSIONS: ELT frequency reduction resulted in complete failure in CRBSI prophylaxis.

METHODS: The study included patients who participated in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's NSCLC Database Project. Current, former, and never smokers were compared with respect to overall survival by fitting Cox regression models. RESULTS: Data from 4200 patients were examined, including 618 never smokers, 1483 current smokers, 380 former smokers who quit 1 to 12 months before diagnosis, and 1719 former smokers who quit >12 months before diagnosis. Among patients with stage I, II, and III disease, only never smokers had better survival than current smokers (hazard ratio, 0.47 [95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.85] vs 0.51 [95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.68], respectively). Among patients with stage IV disease, the impact of smoking depended on age: Among younger patients (aged </=55 years), being a never smoker and a former smoker for >/=12 months increased survival. After age 85 years, smoking status did not have a significant impact on overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who were smoking at the time of diagnosis had worse survival compared with never smokers. Among younger patients with stage IV disease, current smokers also had worse survival compared with former smokers who quit >12 months before diagnosis. It is likely that tumor biology plays a major role in the differences observed; however, to improve survival, it is prudent to encourage all smokers to quit smoking if they are diagnosed with NSCLC.","Aged Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*mortality/pathology Cohort Studies Female Humans Lung Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology Male Middle Aged Prognosis Proportional Hazards Models Smoking/*adverse effects Survival Analysis United States"
23011902,Predictors of newly diagnosed cancer patients' understanding of the goals of their care at initiation of chemotherapy.,Cancer,Lennes IT and Temel JS and Hoedt C and Meilleur A and Lamont EB,partners,"BACKGROUND: The American Society of Clinical Oncology Quality Oncology Practice Initiative endorses in their core measures that providers should discuss the goals of care (GOC) at the time of chemotherapy consent. GOC refers to chemotherapy treatment intent: cure versus noncure. In this study, the authors sought to determine whether attributes of patients and initial patient-physician encounters were associated with patients' understanding of their GOC. METHODS: In total, the authors surveyed 125 consecutive, newly diagnosed patients who were receiving chemotherapy for solid malignancies at a single academic cancer center and performed a medical record review for additional data. Patient understanding of their oncologist's GOC and oncologist's reported GOC were compared. The primary outcome was concordance of patient-physician dyads regarding the GOC (cure vs noncure). RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five of 137 of eligible patients (91%) completed the survey. Only 95 of 125 patient-physician pairs (75%) patient-physician pairs were concordant regarding the GOC. In a multivariable logistic regression, both older patients (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.57) and non-native English speakers had an almost 80% lower odds (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.93) of GOC concordance compared with younger patients and native English speakers. Patients who received printed chemotherapy information during the patient-physician consent process had almost 3 times greater odds (odds ratio, 2.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-6.68) of GOC concordance with their physician compared with those who did not receive materials. CONCLUSIONS: Patient misunderstanding of GOC was substantial, with 25% of cancer patients misunderstanding the goal of their chemotherapy treatment. Key predictors of GOC misunderstanding included factors that potentially were amenable to interventions at the time of chemotherapy consent.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use *Comprehension/physiology Female Forecasting Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Humans Male Middle Aged Neoadjuvant Therapy Neoplasms/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*psychology *Patient Care Planning Retrospective Studies Self Concept Socioeconomic Factors"
23045582,Unintended consequences of health information technology: evidence from veterans affairs colorectal cancer oncology watch intervention.,J Clin Oncol,Bian J and Bennett CL and Fisher DA and Ribeiro M and Lipscomb J,sc,"PURPOSE: We evaluated the Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Oncology Watch intervention, a clinical reminder implemented in Veterans Integrated Service Network 7 (including eight hospitals) to improve CRC screening rates in 2008. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative data were used to construct four cross-sectional groups of veterans at average risk, age 50 to 64 years; one group was created for each of the following years: 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2010. We applied hospital fixed effects for estimation, using a difference-in-differences model in which the eight hospitals served as the intervention sites, and the other 121 hospitals served as controls, with 2006 to 2007 as the preintervention period and 2009 to 2010 as the postintervention period. RESULTS: The sample included 4,352,082 veteran-years in the 4 years. The adherence rates were 37.6%, 31.6%, 34.4%, and 33.2% in the intervention sites in 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2010, respectively, and the corresponding rates in the controls were 31.0%, 30.3%, 32.3%, and 30.9%. Regression analysis showed that among those eligible for screening, the intervention was associated with a 2.2-percentage point decrease in likelihood of adherence (P < .001). Additional analyses showed that the intervention was associated with a 5.6-percentage point decrease in likelihood of screening colonoscopy among the adherent, but with increased total colonoscopies (all indicators) of 3.6 per 100 veterans age 50 to 64 years. CONCLUSION: The intervention had little impact on CRC screening rates for the studied population. This absence of favorable impact may have been caused by an unintentional shift of limited VA colonoscopy capacity from average-risk screening to higher-risk screening and to CRC surveillance, or by physician fatigue resulting from the large number of clinical reminders implemented in the VA.",*Colonoscopy Colorectal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*prevention & control *Early Detection of Cancer Female Humans Linear Models Male *Mass Screening/methods/statistics & numerical data *Medical Informatics Middle Aged Quality of Health Care United States/epidemiology United States Department of Veterans Affairs
23023818,Cherry consumption and decreased risk of recurrent gout attacks.,Arthritis Rheum,Zhang Y and Neogi T and Chen C and Chaisson C and Hunter DJ and Choi HK,bu,"OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between cherry intake and the risk of recurrent gout attacks among individuals with gout. METHODS: We conducted a case-crossover study to examine the associations of a set of putative risk factors with recurrent gout attacks. Individuals with gout were prospectively recruited and followed up online for 1 year. Participants were asked to provide the following information regarding gout attacks: the onset date of the gout attack, symptoms and signs, medications (including antigout medications), and exposure to potential risk factors (including daily intake of cherries and cherry extract) during the 2-day period prior to the gout attack. We assessed the same exposure information over 2-day control periods. We estimated the risk of recurrent gout attacks related to cherry intake using conditional logistic regression. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Our study included 633 individuals with gout. Cherry intake over a 2-day period was associated with a 35% lower risk of gout attacks compared with no intake (multivariate OR 0.65 [95% CI 0.50-0.85]). Cherry extract intake showed a similar inverse association (multivariate OR 0.55 [95% CI 0.30-0.98]). The effect of cherry intake persisted across subgroups stratified by sex, obesity status, purine intake, alcohol use, diuretic use, and use of antigout medications. When cherry intake was combined with allopurinol use, the risk of gout attacks was 75% lower than during periods without either exposure (OR 0.25 [95% CI 0.15-0.42]). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that cherry intake is associated with a lower risk of gout attacks.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Alcohol Drinking/epidemiology Comorbidity Cross-Over Studies *Eating Female Follow-Up Studies Gout/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*prevention & control Gout Suppressants/therapeutic use Humans Male Middle Aged Obesity/epidemiology Prospective Studies *Prunus Recurrence Risk Factors Sex Factors"
23147981,"Pediatric providers' self-reported knowledge, practices, and attitudes about concussion.",Pediatrics,Zonfrillo MR and Master CL and Grady MF and Winston FK and Callahan JM and Arbogast KB,chop,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the self-reported practices and attitudes surrounding concussion diagnosis and management in a single, large pediatric care network. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to pediatric primary care and emergency medicine providers in a single, large pediatric care network. For all survey participants, practices and attitudes about concussion diagnosis and treatment were queried. RESULTS: There were 145 responses from 276 eligible providers, resulting in a 53% response rate, of which 91% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 86%-95%) had cared for at least 1 concussion patient in the previous 3 months. A Likert scale from 1 ""not a barrier"" to 5 ""significant barrier"" was used to assess providers' barriers to educating families about the diagnosis of concussion. Providers selected 4 or 5 on the scale for the following barriers and frequencies: inadequate training to educate 16% (95% CI: 11%-23%), inadequate time to educate 15% (95% CI: 12%-24%), and not my role to educate 1% (95% CI: 0.4%-5%). Ninety-six percent (95% CI: 91%-98%) of providers without a provider decision support tool (such as a clinical pathway or protocol) specific to concussion, and 100% (95% CI: 94%-100%) of providers without discharge instructions specific to concussion believed these resources would be helpful. CONCLUSIONS: Although pediatric primary care and emergency medicine providers regularly care for concussion patients, they may not have adequate training or infrastructure to systematically diagnose and manage these patients. Specific provider education, decision support tools, and patient information could help enhance and standardize concussion management.","*Attitude of Health Personnel Brain Concussion/*diagnosis/*therapy Brain Injury, Chronic/diagnosis/therapy Caregivers/education Child *Clinical Competence Cooperative Behavior Cross-Sectional Studies Decision Support Techniques Emergency Medical Services Evidence-Based Medicine *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Humans Interdisciplinary Communication Patient Care Team *Pediatrics Primary Health Care Quality Assurance, Health Care Referral and Consultation"

Recurrences are not uncommon, and although they are usually attributed to reinfection rather than relapse of the original infection, this remains somewhat controversial. We used molecular typing of Borrelia burgdorferi isolates obtained from patients with culture-confirmed episodes of erythema migrans to distinguish between relapse and reinfection. METHODS: We determined the genotype of the gene encoding outer-surface protein C (ospC) of B. burgdorferi strains detected in cultures of skin or blood specimens obtained from patients with consecutive episodes of erythema migrans. After polymerase-chain-reaction amplification, ospC genotyping was performed by means of reverse line-blot analysis or DNA sequencing of the nearly full-length gene. Most strains were further analyzed by determining the genotype according to the 16S-23S ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer type, multilocus sequence typing, or both. Patients received standard courses of antibiotics for erythema migrans. RESULTS: B. burgdorferi isolates obtained from 17 patients who received a diagnosis of erythema migrans between 1991 and 2011 and who had 22 paired episodes of this lesion (initial and second episodes) were available for testing. The ospC genotype was found to be different at each initial and second episode. Apparently identical genotypes were identified on more than one occasion in only one patient, at the first and third episodes, 5 years apart, but different genotypes were identified at the second and fourth episodes. CONCLUSIONS: None of the 22 paired consecutive episodes of erythema migrans were associated with the same strain of B. burgdorferi on culture. Our data show that repeat episodes of erythema migrans in appropriately treated patients were due to reinfection and not relapse.

Warmer temperatures accelerate growth and reproduction of ectotherms, whereas these processes are slowed or halted in colder temperatures. Female blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus inhabiting the Chesapeake Bay, exhibit a seasonal migratory behavior that is closely tied with spawning and the release of larvae. To better understand reproductive activities of the migratory adult females, we examined two reproductive parameters of these crabs sampled monthly (April-December, 2006): the levels of vitellogenin (VtG) in the hemolymph and VtG expression in the hepatopancreas and ovary. The full-length cDNA of VtG (CasVtG-ova) has been isolated from the ovary. The putative CasVtG sequence found in the ovary is >99% identical to that of the hepatopancreas and is related most closely to the sequences reported in other crab species. In female C. sapidus, the hepatopancreas produces over 99% of the total VtG toward the ovarian development. Ovarian stages 2 and 3 in the sampled females are characterized by significant high levels of VtG in hemolymph and VtG expression in both the hepatopancreas and ovary. However, during the southbound migration in fall, females at ovarian stages 2 and 3 have decreased VtG levels, compared to those in spring and summer. The decreased vitellogenesis activity during the fall migration suggests seasonal adaptation to ensure successful spawning and the larval release.",Missing

Here we present the assembly and analysis of the genome sequence of a female domestic Duroc pig (Sus scrofa) and a comparison with the genomes of wild and domestic pigs from Europe and Asia. Wild pigs emerged in South East Asia and subsequently spread across Eurasia. Our results reveal a deep phylogenetic split between European and Asian wild boars approximately 1 million years ago, and a selective sweep analysis indicates selection on genes involved in RNA processing and regulation. Genes associated with immune response and olfaction exhibit fast evolution. Pigs have the largest repertoire of functional olfactory receptor genes, reflecting the importance of smell in this scavenging animal. The pig genome sequence provides an important resource for further improvements of this important livestock species, and our identification of many putative disease-causing variants extends the potential of the pig as a biomedical model.","Animals Demography Genome/*genetics Models, Animal Molecular Sequence Data *Phylogeny Population Dynamics Sus scrofa/*classification/*genetics"
23149525,Patients' expectations of screening and preventive treatments.,Ann Fam Med,Hudson B and Zarifeh A and Young L and Wells JE,Missing,"PURPOSE: An informed decision to accept a health care intervention requires an understanding of its likely benefit. This study assessed participants' estimates of the benefit, as well as minimum acceptable benefit, of screening for breast and bowel cancer and medication to prevent hip fracture and cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Three general practitioners sent questionnaires to all registered patients aged 50 to 70 years. Patients agreeing to participate in the study were asked to estimate the number of events (fractures or deaths) prevented in a group of 5,000 patients undergoing each intervention over a period of 10 years, and to indicate the minimum number of events avoided by the intervention that they considered justified its use. The proportions of participants that overestimated each intervention's benefit were calculated, and univariate and multivariable analyses of predictors of response were performed. RESULTS: The participation rate was 36%: 977 patients were invited to participate in the study, and 354 returned a completed questionnaire. Participants overestimated the degree of benefit conferred by all interventions: 90% of participants overestimated the effect of breast cancer screening, 94% overestimated the effect of bowel cancer screening, 82% overestimated the effect of hip fracture preventive medication, and 69% overestimated the effect of preventive medication for cardiovascular disease. Estimates of minimum acceptable benefit were more conservative, but other than for cardiovascular disease mortality prevention, most respondents indicated a minimum benefit greater than these interventions achieve. A lower level of education was associated with higher estimates of minimum acceptable benefit for all interventions. CONCLUSION: Patients overestimated the risk reduction achieved with 4 examples of screening and preventive medications. A lower level of education was associated with higher minimum benefit to justify intervention use. This tendency to overestimate benefits may affect patients' decisions to use such interventions, and practitioners should be aware of this tendency when discussing these interventions with patients.",Aged Cardiovascular Diseases/*prevention & control Early Detection of Cancer/*methods Female *Health Promotion Hip Fractures/*prevention & control Humans Male Mass Screening/*methods Middle Aged *Patient Satisfaction Preventive Health Services/*methods Questionnaires Risk Reduction Behavior
23152233,Exercise for the management of cancer-related fatigue in adults.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Cramp F and Byron-Daniel J,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue is recognised as an important symptom associated with cancer and its treatment. A number of studies have investigated the effects of physical activity in reducing cancer-related fatigue. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in The Cochrane Library (2008, Issue 1). The original review identified some benefits of physical activity on fatigue in cancer both during and after adjuvant treatment. We identified a number of limitations in the evidence, providing clear justification for an updated review. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of exercise on cancer-related fatigue both during and after cancer treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 1, 2011), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2011), EMBASE (1980 to March 2011), CINAHL (1982 to March 2011), British Nursing Index (January 1984 to March 2011), AMED (1985 to March 2011), SIGLE (1980 to March 2011) and Dissertation Abstracts International (1861 to March 2011) using key words. We also searched reference lists off all studies identified for inclusion and relevant reviews. In addition, we handsearched relevant journals and contacted experts in the field of cancer-related fatigue. SELECTION CRITERIA: We sought and included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effect of exercise on cancer-related fatigue in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of studies and extracted data based upon predefined criteria. Where data were available we performed meta-analyses for fatigue using a random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS: For this update we identified a total of 56 studies (4068 participants) for inclusion (28 from the original search and 28 from the updated search), with the majority carried out in participants with breast cancer (28 studies). A meta-analysis of all fatigue data, incorporating 38 comparisons, provided data for 1461 participants who received an exercise intervention and 1187 control participants. At the end of the intervention period exercise was seen to be statistically more effective than the control intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.37 to -0.17). Benefits of exercise on fatigue were observed for interventions delivered during or post-adjuvant cancer therapy. In relation to diagnosis, we identified benefits of exercise on fatigue for breast and prostate cancer but not for those with haematological malignancies. Finally, aerobic exercise significantly reduced fatigue but resistance training and alternative forms of exercise failed to reach significance. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the updated review have enabled a more precise conclusion to be made in that aerobic exercise can be regarded as beneficial for individuals with cancer-related fatigue during and post-cancer therapy, specifically those with solid tumours. Further research is required to determine the optimal type, intensity and timing of an exercise intervention.",Adult *Exercise/physiology Fatigue/etiology/*therapy Female Humans Male Neoplasms/*complications/therapy Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic
23149528,Promoting safe prescribing in primary care with a contraceptive vital sign: a cluster-randomized controlled trial.,Ann Fam Med,Schwarz EB and Parisi SM and Williams SL and Shevchik GJ and Hess R,upmc,"PURPOSE: Routine assessment of women's pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use-a so-called contraceptive vital sign-may help primary care physicians identify patients who need preconception or contraceptive counseling and be of particular benefit when teratogenic medications are prescribed. METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a contraceptive vital sign on primary care documentation of contraceptive use and change in primary care physicians' provision of family planning services. Academic internists in the intervention group (n = 26) were provided with information on their female patients' pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use immediately before visits; internists in the control group (n = 27) received only standard intake information. Data were abstracted from the electronic health record for 5,371 visits by 2,304 women aged 18 to 50 years. RESULTS: Documentation of contraception increased from baseline, from 23% to 57% in the intervention group, but remained 28% in the control group, a change of +77.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.7 to 84.1) adjusted percentage points in the former vs +3.1 (95% CI, 1.2 to 5.0) in the latter (P <.001). For visits involving a teratogenic prescription, documentation increased from 14% to 48% in the intervention group and decreased from 29% to 26% in the control group, a change of +61.5 (95% CI, 35.8 to 87.1) adjusted percentage points in the former vs -0.3 (95% CI, -4.3 to 3.6) in the latter (P <.001).

23108239,Decoding twitter: Surveillance and trends for cardiac arrest and resuscitation communication.,Resuscitation,Bosley JC and Zhao NW and Hill S and Shofer FS and Asch DA and Becker LB and Merchant RM,Missing,"AIM OF THE STUDY: Twitter has over 500 million subscribers but little is known about how it is used to communicate health information. We sought to characterize how Twitter users seek and share information related to cardiac arrest, a time-sensitive cardiovascular condition where initial treatment often relies on public knowledge and response. METHODS: Tweets published April-May 2011 with keywords cardiac arrest, CPR, AED, resuscitation, heart arrest, sudden death and defib were identified. Tweets were characterized by content, dissemination, and temporal trends. Tweet authors were further characterized by: self-identified background, tweet volume, and followers. RESULTS: Of 62,163 tweets (15,324, 25%) included resuscitation/cardiac arrest-specific information. These tweets referenced specific cardiac arrest events (1130, 7%), CPR performance or AED use (6896, 44%), resuscitation-related education, research, or news media (7449, 48%), or specific questions about cardiac arrest/resuscitation (270, 2%). Regarding dissemination (1980, 13%) of messages were retweeted. Resuscitation specific tweets primarily occurred on weekdays. Most users (10,282, 93%) contributed three or fewer tweets during the study time frame. Users with more than 15 resuscitation-specific tweets in the study time frame had a mean 1787 followers and most self-identified as having a healthcare affiliation. CONCLUSION: Despite a large volume of tweets, Twitter can be filtered to identify public knowledge and information seeking and sharing about cardiac arrest. To better engage via social media, healthcare providers can distil tweets by user, content, temporal trends, and message dissemination. Further understanding of information shared by the public in this forum could suggest new approaches for improving resuscitation related education.",*Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Heart Arrest/*therapy Humans *Information Dissemination *Information Seeking Behavior Retrospective Studies Social Media/*statistics & numerical data/*trends
23149526,Projecting US primary care physician workforce needs: 2010-2025.,Ann Fam Med,Petterson SM and Liaw WR and Phillips RL Jr and Rabin DL and Meyers DS and Bazemore AW,Missing,"PURPOSE: We sought to project the number of primary care physicians required to meet US health care utilization needs through 2025 after passage of the Affordable Care Act. METHODS: In this projection of workforce needs, we used the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to calculate the use of office-based primary care in 2008. We used US Census Bureau projections to account for demographic changes and the American Medical Association's Masterfile to calculate the number of primary care physicians and determine the number of visits per physician. The main outcomes were the projected number of primary care visits through 2025 and the number of primary care physicians needed to conduct those visits. RESULTS: Driven by population growth and aging, the total number of office visits to primary care physicians is projected to increase from 462 million in 2008 to 565 million in 2025. After incorporating insurance expansion, the United States will require nearly 52,000 additional primary care physicians by 2025. Population growth will be the largest driver, accounting for 33,000 additional physicians, while 10,000 additional physicians will be needed to accommodate population aging. Insurance expansion will require more than 8,000 additional physicians, a 3% increase in the current workforce. CONCLUSIONS: Population growth will be the greatest driver of expected increases in primary care utilization. Aging and insurance expansion will also contribute to utilization, but to a smaller extent.","Delivery of Health Care/*manpower Health Services Needs and Demand/*statistics & numerical data Humans Office Visits/*statistics & numerical data Physicians, Primary Care/*supply & distribution Primary Health Care/*manpower/statistics & numerical data United States"
23122624,Prenatal exposure to nicotine and impaired reading performance.,J Pediatr,Cho K and Frijters JC and Zhang H and Miller LL and Gruen JR,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether prenatal exposure to nicotine has an impact on several reading skill outcomes in school age children. STUDY DESIGN: Using a longitudinal sample of 5119 school age children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, this study investigated specific reading skill outcomes in the area of speed, fluency, accuracy, spelling, and comprehension in relation to prenatal nicotine exposure, after adjusting for potential mediators and confounders. Prenatal nicotine exposure was divided into 3 categories: high (>17 mg per day), low (</=17 mg per day), and no exposure. RESULTS: We found that prenatal nicotine exposure was associated with increased risk of underperformance in specific reading skill outcomes after adjusting for potential mediators and confounders (P = .006). The effect of poor performance in decoding single words was most pronounced among children with prenatal exposure to high levels of nicotine in conjunction with a phonological deficit. Overall, the results showed that maternal smoking has moderate to large associations with delayed or decreased reading skills of children in the Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. CONCLUSIONS: High prenatal nicotine exposure has a negative association with reading performance in school age children. In addition, modeling showed that environmental factors significantly moderated the interaction between prenatal nicotine exposure and reading skill outcomes.",Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*diagnosis/*etiology Child Cohort Studies Dyslexia/*diagnosis/*etiology Environment Female Humans Intelligence Tests Longitudinal Studies Male Mothers Nicotine/*adverse effects Pregnancy Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*chemically induced Reading Risk Smoking/*adverse effects
23140881,Use of antibiotics during pregnancy increases the risk of asthma in early childhood.,J Pediatr,Stensballe LG and Simonsen J and Jensen SM and Bonnelykke K and Bisgaard H,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the hypothesis that mother's use of antibiotics in pregnancy could influence asthma and eczema in early life. STUDY DESIGN: Subjects were included from the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood cohort of children born of mothers with asthma (N = 411). Severe asthma exacerbations and eczema were diagnosed by research unit physicians. Replication was sought in children from the Danish National Birth Cohort (N = 30 675). Asthma outcomes were hospitalization and use of inhaled corticosteroids. Eczema was defined by an algorithm developed from cases of clinically verified eczema. All children were followed to age 5 years in a cohort study design. RESULTS: The Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood data showed increased risk of asthma exacerbation (hazard ratio 1.98 [95% CI 1.08-3.63]) if mothers had used antibiotics during third trimester. The Danish National Birth Cohort confirmed increased risk of asthma hospitalization (hazard ratio 1.17 [1.00-1.36]), and inhaled corticosteroids (1.18 [1.10-1.27]) in the children if mothers used antibiotics any time during pregnancy. In the subgroup of mothers using antibiotics for nonrespiratory infection, the children also had increased risk of asthma. CONCLUSION: We found increased risk of asthma associated with maternal antibiotic use in a clinical study of a birth cohort with increased risk of asthma and replicated this finding in an unselected national birth cohort, and in a subgroup using antibiotics for nonrespiratory infections. This supports a role for bacterial ecology in pre- or perinatal life for the development of asthma.","Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use Algorithms Anti-Bacterial Agents/*adverse effects Asthma/*etiology Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Denmark Eczema/etiology Female Hospitalization Humans Male Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/drug therapy Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects Risk Treatment Outcome"

We studied the risk of cardiovascular disease following such an outbreak in Walkerton, Ontario, in May 2000. METHODS: In this community-based cohort study, we linked data from the Walkerton Health Study (2002-2008) to Ontario's large healthcare databases. We included 4 groups of adults: 3 groups of Walkerton participants (153 with severe gastroenteritis, 414 with mild gastroenteritis, 331 with no gastroenteritis) and a group of 11 263 residents from the surrounding communities that were unaffected by the outbreak. The primary outcome was a composite of death or first major cardiovascular event (admission to hospital for acute myocardial infarction, stroke or congestive heart failure, or evidence of associated procedures). The secondary outcome was first major cardiovascular event censored for death. Adults were followed for an average of 7.4 years. RESULTS: During the study period, 1174 adults (9.7%) died or experienced a major cardiovascular event. Compared with residents of the surrounding communities, the risk of death or cardiovascular event was not elevated among Walkerton participants with severe or mild gastroenteritis (hazard ratio [HR] for severe gastroenteritis 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-1.43, mild gastroenteritis HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.98). Compared with Walkerton participants who had no gastroenteritis, risk of death or cardiovascular event was not elevated among participants with severe or mild gastroenteritis.

23401888,The cumulative effect of unemployment on risks for acute myocardial infarction.,Arch Intern Med,Dupre ME and George LK and Liu G and Peterson ED,duke,"BACKGROUND: Employment instability is a major source of strain affecting an increasing number of adults in the United States. Little is known about the cumulative effect of multiple job losses and unemployment on the risks for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: We investigated the associations between different dimensions of unemployment and the risks for AMI in US adults in a prospective cohort study of adults (N = 13,451) aged 51 to 75 years in the Health and Retirement Study with biennial follow-up interviews from 1992 to 2010. Unadjusted rates of age-specific AMI were used to demonstrate observed differences by employment status, cumulative number of job losses, and cumulative time unemployed. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the multivariate effects of cumulative work histories on AMI while adjusting for sociodemographic background and confounding risk factors. RESULTS: The median age of the study cohort was 62 years, and 1061 AMI events (7.9%) occurred during the 165,169 person-years of observation. Among the sample, 14.0% of subjects were unemployed at baseline, 69.7% had 1 or more cumulative job losses, and 35.1% had spent time unemployed. Unadjusted plots showed that age-specific rates of AMI differed significantly for each dimension of work history. Multivariate models showed that AMI risks were significantly higher among the unemployed (hazard ratio, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.10-1.66]) and that risks increased incrementally from 1 job loss (1.22 [1.04-1.42]) to 4 or more cumulative job losses (1.63 [1.29-2.07]) compared with no job loss. Risks for AMI were particularly elevated within the first year of unemployment (hazard ratio, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.01-1.60]) but not thereafter. Results were robust after adjustments for multiple clinical, socioeconomic, and behavioral risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Unemployment status, multiple job losses, and short periods without work are all significant risk factors for acute cardiovascular events.","Female Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Myocardial Infarction/*epidemiology/etiology/psychology Prognosis Proportional Hazards Models Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Stress, Psychological/*complications/epidemiology/psychology Survival Rate/trends Unemployment/*psychology United States/epidemiology"
23145957,Coitus to expedite the onset of labour: a randomised trial.,BJOG,Omar NS and Tan PC and Sabir N and Yusop ES and Omar SZ,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of suggesting coitus as a safe and effective means to expedite labour on pregnancy duration and requirement for labour induction. DESIGN: A randomised trial. SETTING: Antenatal clinic in a university hospital in Malaysia. POPULATION: Women from 35 weeks of gestation with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy. METHODS: The advise-coitus arm was counselled that coitus at term is a safe, natural and effective means to initiate labour and to avoid labour induction. The control arm was told coitus was safe. Both arms were asked to record coital activity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pregnancy duration and labour induction. RESULTS: The intervention to delivery interval (mean +/- SD) was 3.2 +/- 1.4 versus 3.3 +/- 1.3 weeks (P = 0.417), with a gestational age at delivery of 39.4 +/- 1.2 versus 39.5 +/- 1.2 weeks (P = 0.112), and with labour induction rates of 126/574 (22.0%) versus 120/576 (20.8%) (P = 0.666) for the advise-coitus and control arms, respectively, with no statistical difference between the groups. Coitus prior to delivery was more often reported in the advise-coitus arm compared with the control arm: 481/574 (85.3%) versus 458/576 (79.9%) (RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0, P = 0.019). Also, the median (interquartile range) reported number of coital acts of 3 (2-5) versus 2 (1-4) (P = 0.006) was higher for the advise-coitus arm. Other pregnancy and neonatal outcomes did not differ between the groups.

23169513,Preoperative delays in the US Medicare population with breast cancer.,J Clin Oncol,Bleicher RJ and Ruth K and Sigurdson ER and Ross E and Wong YN and Patel SA and Boraas M and Topham NS and Egleston BL,fccc,"PURPOSE: Although no specific delay threshold after diagnosis of breast cancer has been demonstrated to affect outcome, delays can cause anxiety, and surgical waiting time has been suggested as a quality measure. This study was performed to determine the interval from presentation to surgery in Medicare patients with nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and factors associated with a longer time to surgery. METHODS: Medicare claims linked to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data were reviewed for factors associated with delay between the first physician claim for a breast problem and first therapeutic surgery. RESULTS: Between 1992 and 2005, 72,586 Medicare patients with breast cancer had a median interval (delay) between first physician visit and surgery of 29 days, increasing from 21 days in 1992 to 32 days in 2005. Women (29 days v 24 days for men; P < .001), younger patients (29 days; P < .001), blacks and Hispanics (each 37 days; P < .001), patients in the northeast (33 days; P < .001), and patients in large metropolitan areas (32 days; P < .001) had longer delays. Patients having breast conservation and mastectomies had adjusted median delays of 28 and 30 days, respectively, with simultaneous reconstruction adding 12 days. Preoperative components, including imaging modalities, biopsy type, and clinician visits, were also each associated with a specific additional delay. CONCLUSION: Waiting times for breast cancer surgery have increased in Medicare patients, and measurable delays are associated with demographics and preoperative evaluation components. If such increases continue, periodic assessment may be required to rule out detrimental effects on outcomes.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/*surgery Female Humans Male Mastectomy Medicare/statistics & numerical data SEER Program Time Factors United States *Waiting Lists"

METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) -Medicare linked databases to analyze claims data for 202,299 patients dying as a result of lung, breast, prostate, colorectal, and pancreas cancers from 2000 to 2007. Logistic regression modeling was used to conduct adjusted analyses of potential impacts of demographic, health services, and treatment-related variables on receipt of RT and treatment with greater than 10 days of RT. Costs were calculated in 2009 dollars. RESULTS: Among the 15,287 patients (7.6%) who received RT in the last month of life, its use was associated with nonclinical factors such as race, gender, income, and hospice care. Of these patients, 2,721 (17.8%) received more than 10 days of treatment. Nonclinical factors that were associated with greater likelihood of receiving more than 10 days of RT in the last 30 days of life included: non-Hispanic white race, no receipt of hospice care, and treatment in a freestanding, versus a hospital-associated facility. Hospice care was associated with 32% decrease in total costs of care in the last month of life among those receiving RT. CONCLUSION: Although utilization of RT overall was low, almost one in five of patients who received RT in their final 30 days of life spent more than 10 of those days receiving treatment. More research is needed into physician decision making regarding use of RT for patients with end-stage cancer.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies Female Follow-Up Studies Health Care Costs Hospice Care/economics/*utilization Humans Male Medicare/economics/utilization Neoplasms/economics/epidemiology/mortality/*radiotherapy Prognosis Radiotherapy/economics/*utilization SEER Program Survival Rate United States/epidemiology"
23132702,Impact of oncology-related direct-to-consumer advertising: association with appropriate and inappropriate prescriptions.,Cancer,Abel GA and Chen K and Taback N and Hassett MJ and Schrag D and Weeks JC,harvard,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) on appropriate versus inappropriate prescribing. Aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy for breast cancer provides an ideal paradigm for studying this issue, because AIs have been the focus of substantial DTCA, and because they should only be used in postmenopausal women, age can serve as a simple surrogate marker of appropriateness. METHODS: Data regarding national DTCA spending for the AIs were obtained from TNS Multimedia; hormonal therapy prescription data were obtained from IMS Health. Time series analyses were performed to characterize the association between monthly changes in DTCA spending for the AIs and monthly changes in the proportion of all new hormonal therapy prescriptions represented by the AIs from October 2005 to September 2007. Analyses were stratified by age, considering prescriptions for women </= 40 (likely premenopausal) to be inappropriate and those for women > 60 (likely postmenopausal) to be appropriate. RESULTS: Monthly dollars spent on AI-associated DTCA varied considerably ($118,600 to $22,019,660). Time series analysis revealed that for every million dollars spent on DTCA for the AIs, there was an associated increase 3 months later in the new AI prescription proportion of 0.15% for all ages (P < .0001) and 0.18% for those > 60 years (P < .0001), but no significant change for those </= 40 at any time from 0 to 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: DTCA for the AIs was associated with increases in appropriate prescriptions with no significant effect on inappropriate prescriptions, suggesting that DTCA may not foster inappropriate medication use for certain drug classes.","Advertising as Topic/economics/*statistics & numerical data Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use Aromatase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use Consumer Participation *Drug Industry *Drug Prescriptions Drug Utilization/economics/*trends *Economics, Pharmaceutical Humans Inappropriate Prescribing"

Paradoxically, short-term metabolic studies have shown that caffeine impairs postprandial glycemic control. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to prospectively examine the association of caffeinated compared with caffeine-free beverages, including coffee, tea, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and carbonated artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs), with T2D risk. DESIGN: We prospectively observed 74,749 women from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, 1984-2008) and 39,059 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS, 1986-2008) who were free of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer at baseline. RESULTS: We documented 7370 incident cases of T2D during 24 y of follow-up in the NHS and 2865 new cases during 22 y of follow-up in the HPFS. After major lifestyle and dietary risk factors were controlled for, caffeinated and caffeine-free SSB intake was significantly associated with a higher risk of T2D in the NHS (RR per serving: 13% for caffeinated SSBs, 11% for caffeine-free SSBs; P < 0.05) and in the HPFS (RR per serving: 16% for caffeinated SSBs, 23% for caffeine-free SSBs; P < 0.01). Only caffeine-free ASB intake in NHS participants was associated with a higher risk of T2D (RR: 6% per serving; P < 0.001). Conversely, the consumption of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee was associated with a lower risk of T2D [RR per serving: 8% for both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee in the NHS (P < 0.0001) and 4% for caffeinated and 7% for decaffeinated coffee in the HPFS (P < 0.01)]. Only caffeinated tea was associated with a lower T2D risk among NHS participants (RR per serving: 5%; P < 0.0001).

23149531,Interventions to improve influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates among community-dwelling adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Ann Fam Med,Lau D and Hu J and Majumdar SR and Storie DA and Rees SE and Johnson JA,Missing,"PURPOSE: Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates remain below national targets. We systematically reviewed the effectiveness of quality improvement interventions for increasing the rates of influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations among community-dwelling adults. METHODS: We included randomized and nonrandomized studies with a concurrent control group. We estimated pooled odds ratios using random effects models, and used the Downs and Black tool to assess the quality of included studies. RESULTS: Most studies involved elderly primary care patients. Interventions were associated with improvements in the rates of any vaccination (111 comparisons in 77 studies, pooled odds ratio [OR] = 1.61, 95% CI, 1.49-1.75), and influenza (93 comparisons, 65 studies, OR = 1.46, 95% CI, 1.35-1.57) and pneumococcal (58 comparisons, 35 studies, OR = 2.01, 95% CI, 1.72-2.3) vaccinations. Interventions that appeared effective were patient financial incentives (influenza only), audit and feedback (influenza only), clinician reminders, clinician financial incentives (influenza only), team change, patient outreach, delivery site changes (influenza only), clinician education (pneumococcus only), and case management (pneumococcus only). Patient outreach was more effective if personal contact was involved. Team changes were more effective where nurses administered influenza vaccinations independently. Heterogeneity in some pooled odds ratios was high, however, and funnel plots showed signs of potential publication bias. Study quality varied but was not associated with outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Quality improvement interventions, especially those that assign vaccination responsibilities to nonphysician personnel or that activate patients through personal contact, can modestly improve vaccination rates in community-dwelling adults. To meet national policy targets, more-potent interventions should be developed and evaluated.",Adult Humans *Immunization Programs Influenza Vaccines/*administration & dosage Pneumococcal Vaccines/*administration & dosage Primary Health Care Quality Improvement/*statistics & numerical data Quality of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data

OBJECTIVE: The study was undertaken to determine whether supplementing pregnant women with phosphatidylcholine (the main dietary source of choline) improves the cognitive abilities of their offspring. DESIGN: In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 140 pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive supplemental phosphatidylcholine (750 mg) or a placebo (corn oil) from 18 wk gestation through 90 d postpartum. Their infants (n = 99) were tested for short-term visuospatial memory, long-term episodic memory, language development, and global development at 10 and 12 mo of age. RESULTS: The women studied ate diets that delivered approximately 360 mg choline/d in foods ( approximately 80% of the recommended intake for pregnant women, 65% of the recommended intake for lactating women). The phosphatidylcholine supplements were well tolerated. Groups did not differ significantly in global development, language development, short-term visuospatial memory, or long-term episodic memory. CONCLUSIONS: Phosphatidylcholine supplementation of pregnant women eating diets containing moderate amounts of choline did not enhance their infants' brain function. It is possible that a longer follow-up period would reveal late-emerging effects. Moreover, future studies should determine whether supplementing mothers eating diets much lower in choline content, such as those consumed in several low-income countries, would enhance infant brain development.","*Child Development Choline Deficiency/*diet therapy/etiology/physiopathology *Cognition Diet/adverse effects *Dietary Supplements/adverse effects Double-Blind Method Female Humans Infant, Newborn *Lactation Language Development Male *Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena Memory, Long-Term Memory, Short-Term North Carolina Phosphatidylcholines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications/diet therapy/etiology/physiopathology Severity of Illness Index"

The effect of certificate of need programs on the use of intensity modulated radiation therapy and the increasing costs of prostate cancer care is unknown. We compared the use of intensity modulated radiation therapy and change in prostate cancer health care costs in regions with vs without active certificate of need programs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This population based, observational study using SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results)-Medicare linked data from 2002 through 2009 was comprised of 13,814 men treated for prostate cancer in 3 regions with active certificate of need programs (CON Yes) vs 44,541 men treated for prostate cancer in 9 regions without active certificate of need programs (CON No). We assessed intensity modulated radiation therapy use relative to other prostate cancer definitive therapies and overall prostate cancer health care costs with respect to certificate of need status. RESULTS: In propensity score adjusted analyses, intensity modulated radiation therapy use increased from 2.3% to 46.4% of prostate cancer definitive therapies in CON Yes regions vs 11.3% to 41.7% in CON No regions from 2002 to 2009. Furthermore, we observed greater intensity modulated radiation therapy use with time in CON Yes vs No regions (p <0.001). Annual cost growth did not differ between CON Yes vs No regions (p = 0.396). CONCLUSIONS: Certificate of need programs were not effective in limiting intensity modulated radiation therapy use or attenuating prostate cancer health care costs. There remains an unmet need to control the rapid adoption of new, more expensive therapies for prostate cancer that have limited cost and comparative effectiveness data.","Aged *Certificate of Need *Health Care Costs Humans Male Prostatic Neoplasms/*economics/*radiotherapy Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated/*economics/*utilization"
23184108,Emergency contraception.,Pediatrics,Missing,Missing,"Despite significant declines over the past 2 decades, the United States continues to have teen birth rates that are significantly higher than other industrialized nations. Use of emergency contraception can reduce the risk of pregnancy if used up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure and is most effective if used in the first 24 hours. Indications for the use of emergency contraception include sexual assault, unprotected intercourse, condom breakage or slippage, and missed or late doses of hormonal contraceptives, including the oral contraceptive pill, contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring (ie, improper placement or loss/expulsion), and injectable contraception. Adolescents younger than 17 years must obtain a prescription from a physician to access emergency contraception in most states. In all states, both males and females 17 years or older can obtain emergency contraception without a prescription. Adolescents are more likely to use emergency contraception if it has been prescribed in advance of need. The aim of this updated policy statement is to (1) educate pediatricians and other physicians on available emergency contraceptive methods; (2) provide current data on safety, efficacy, and use of emergency contraception in teenagers; and (3) encourage routine counseling and advance emergency-contraception prescription as 1 part of a public health strategy to reduce teen pregnancy. This policy focuses on pharmacologic methods of emergency contraception used within 120 hours of unprotected or underprotected coitus for the prevention of unintended pregnancy. Emergency contraceptive medications include products labeled and dedicated for use as emergency contraception by the US Food and Drug Administration (levonorgestrel and ulipristal) and the ""off-label"" use of combination oral contraceptives.","Adolescent Coitus Contraception, Postcoital/adverse effects/*methods/utilization Cross-Sectional Studies Female Health Services Accessibility/legislation & jurisprudence Humans Male Pregnancy Pregnancy in Adolescence/*prevention & control/statistics & numerical data Pregnancy, Unplanned Treatment Outcome United States United States Food and Drug Administration Utilization Review/statistics & numerical data Young Adult"

On a mixed genetic background, the lethality was attenuated, with some mice surviving beyond weaning and then succumbing to an aggressive multiorgan inflammatory response. We found that in dendritic cells (DCs), ARIH2 caused degradation of the inhibitor IkappaBbeta in the nucleus, which abrogated its ability to sequester, protect and transcriptionally coactivate the transcription factor subunit p65 in the nucleus. Loss of ARIH2 caused dysregulated activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in DCs, which led to lethal activation of the immune system in ARIH2-sufficent mice reconstituted with ARIH2-deficient hematopoietic stem cells.

Influenza vaccines based on mRNA may offer a solution as sequence-matched, clinical-grade material could be produced reliably and rapidly in a scalable process, allowing quick response to the emergence of pandemic strains. Here we show that mRNA vaccines induce balanced, long-lived and protective immunity to influenza A virus infections in even very young and very old mice and that the vaccine remains protective upon thermal stress. This vaccine format elicits B and T cell-dependent protection and targets multiple antigens, including the highly conserved viral nucleoprotein, indicating its usefulness as a cross-protective vaccine. In ferrets and pigs, mRNA vaccines induce immunological correlates of protection and protective effects similar to those of a licensed influenza vaccine in pigs. Thus, mRNA vaccines could address substantial medical need in the area of influenza prophylaxis and the broader realm of anti-infective vaccinology.","Aging/immunology Animals Animals, Newborn B-Lymphocytes/immunology Biotechnology Cross Protection Female Ferrets Humans Influenza A virus/*genetics/*immunology Influenza Vaccines/*genetics/*immunology Mice Mice, Inbred BALB C Mice, Inbred C57BL Mice, Inbred DBA Molecular Sequence Data Orthomyxoviridae Infections/immunology/prevention & control RNA, Messenger/*genetics/*immunology RNA, Viral/genetics/immunology Rats Rats, Inbred Lew Sus scrofa T-Lymphocytes/immunology Vaccines, Synthetic/genetics/immunology"

METHODS: The study population included 441,211 participants (133,018 men and 308,193 women) from the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition. We investigated 14,563 participants who developed a TRC during an average follow-up of 11 years. The impact of smoking cigarettes on cancer risk was assessed by the population attributable fraction (AF(p)), calculated using the adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CI for current and former smokers, plus either the prevalence of smoking among cancer cases or estimates from surveys in representative samples of the population in each country. RESULTS: The proportion of all TRC attributable to cigarette smoking was 34.9% (95% CI, 32.5 to 37.4) using the smoking prevalence among cases and 36.2% (95% CI, 33.7 to 38.6) using the smoking prevalence from the population. The AF(p) were above 80% for cancers of the lung and larynx, between 20% and 50% for most respiratory and digestive cancers and tumors from the lower urinary tract, and below 20% for the remaining TRC. CONCLUSION: Using data on cancer incidence for 2008 and our AF(p) estimates, about 270,000 new cancer diagnoses per year can be considered attributable to cigarette smoking in the eight European countries with available data for both men and women (Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Greece, Germany, Sweden, Denmark).",Adolescent Adult Europe/epidemiology Female Humans Male Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Smoking/*epidemiology Young Adult
23184969,Forecasting seasonal outbreaks of influenza.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Shaman J and Karspeck A,columbia,"Influenza recurs seasonally in temperate regions of the world; however, our ability to predict the timing, duration, and magnitude of local seasonal outbreaks of influenza remains limited. Here we develop a framework for initializing real-time forecasts of seasonal influenza outbreaks, using a data assimilation technique commonly applied in numerical weather prediction. The availability of real-time, web-based estimates of local influenza infection rates makes this type of quantitative forecasting possible. Retrospective ensemble forecasts are generated on a weekly basis following assimilation of these web-based estimates for the 2003-2008 influenza seasons in New York City. The findings indicate that real-time skillful predictions of peak timing can be made more than 7 wk in advance of the actual peak. In addition, confidence in those predictions can be inferred from the spread of the forecast ensemble. This work represents an initial step in the development of a statistically rigorous system for real-time forecast of seasonal influenza.","Computational Biology Computer Simulation *Disease Outbreaks/statistics & numerical data Forecasting/*methods Humans Humidity Influenza, Human/*epidemiology Models, Statistical New York City/epidemiology Retrospective Studies *Seasons"
23229908,Breast cancer treatment decision-making: are we asking too much of patients?,J Gen Intern Med,Livaudais JC and Franco R and Fei K and Bickell NA,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: Physicians are mandated to offer treatment choices to patients, yet not all patients may want the responsibility that entails. We evaluated predisposing factors for, and long-term consequences of, too much and not enough perceived decision-making responsibility among breast cancer patients. DESIGN: Longitudinal assessment, with measurements collected just after surgical treatment (baseline) and 6-month follow-up. PARTICIPANTS: Women with early-stage breast cancer treated surgically at eight NYC hospitals, recruited for a randomized controlled trial of patient assistance to improve receipt of adjuvant treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Using logistic regression, we explored multivariable-adjusted associations between perceived treatment decision-making responsibility and a) baseline knowledge of treatment benefit and b) 6-month decision regret. RESULTS: Of 368 women aged 28-89 years, 72 % reported a ""reasonable amount"", 21 % ""too much"", and 7 % ""not enough"" responsibility for treatment decision-making at baseline. Health literacy problems were most common among those with ""not enough"" (68 %) and ""too much"" responsibility (62 %). Only 29 % of women had knowledge of treatment benefits; 40 % experienced 6-month decision regret. In multivariable analysis, women reporting ""too much"" vs. ""reasonable amount"" of responsibility had less treatment knowledge ([OR] = 0.44, [95 % CI] = 0.20-0.99; model c = 0.7343;p < 0.01) and more decision regret ([OR] = 2.,91 [95 % CI] = 1.40-6.06; model c = 0.7937;p < 0.001). Findings were similar for women reporting ""not enough"" responsibility, though not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Too much perceived responsibility for breast cancer treatment decisions was associated with poor baseline treatment knowledge and 6-month decision regret. Health literacy problems were common, suggesting that health care professionals find alternative ways to communicate with low health literacy patients, enabling them to assume the desired amount of decision-making responsibility, thereby reducing decision regret.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Breast Neoplasms/psychology/*therapy Chemotherapy, Adjuvant Choice Behavior *Decision Making Female *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Humans Longitudinal Studies Middle Aged New York Patient Participation/psychology *Physician-Patient Relations Self Efficacy Socioeconomic Factors"
23197572,Tadalafil alleviates muscle ischemia in patients with Becker muscular dystrophy.,Sci Transl Med,Martin EA and Barresi R and Byrne BJ and Tsimerinov EI and Scott BL and Walker AE and Gurudevan SV and Anene F and Elashoff RM and Thomas GD and Victor RG,Missing,"Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a progressive X-linked muscle wasting disease for which there is no treatment. Like Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), BMD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin, a structural cytoskeletal protein that also targets other proteins to the muscle sarcolemma. Among these is neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSmu), which requires certain spectrin-like repeats in dystrophin's rod domain and the adaptor protein alpha-syntrophin to be targeted to the sarcolemma. When healthy skeletal muscle is subjected to exercise, sarcolemmal nNOSmu-derived NO attenuates local alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction, thereby optimizing perfusion of muscle. We found previously that this protective mechanism is defective-causing functional muscle ischemia-in dystrophin-deficient muscles of the mdx mouse (a model of DMD) and of children with DMD, in whom nNOSmu is mislocalized to the cytosol instead of the sarcolemma. We report that this protective mechanism also is defective in men with BMD in whom the most common dystrophin mutations disrupt sarcolemmal targeting of nNOSmu. In these men, the vasoconstrictor response, measured as a decrease in muscle oxygenation, to reflex sympathetic activation is not appropriately attenuated during exercise of the dystrophic muscles. In a randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial, we show that functional muscle ischemia is alleviated and normal blood flow regulation is fully restored in the muscles of men with BMD by boosting NO-cGMP (guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate) signaling with a single dose of the drug tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase 5A inhibitor. These results further support an essential role for sarcolemmal nNOSmu in the normal modulation of sympathetic vasoconstriction in exercising human skeletal muscle and implicate the NO-cGMP pathway as a putative new target for treating BMD.","Adolescent Adult Animals Biopsy Carbolines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use Child Child, Preschool Humans Immunohistochemistry Ischemia/*complications/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology Male Mice Middle Aged Muscle, Skeletal/*blood supply/drug effects/pathology/physiopathology Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne/*complications/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use Sympatholytics/pharmacology Young Adult"
23164394,Occupational exposure to herbs containing aristolochic acids increases the risk of urothelial carcinoma in Chinese herbalists.,J Urol,Yang HY and Wang JD and Lo TC and Chen PC,Missing,"PURPOSE: Aristolochic acid can cause urothelial carcinoma. Herbal remedies containing aristolochic acids were previously categorized as proven group 1 human carcinogens by the WHO cancer agency, the International Agency for Research on Cancer. However, the health effect on workers exposed to aristolochic acid is unclear. Fangchi, a representative herb containing aristolochic acid, is commonly used in the Chinese herbal medicine industry. We determined whether workers exposed to fangchi are at increased risk for urothelial carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a case-control study based in a national representative cohort of Chinese herbalists. This study analyzed 6,564 Chinese herbalists employed between 1985 and 1998. All incident cases of urothelial carcinoma that occurred between 1988 and 2001 were defined as the case group. Controls were selected from the baseline cohort in a randomized manner. A total of 24 cases and 140 controls were included in analysis. Information about fangchi exposure was obtained in a questionnaire survey administered in 2002. RESULTS: Processing, selling or dispensing herbs containing fangchi significantly increased the risk of urothelial carcinoma (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.3, p = 0.03). This relationship was independent of cigarette smoking or potential arsenic exposure from drinking water from deep wells. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to the Chinese herbal drug fangchi increases the risk of urothelial carcinoma in herbalists. Appropriate medical monitoring is warranted for workers who have similar exposure.","Adult Aristolochic Acids/*adverse effects Asian Continental Ancestry Group Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/*chemically induced/epidemiology Case-Control Studies Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*adverse effects Female *Herbal Medicine Humans Male Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects Risk Factors Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology"

The purpose of this study was to use the Healthy Eating Index-2005, a measure of diet quality in terms of conformance to the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, to describe the diet quality of Americans by varying sociodemographic characteristics in order to provide insight as to where diets need to improve. The Healthy Eating Index-2005 scores were estimated using 1 day of dietary intake data provided by participants in the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Mean daily intakes of foods and nutrients, expressed per 1,000 kilocalories, were estimated using the population ratio method and compared with standards that reflect the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Participants included 3,286 children (2 to 17 years), 3,690 young and middle-aged adults (18 to 64 years), and 1,296 older adults (65+ years). Results are reported as percentages of maximum scores and tested for significant differences (P </= 0.05) by age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, and education levels. Children and older adults had better-quality diets than younger and middle-aged adults; women had better-quality diets than men; Hispanics had better-quality diets than blacks and whites; and diet quality of adults, but not children, generally improved with income level, except for sodium. The diets of Americans, regardless of socioeconomic status, are far from optimal. Problematic dietary patterns were found among all sociodemographic groups. Major improvements in the nutritional health of the American public can be made by improving eating patterns.","Adolescent Adult Age Distribution Aged Child Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies *Diet/economics/ethnology/standards *Educational Status Ethnic Groups/*statistics & numerical data Female Health Status Indicators Humans Male Middle Aged *Nutrition Policy Nutrition Surveys Sex Distribution Socioeconomic Factors United States Young Adult"

Substance abuse is a prevalent risk factor for stroke in young adults. We sought to identify trends in substance abuse detection among stroke patients. METHODS: Using a population-based design, we sought to identify all patients aged 18 to 54 years experiencing a stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) in the Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky Study region during 1993 to 1994, 1999, and 2005. Demographic and clinical characteristics and substance use data were obtained retrospectively from chart review and adjudicated by physicians. RESULTS: The number of young patients identified with a stroke increased from 1993 to 1994 (297) to 2005 (501). Blacks (61% vs 51%; P<0.02) and men (61% vs 47%; P<0.002) reported substance abuse (current smoking, alcohol, or illegal drug use) more frequently than did whites and women. Overall use of substances increased across study periods, 45% in 1993 versus 62% in 2005 (P=0.003). The trend was significant for illegal drug use (3.8% in 1993 vs 19.8% in 2005) and ever smoking (49% in 1993 vs 66% in 2005). Documentation of both cocaine and marijuana use increased over time. In 2005, half of young adults with a stroke were current smokers, and 1 in 5 abused illegal drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Substance abuse is common in young adults experiencing a stroke. The observed increase in substance abuse is contributing to the increased incidence of stroke in young adults. Patients aged younger than 55 years who experience a stroke should be routinely screened and counseled regarding substance abuse.",Adolescent Adult Age Distribution Brain Ischemia/*epidemiology Cerebral Hemorrhage/*epidemiology Female Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Prevalence Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Sex Distribution Smoking/epidemiology Stroke/*epidemiology Substance-Related Disorders/*epidemiology Young Adult

However, the findings are heterogeneous. METHODS: We systematically reviewed studies on HPV infection and laryngeal cancer published up to 15 May 2012 and quantitatively summarized the prevalence of HPV infection and its association with the risk of laryngeal cancer by means of meta-analysis. RESULTS: In total, 55 eligible studies were included. The overall HPV prevalence in laryngeal cancer tissues was 28.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.5%-32.9%). A total of 26.6% laryngeal cancer patients were infected with high-risk HPV types only, and HPV-16 was most frequently observed type, with a prevalence of 19.8% (95% CI, 15.7%-24.6%). The meta-analysis based on 12 eligible case-control studies suggests a strong association between HPV infection and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, with a summary odds ratio (OR) of 5.39 (95% CI, 3.25-8.94).

METHODS: This 21-week, randomized, crossover study assessed appetitive ratings following the inclusion of fruits and vegetables, in solid and beverage form, into the habitual diet of healthy lean (n=15) and overweight/obese (n=19) adults with low customary consumption. The primary acute outcomes were satiation (amount of challenge meal consumed), satiety (latency of subsequent eating event) and dietary compensation after a 400 kcal fruit preload. Ratings of appetite were also obtained before and after 8 weeks of required increased fruit and vegetable consumption (20% estimated energy requirement). RESULTS: Acutely, overweight/obese participants reported smaller reductions of hunger after consuming the fruit preload in beverage compared with solid form (preload x form x body mass index effects, P=0.03). Participants also consumed significantly less of a challenge meal (in both gram and energy) after the ingestion of the solid fruit preload (P<0.005). However, the subsequent meal latency was not significantly different between the solid and the beverage fruit preloads. Total daily energy intake was significantly higher when the obese participants consumed the beverage fruit preload compared with the solid (P<0.001). Daily energy intake was markedly, but not significantly, higher among the lean with the beverage vs solid food form. Hunger and fullness ratings remained stable when participants consumed fruits and vegetables in solid or beverage form for 8 weeks each.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare the prevalence of hearing impairment between diabetic and nondiabetic adults. DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic literature search using MEDLINE (1950 to May 30, 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to May 30, 2011). STUDY SELECTION: Cross-sectional studies were included if data on numbers of hearing-impaired and non-hearing-impaired cases with diabetes were presented. Hearing impairment was limited to that assessed by pure-tone audiometry that included at least 2 kHz of frequency range and was defined as progressive, chronic, sensorineural, or without specified cause. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently extracted relevant data. Odd ratios (ORs) of hearing impairment related to diabetes calculated in each study were pooled with the random-effects model. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data were obtained from 13 eligible studies (20,194 participants and 7,377 cases). Overall pooled OR (95% confidence interval) of hearing impairment for diabetic participants compared with nondiabetic participants was 2.15 (1.72-2.68). OR was higher in younger participants (mean age, </=60 yr) than in those over 60 yr among which the OR remained significant (2.61 and 1.58, P = 0.008). The strength of the association between diabetes and prevalence of hearing impairment was not significantly influenced by whether participants were matched for age and gender (P = 0.68) or whether participants chronically exposed to noisy environments were excluded (P = 0.19).

However, whether there is an additional risk among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is unknown. METHODS: We developed a population-based cohort from the IMS LifeLink Health Plan Claims Database, which includes managed care organizations in the United States. Women aged 18-46 years taking combined oral contraceptives and who had a claim for PCOS (n = 43 506) were matched, based on a propensity score, to control women (n = 43 506) taking oral contraceptives. Venous thromboembolism was defined using administrative coding and use of anticoagulation. We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess the relative risk (RR) of venous thromboembolism among users of combined oral contraceptives with and without PCOS. RESULTS: The incidence of venous thromboembolism among women with PCOS was 23.7/10 000 person-years, while that for matched controls was 10.9/10 000 person-years. Women with PCOS taking combined oral contraceptives had an RR for venous thromboembolism of 2.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-3.24) compared with other contraceptive users. The incidence of venous thromboembolism was 6.3/10 000 person-years among women with PCOS not taking oral contraceptives; the incidence was 4.1/10 000 person-years among matched controls. The RR of venous thromboembolism among women with PCOS not taking oral contraceptives was 1.55 (95% CI 1.10-2.19). INTERPRETATION: We found a 2-fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism among women with PCOS who were taking combined oral contraceptives and a 1.5-fold increased risk among women with PCOS not taking oral contraceptives. Physicians should consider the increased risk of venous thromboembolism when prescribing contraceptive therapy to women with PCOS.","Adolescent Adult Case-Control Studies Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*adverse effects Female Humans Incidence Middle Aged Poisson Distribution Polycystic Ovary Syndrome/*complications Propensity Score Proportional Hazards Models Risk Factors United States/epidemiology Venous Thromboembolism/epidemiology/*etiology"

We analysed post-mortem brains obtained from a cohort of 85 subjects with histories of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury and found evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in 68 subjects: all males, ranging in age from 17 to 98 years (mean 59.5 years), including 64 athletes, 21 military veterans (86% of whom were also athletes) and one individual who engaged in self-injurious head banging behaviour. Eighteen age- and gender-matched individuals without a history of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury served as control subjects. In chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the spectrum of hyperphosphorylated tau pathology ranged in severity from focal perivascular epicentres of neurofibrillary tangles in the frontal neocortex to severe tauopathy affecting widespread brain regions, including the medial temporal lobe, thereby allowing a progressive staging of pathology from stages I-IV. Multifocal axonal varicosities and axonal loss were found in deep cortex and subcortical white matter at all stages of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 immunoreactive inclusions and neurites were also found in 85% of cases, ranging from focal pathology in stages I-III to widespread inclusions and neurites in stage IV. Symptoms in stage I chronic traumatic encephalopathy included headache and loss of attention and concentration. Additional symptoms in stage II included depression, explosivity and short-term memory loss. In stage III, executive dysfunction and cognitive impairment were found, and in stage IV, dementia, word-finding difficulty and aggression were characteristic. Data on athletic exposure were available for 34 American football players; the stage of chronic traumatic encephalopathy correlated with increased duration of football play, survival after football and age at death. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy was the sole diagnosis in 43 cases (63%); eight were also diagnosed with motor neuron disease (12%), seven with Alzheimer's disease (11%), 11 with Lewy body disease (16%) and four with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (6%). There is an ordered and predictable progression of hyperphosphorylated tau abnormalities through the nervous system in chronic traumatic encephalopathy that occurs in conjunction with widespread axonal disruption and loss. The frequent association of chronic traumatic encephalopathy with other neurodegenerative disorders suggests that repetitive brain trauma and hyperphosphorylated tau protein deposition promote the accumulation of other abnormally aggregated proteins including TAR DNA-binding protein 43, amyloid beta protein and alpha-synuclein.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Athletes Brain/metabolism/*pathology Brain Injury, Chronic/metabolism/*pathology Disease Progression Football Humans Male Middle Aged Neurofibrillary Tangles/metabolism/pathology Tauopathies/metabolism/*pathology Veterans tau Proteins/metabolism"

Two studies, one behavioral and one using neuroimaging methodology, identified age differences in trust and their neural underpinnings. Older and younger adults rated faces high in trust cues similarly, but older adults perceived faces with cues to untrustworthiness to be significantly more trustworthy and approachable than younger adults. This age-related pattern was mirrored in neural activation to cues of trustworthiness. Whereas younger adults showed greater anterior insula activation to untrustworthy versus trustworthy faces, older adults showed muted activation of the anterior insula to untrustworthy faces. The insula has been shown to support interoceptive awareness that forms the basis of ""gut feelings,"" which represent expected risk and predict risk-avoidant behavior. Thus, a diminished ""gut"" response to cues of untrustworthiness may partially underlie older adults' vulnerability to fraud.","Adult *Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Amygdala/physiology Behavior Brain Mapping/methods Emotions Humans Limbic System/*physiology Middle Aged Neuroimaging/methods *Perception Risk *Trust Young Adult"

Individual measures included engagement in frequent physical fighting, age, gender, participation in multiple risk behaviors, victimization by bullying, and family affluence. Contextual measures included national income inequality, absolute wealth and homicide rates. Temporal measure was survey cycle (year). RESULTS: Frequent physical fighting declined over time in 19 (63%) of 30 countries (from descriptive then multiple Poisson regression analyses). Contextual measures of absolute wealth (relative risk 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.93-0.99 per 1 SD increase in gross domestic product per capita) but not income inequality (relative risk 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.98-1.05 per 1 SD increase) related to lower levels of engagement in fighting. Other risk factors identified were male gender, younger age (11 years), multiple risk behaviors, victimization by bullying, and national homicide rates. CONCLUSIONS: Between 2002 and 2010, adolescent physical fighting declined in most countries. Specific groups of adolescents require targeted violence reduction programs. Possible determinants responsible for the observed declines are discussed.",Adolescent Adolescent Behavior/*psychology Child Crime Victims/*economics/psychology Cross-Sectional Studies Europe/epidemiology Female Humans Male North America/epidemiology Socioeconomic Factors Students/*psychology Violence/*economics/psychology/*trends
23213088,Effect of patient socioeconomic status on access to early-phase cancer trials.,J Clin Oncol,Mohd Noor A and Sarker D and Vizor S and McLennan B and Hunter S and Suder A and Moller H and Spicer JF and Papa S,Missing,"PURPOSE: Little is known about the influence of socioeconomic factors on patient access to cancer trials. Differences should be considered to ensure generalizability of trial results and equality of access. METHODS: Phase I trials unit referrals at our center over 5 years, from 2007 to 2012, were reviewed. Socioeconomic status was defined by the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD; 1, least deprived; 5, most deprived). Multivariate analysis was performed comparing incident cancer cases with referred patients and those ultimately enrolled onto a trial. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty patients were referred (median age, 62 years). Compared with 10,784 incident cases, referral was less likely for patients in the more-deprived quintiles compared with the least deprived (IMD 5: odds ratio [OR], 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.74). Once reviewed in the unit, enrollment onto a trial was not affected (IMD 5: OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.63). Ethnicity analysis showed the nonwhite population was less likely to be recruited (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.88). This relationship was lost with adjustment for age, sex, cancer type, and deprivation index. CONCLUSION: We show for the first time to our knowledge that socioeconomic status affects early-phase cancer trial referrals. The least-deprived patients are almost twice as likely to be referred compared with the most deprived. This may be because more-deprived patients are less suitable for a trial-as a result of comorbidities, for example-or because of inequalities that could be addressed by patient or referrer education. Once reviewed at the unit, enrollment onto a trial is not affected by deprivation.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Clinical Trials as Topic/*economics/statistics & numerical data Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic/*economics Female Great Britain/epidemiology Health Services Accessibility/*economics Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplasms/*economics/epidemiology/psychology Social Class Young Adult"
23212881,Short term outcomes after extreme preterm birth in England: comparison of two birth cohorts in 1995 and 2006 (the EPICure studies).,BMJ,Costeloe KL and Hennessy EM and Haider S and Stacey F and Marlow N and Draper ES,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To determine survival and neonatal morbidity for babies born between 22 and 26 weeks' gestation in England during 2006, and to evaluate changes in outcome since 1995 for babies born between 22 and 25 weeks' gestation. DESIGN: Prospective national cohort studies. SETTING: Maternity and neonatal units in England. PARTICIPANTS: 3133 births between 22 and 26 weeks' gestation in 2006; 666 admissions to neonatal units in 1995 and 1115 in 2006 of babies born between 22 and 25 weeks' gestation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival to discharge from hospital, pregnancy and delivery outcomes, infant morbidity until discharge. RESULTS: In 2006, survival of live born babies was 2% (n=3) for those born at 22 weeks' gestation, 19% (n=66) at 23 weeks, 40% (n=178) at 24 weeks, 66% (n=346) at 25 weeks, and 77% (n=448) at 26 weeks (P<0.001). At discharge from hospital, 68% (n=705) of survivors had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (receiving supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age), 13% (n=135) had evidence of serious abnormality on cerebral ultrasonography, and 16% (n=166) had laser treatment for retinopathy of prematurity. For babies born between 22 and 25 weeks' gestation from March to December, the number of admissions for neonatal care increased by 44%, from 666 in 1995 to 959 in 2006. By 2006 adherence to evidence based practice associated with improved outcome had significantly increased. Survival increased from 40% to 53% (P<0.001) overall and at each week of gestation: by 9.5% (confidence interval -0.1% to 19%) at 23 weeks, 12% (4% to 20%) at 24 weeks, and 16% (9% to 23%) at 25 weeks. The proportions of babies surviving in 2006 with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, major cerebral scan abnormality, or weight and/or head circumference <-2 SD were similar to those in 1995, but the proportion treated for retinopathy of prematurity had increased from 13% to 22% (P=0.006). Predictors of mortality and morbidity were similar in both cohorts. CONCLUSION: Survival of babies born between 22 and 25 weeks' gestation has increased since 1995 but the pattern of major neonatal morbidity and the proportion of survivors affected are unchanged. These observations reflect an important increase in the number of preterm survivors at risk of later health problems.","Cohort Studies England/epidemiology Female Gestational Age Guideline Adherence Humans Infant Mortality/*trends *Infant, Extremely Premature Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature, Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology/therapy Intensive Care, Neonatal/methods/statistics & numerical data/*trends Kaplan-Meier Estimate Linear Models Logistic Models Male Obstetric Labor Complications/epidemiology Outcome Assessment (Health Care) Patient Discharge Practice Guidelines as Topic Pregnancy Pregnancy Outcome Prospective Studies Risk Factors"

OBJECTIVES: To investigate menstrual cycle variation in respiratory symptoms in a large general population, using chronobiology methodology, and stratifying by body mass index (BMI), smoking, and asthma status. METHODS: A total of 3,926 women with regular cycles less than or equal to 28 days and not taking exogenous sex hormones answered a postal questionnaire regarding the first day of their last menstruation and respiratory symptoms in the last 3 days. Moving 4-day means were computed to smooth uneven records of daily sampling; best-fitting 28-day composite cosine curves were applied to each time series to describe rhythmicity. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Significant rhythmic variations over the menstrual cycle were found in each symptom for all subjects and subgroups. Wheezing was higher on cycle Days 10-22, with a midcycle dip near the time of putative ovulation (approximately Days 14-16) in most subgroups. Shortness of breath was higher on days 7-21, with a dip just before midcycle in many subgroups. Cough was higher just after putative ovulation for subjects with asthma, BMI greater than or equal to 23 kg/m(2), and smokers, or just before ovulation and menses onset for low symptomatic subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory symptoms varied significantly during the menstrual cycle and were most frequent from the midluteal to midfollicular stages, often with a dip near the time of ovulation. The patterns varied by BMI, smoking, and asthma status. These relations link respiratory symptoms with hormonal changes through the menstrual cycle and imply a potential for individualized chronotherapy for respiratory diseases.",Adult Asthma/epidemiology Baltic States/epidemiology Body Mass Index Comorbidity Europe/epidemiology Female Humans Menstrual Cycle/*physiology Middle Aged Questionnaires Respiration Disorders/*epidemiology *Respiratory Physiological Phenomena Smoking/epidemiology

Preclinical studies demonstrate that plaque prevention is possible; however, the more relevant therapeutic removal of existing plaque has proven elusive. Monoclonal antibodies in development target both soluble and insoluble Abeta peptide. We hypothesized that antibody specificity for deposited plaque was critical for plaque removal since soluble Abeta peptide would block recognition of deposited forms. We developed a plaque-specific antibody that targets a modified Abeta peptide (Abeta(p3-42)), which showed robust clearance of pre-existing plaque without causing microhemorrhage. Interestingly, a comparator N-terminal Abeta antibody 3D6, which binds both soluble and insoluble Abeta(1-42), lacked efficacy for lowering existing plaque but manifested a significant microhemorrhage liability. Mechanistic studies suggested that the lack of efficacy for 3D6 was attributed to poor target engagement in plaques. These studies have profound implications for the development of therapeutic Abeta antibodies for Alzheimer's disease.","Age Factors Alzheimer Disease/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology Amyloid beta-Peptides/immunology/metabolism Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/genetics Animals Disease Models, Animal Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Hemorrhage/chemically induced Hippocampus/metabolism/pathology Humans Immunoglobulin G/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Immunotherapy/*methods Mice Mice, Transgenic Peptide Fragments/immunology/metabolism Plaque, Amyloid/*immunology/pathology"

All of the 19 subjects who received MDMA-assisted treatment in the original trial participated in the long-term follow-up (LTFU), with 16 out of 19 completing all of the long-term outcome measures, which were administered from 17 to 74 months after the original study's final MDMA session (mean = 45.4; SD = 17.3). Our primary outcome measure used was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Secondary outcome measures were the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Neuroticism Extroversion Oppenness Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R) Personality Inventory. We also collected a long-term follow-up questionnaire.

DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Forty Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical centers across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Four thousand one hundred forty-three women aged 65 and older without probable dementia at baseline who participated in the WHI Calcium and Vitamin D Trial and the WHI Memory Study. INTERVENTION: Two thousand thirty-four women were randomized to receive 1,000 mg of calcium carbonate combined with 400 IU of vitamin D(3) (treatment) and 2,109 to placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Primary: classifications of probable dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) based on a four-phase protocol that included central adjudication. Secondary: global cognitive function and individual cognitive subtests. RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 71. During a mean follow-up of 7.8 years, 39 participants in the treatment group and 37 in the placebo group developed incident dementia (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.71-1.74, P = .64).

OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether plasma phospholipid omega-6 concentrations are associated with risk of HF in US male physicians. In a secondary analysis, we evaluated whether such an association differs between HF with and without previous myocardial infarction (MI). DESIGN: With the use of a nested case-control design, this ancillary study comprised 788 cases and 788 matched controls from the Physicians' Health Study. Plasma omega-6 PUFAs were measured by using gas chromatography. RESULTS: The mean age of subjects was 58.7 y with a mean follow-up time of 17.1 y.

We quantified the differential mortality rates of nonsex specific cancers between the sexes and compared cancer stage distributions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this descriptive epidemiological study we obtained the incidence of new cancer cases, cancer deaths and stage distributions for the last 10 years in the United States from SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) program results. Sex specific cancers were excluded from study. We compared male-to-female relative mortality rate for all cancers as well as the average male-to-female relative mortality rate weighted by cancer incidence in the last 10 years. Sex specific stage distributions were also compared with the Kendall tau-c test. RESULTS: The male-to-female relative mortality rate for any cancer was 1.060 (95% CI 1.055-1.065). The average male-to-female relative mortality rate for the same cancer was 1.126 (95% CI 1.086-1.168). The discrepancy in incidence and mortality rates was stable for the last 10 years. Of the top 10 most common cancers men had an unfavorable stage distribution in all except colorectal, bladder and brain cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Men are more likely to have nonsex specific cancer than women and more likely to die of the cancer even after controlling for the incidence.

DESIGN: Randomised, controlled, single-blinded trial using a three-arm design. SETTING: Aarhus University Hospital Skejby in Denmark during the period July 2009 until August 2011. POPULATION: A total of 1222 healthy nulliparous women. METHOD: Use of epidural analgesia and self-reported pain during delivery was compared in three groups: a hypnosis group receiving three 1-hour lessons in self-hypnosis with additional audiorecordings to ease childbirth, a relaxation group receiving three 1-hour lessons in various relaxation methods and mindfulness with audiorecordings for additional training, and a usual care group receiving ordinary antenatal care only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY OUTCOME: Use of epidural analgesia. Secondary outcomes included self-reported pain. RESULTS: There were no between-group differences in use of epidural analgesia-31.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 27.1-35.3) in the hypnosis group, 29.8% (95% CI 25.7-33.8) in the relaxation group and 30.0% (95% CI 24.0-36.0) in the control group. No statistically significant differences between the three groups were observed for any of the self-reported pain measures. CONCLUSION: In this large randomised controlled trial of a brief course in self-hypnosis to ease childbirth, no differences in use of epidural analgesia or pain experience were found across study groups.

DESIGN: Subgroup analysis of a previously published cohort and retrospective study. SETTING: Individuals registered in the Eindhoven Cancer Registry (ECR) between 1998 and 2007, linked to prescriptions of low-dose aspirin (80 mg) registered in a community pharmacy database. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred thirty-six individuals aged 70 and older diagnosed with colon cancer with or without aspirin use after diagnosis. MEASUREMENTS: Survival was analyzed with user status as a time-dependent covariate. Multivariate Poisson regression survival models were used to study the effect of aspirin on overall survival. RESULTS: One hundred seven participants (20.0%) started aspirin after being diagnosed with colon cancer; 429 (80.0%) were not prescribed aspirin. Three hundred thirty-nine participants (63.2%) had died by the end of follow-up. Aspirin use after diagnosis was associated with longer overall survival (rate ratio (RR) = 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.38-0.70, P < .001).

The CoBalT trial aimed to examine the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as an adjunct to usual care (including pharmacotherapy) for primary care patients with treatment resistant depression compared with usual care alone. METHODS: This two parallel-group multicentre randomised controlled trial recruited 469 patients aged 18-75 years with treatment resistant depression (on antidepressants for >/=6 weeks, Beck depression inventory [BDI] score >/=14 and international classification of diseases [ICD]-10 criteria for depression) from 73 UK general practices. Participants were randomised, with a computer generated code (stratified by centre and minimised according to baseline BDI score, whether the general practice had a counsellor, previous treatment with antidepressants, and duration of present episode of depression) to one of two groups: usual care or CBT in addition to usual care, and were followed up for 12 months. Because of the nature of the intervention it was not possible to mask participants, general practitioners, CBT therapists, or researchers to the treatment allocation. Analyses were by intention to treat. The primary outcome was response, defined as at least 50% reduction in depressive symptoms (BDI score) at 6 months compared with baseline. This trial is registered, ISRCTN38231611. FINDINGS: Between Nov 4, 2008, and Sept 30, 2010, we assigned 235 patients to usual care, and 234 to CBT plus usual care. 422 participants (90%) were followed up at 6 months and 396 (84%) at 12 months, finishing on Oct 31, 2011. 95 participants (46%) in the intervention group met criteria for response at 6 months compared with 46 (22%) in the usual care group (odds ratio 3.26, 95% CI 2.10-5.06, p<0.001). INTERPRETATION: Before this study, no evidence from large-scale randomised controlled trials was available for the effectiveness of augmentation of antidepressant medication with CBT as a next-step for patients whose depression has not responded to pharmacotherapy. Our study has provided robust evidence that CBT as an adjunct to usual care that includes antidepressants is an effective treatment, reducing depressive symptoms in this population.

23201382,Circumcision and lifetime risk of urinary tract infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,J Urol,Morris BJ and Wiswell TE,sydney,"PURPOSE: Urinary tract infection is common in infant males who are uncircumcised and can lead to renal parenchymal disease of the still growing pediatric kidney. Although the rate of urinary tract infection is highest in the first year of life, the cumulative incidence during the rest of the lifetime is under-recognized, but is expected to be nontrivial. Thus, any intervention that might prevent urinary tract infection would be expected to reduce suffering and medical costs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of 22 studies examining the single risk factor of lack of circumcision, then determined the prevalence and relative risk of urinary tract infection in different age groups (0 to 1, 1 to 16 and older than 16 years). From these data we estimated the lifetime prevalence. RESULTS: For age 0 to 1 year the relative risk was 9.91 (95% CI 7.49-13.1), for age 1 to 16 years RR was 6.56 (95% CI 3.26-13.2) and for older than 16 years it was 3.41-fold (95% CI 0.916-12.7) higher in uncircumcised males. We then calculated that 32.1% (95% CI 15.6-49.8) of uncircumcised males experience a urinary tract infection in their lifetime compared with 8.8% (95% CI 4.15-13.2) of circumcised males (RR 3.65, 95% CI 1.15-11.8). The number needed to treat was 4.29 (95% CI 2.20-27.2). CONCLUSIONS: The single risk factor of lack of circumcision confers a 23.3% chance of urinary tract infection during the lifetime. This greatly exceeds the prevalence of circumcision complications (1.5%), which are mostly minor. The potential seriousness of urinary tract infection supports circumcision as a desirable preventive health intervention in infant males.","Adolescent Adult Age Distribution Aged Australia Child Child, Preschool Circumcision, Male/*adverse effects/methods Confidence Intervals Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Middle Aged Prevalence Prognosis Risk Assessment Urinary Tract Infections/*epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology Young Adult"
23203539,Clinically important body weight gain following knee arthroplasty: a five-year comparative cohort study.,Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken),Riddle DL and Singh JA and Harmsen WS and Schleck CD and Lewallen DG,vcu,"OBJECTIVE: The impact of knee arthroplasty on body weight has not been fully explored. Clinically important weight gain following knee arthroplasty would pose potentially important health risks. METHODS: We used one of the largest US-based knee arthroplasty registries and a population-based control sample from the same geographic region to determine whether knee arthroplasty increases the risk of clinically important weight gain of >/=5% of baseline body weight over a 5-year postoperative period. RESULTS: Of the persons in the knee arthroplasty sample, 30.0% gained >/=5% of baseline body weight 5 years following surgery as compared to 19.7% of the control sample. The multivariable-adjusted (age, sex, body mass index, education, comorbidity, and presurgical weight change) odds ratio (OR) was 1.6 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.2-2.2) in persons with knee arthroplasty as compared to the control sample. Additional arthroplasty procedures during followup further increased the risk for weight gain (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.1) relative to the control sample. Specifically, among patients with knee arthroplasty, younger patients and those who lost greater amounts of weight in the 5-year preoperative period were at greater risk for clinically important weight gain. CONCLUSION: Patients who undergo knee arthroplasty are at an increased risk of clinically important weight gain following surgery. The findings potentially have broad implications to multiple members of the health care team. Future research should develop weight loss/maintenance interventions particularly for younger patients who have lost a substantial amount of weight prior to surgery, as they are most at risk for substantial postsurgical weight gain.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee/adverse effects/*trends Body Weight/*physiology Cohort Studies Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Middle Aged Registries Risk Factors Weight Gain/*physiology"
23210536,Is the introduction of anonymous delivery associated with a reduction of high neonaticide rates in Austria? A retrospective study.,BJOG,Klier CM and Grylli C and Amon S and Fiala C and Weizmann-Henelius G and Pruitt SL and Putkonen H,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To assess rates of neonaticide after the implementation of a preventative 'anonymous delivery' law in mid-2001 in Austria. Women are allowed to access antenatal care and give birth in a hospital anonymously, without showing any ID and free of charge. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: A complete census of police-reported neonaticides was obtained from the police statistics of Austria, Sweden and Finland. POPULATION: All neonaticides reported to the police, 1991-2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neonaticide rates before (1991-2001) and after (2002-2009) the introduction of anonymous delivery legislation per 100 000 births. METHODS: The Mann-Whitney U-test for two independent samples was used to compare neonaticide rates in the period before the new law was introduced with the rates observed after the implementation of the new law for each country. RESULTS: On average the rate of police-reported neonaticides was 7.2 per 100 000 births (SD 3.5, median 7.1) in Austria prior to the new law being passed, and 3.1 per 100 000 births (SD 2.1, median 2.6) after the law was passed. A significant decrease in neonaticide was observed in Austria after the implementation of anonymous delivery (Mann-Whitney U-test P = 0.017). Whereas the Finnish and Swedish rates were lower than the Austrian rates before and after the implementation of the Austrian law, they remained unchanged over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a significant decrease in the number of police-reported neonaticides in Austria after the implementation of anonymous delivery. Even though underlying factors associated with neonaticide are complex, the findings could indicate an effect of anonymous delivery in the prevention of this crime.","Austria/epidemiology Confidentiality/*legislation & jurisprudence Delivery, Obstetric/*legislation & jurisprudence/methods Female Finland/epidemiology Humans Infant, Newborn Infanticide/legislation & jurisprudence/*prevention & control/statistics & numerical data Pregnancy Prenatal Care/legislation & jurisprudence Retrospective Studies Sweden/epidemiology"

RESULTS: Among the 797 879 eligible enrollees, 149 018 individuals had open-angle glaucoma. The odds of undergoing visual field testing decreased for all groups from 2001 through 2009, decreasing most for Hispanic men and women (63% and 57%, respectively) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.31-0.43 and AOR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.37-0.50, respectively) and least (36%) for Asian American men (AOR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51-0.80). By comparison, the odds of undergoing other ocular imaging increased for all groups from 2001 through 2009, increasing most (173%) for black men and women (AOR, 2.73; 95% CI, 2.34-3.18 for men and AOR, 2.73; 95% CI, 2.40-3.09 for women) and least (77%) for Hispanic women (AOR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.49-2.09). CONCLUSION: Hispanic men and women had considerably reduced odds of undergoing visual field testing and other ocular imaging compared with other groups during the decade. Although increases in glaucoma testing have been noted in recent years among Hispanic men and women for some types of ancillary tests, efforts should be made to better understand and overcome some of the persistent barriers to monitoring for glaucoma in this group.","Aged Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological/*utilization Female Glaucoma, Open-Angle/*diagnosis Healthcare Disparities/*ethnology Humans Male Mass Screening/*trends Middle Aged *Population Surveillance Scanning Laser Polarimetry Tomography, Optical Coherence United States"
23207407,The impact of cesarean section on offspring overweight and obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Int J Obes (Lond),Li HT and Zhou YB and Liu JM,Missing,"Studies have reported inconsistent results concerning the association of cesarean section with offspring obesity. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine whether cesarean section increases the risk of later overweight and obesity. Pubmed, Embase and Web of Science were searched using different combinations of two groups of keywords: 'cesarean' and 'overweight/obesity'. Cohort or case-control studies that reported the association of cesarean section with childhood (3-8 years), adolescence (9-18 years) and/or adult (>19 years) overweight/obesity were eligible. Where possible, adjusted risk estimates were pooled using a random effects model; otherwise unadjusted estimates were pooled. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed with I(2) statistics; the values of 25%, 50% and 75% were considered to indicate low, medium and high heterogeneity, respectively. We conducted a subgroup analysis to identify the sources of heterogeneity according to study quality defined on the basis of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. In total, two case-control and seven cohort studies were identified for the literature review and 15 separate risk estimates were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled odds ratio (OR) of overweight/obesity for offspring delivered by cesarean section compared with those born vaginally was 1.33 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19, 1.48; I(2)=63%); the OR was 1.32 (1.15, 1.51) for children, 1.24 (1.00, 1.54) for adolescents and 1.50 (1.02, 2.20) for adults. In subgroup analysis, the overall pooled OR was 1.18 (1.09, 1.27; I(2)=29%) for high-quality studies and 1.78 (1.43, 2.22; I(2)=24%) for medium-quality (P for interaction=0.0005); no low-quality studies were identified. The ORs for children, adolescents and adults all tended to be lower for high-quality studies compared with medium-quality studies. Our results indicated that cesarean section was moderately associated with offspring overweight and obesity. This finding has public health implications, given the increase in cesarean births in many countries.","Adolescent Body Mass Index Cesarean Section/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data Child Child, Preschool China/epidemiology Disease Susceptibility Female Humans Male Odds Ratio Overweight/*epidemiology/etiology Pediatric Obesity/epidemiology Pregnancy Public Health Risk Factors"

This study examined the effect of a video decision support tool on CPR preferences among patients with advanced cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a randomized controlled trial of 150 patients with advanced cancer from four oncology centers. Participants in the control arm (n = 80) listened to a verbal narrative describing CPR and the likelihood of successful resuscitation. Participants in the intervention arm (n = 70) listened to the identical narrative and viewed a 3-minute video depicting a patient on a ventilator and CPR being performed on a simulated patient. The primary outcome was participants' preference for or against CPR measured immediately after exposure to either modality. Secondary outcomes were participants' knowledge of CPR (score range of 0 to 4, with higher score indicating more knowledge) and comfort with video. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 62 years (standard deviation, 11 years); 49% were women, 44% were African American or Latino, and 47% had lung or colon cancer. After the verbal narrative, in the control arm, 38 participants (48%) wanted CPR, 41 (51%) wanted no CPR, and one (1%) was uncertain. In contrast, in the intervention arm, 14 participants (20%) wanted CPR, 55 (79%) wanted no CPR, and 1 (1%) was uncertain (unadjusted odds ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.7 to 7.2; P < .001). Mean knowledge scores were higher in the intervention arm than in the control arm (3.3 +/- 1.0 v 2.6 +/- 1.3, respectively; P < .001), and 65 participants (93%) in the intervention arm were comfortable watching the video. CONCLUSION: Participants with advanced cancer who viewed a video of CPR were less likely to opt for CPR than those who listened to a verbal narrative.",*Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation *Decision Making Female Humans Male Neoplasms/complications/*psychology Patient Preference/*psychology Terminal Care/*methods *Videotape Recording

Duration, cost and resistance of many patients towards a psychological therapy have limited their acceptance. AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of a psycho-educational intervention on IBS symptoms. METHODS: Sixty-nine IBS patients (72% female) were randomised to an intervention or a wait-list control group. The IBS class consisted of education on a biological mind body disease model emphasising self-efficacy and practical relaxation techniques. RESULTS: Patients in the intervention showed significant improvement on GI symptom severity, visceral sensitivity, depression and QoL postintervention and most of these gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up (Hedge's g = -0.46-0.77). Moderated mediation analyses indicated change in anxiety, visceral sensitivity, QoL and catastrophising due to the intervention had moderate mediation effects (Hedge's g = -0.38 to -0.60) on improvements in GI symptom severity for patients entering the trial with low to average QoL. Also, change in GI symptom severity due to the intervention had moderate mediation effects on improvements in QoL especially in patients with low to average levels of QoL at baseline. Moderated mediation analyses indicated mediation was less effective for patients entering the intervention with high QoL. CONCLUSIONS: A brief psycho-educational group intervention is efficacious in changing cognitions and fears about the symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome, and these changes are associated with clinically meaningful improvement in symptoms and quality of life. The intervention seems particularly tailored to patients with low to moderate quality of life baseline levels.","Adult Female Humans Irritable Bowel Syndrome/psychology/*therapy Male Meditation/*methods Middle Aged Patient Education as Topic/*methods Psychotherapy, Group/*methods Quality of Life Severity of Illness Index Treatment Outcome Waiting Lists"

23218508,Effect of emergency department crowding on outcomes of admitted patients.,Ann Emerg Med,Sun BC and Hsia RY and Weiss RE and Zingmond D and Liang LJ and Han W and McCreath H and Asch SM,ohsu,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Emergency department (ED) crowding is a prevalent health delivery problem and may adversely affect the outcomes of patients requiring admission. We assess the association of ED crowding with subsequent outcomes in a general population of hospitalized patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of patients admitted in 2007 through the EDs of nonfederal, acute care hospitals in California. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay and costs. ED crowding was established by the proxy measure of ambulance diversion hours on the day of admission. To control for hospital-level confounders of ambulance diversion, we defined periods of high ED crowding as those days within the top quartile of diversion hours for a specific facility. Hierarchic regression models controlled for demographics, time variables, patient comorbidities, primary diagnosis, and hospital fixed effects. We used bootstrap sampling to estimate excess outcomes attributable to ED crowding. RESULTS: We studied 995,379 ED visits resulting in admission to 187 hospitals. Patients who were admitted on days with high ED crowding experienced 5% greater odds of inpatient death (95% confidence interval [CI] 2% to 8%), 0.8% longer hospital length of stay (95% CI 0.5% to 1%), and 1% increased costs per admission (95% CI 0.7% to 2%). Excess outcomes attributable to periods of high ED crowding included 300 inpatient deaths (95% CI 200 to 500 inpatient deaths), 6,200 hospital days (95% CI 2,800 to 8,900 hospital days), and $17 million (95% CI $11 to $23 million) in costs. CONCLUSION: Periods of high ED crowding were associated with increased inpatient mortality and modest increases in length of stay and costs for admitted patients.","California *Crowding Emergency Service, Hospital/economics/standards/*statistics & numerical data Female Hospital Costs/statistics & numerical data Hospital Mortality Humans Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data Male Outcome Assessment (Health Care)/*statistics & numerical data Retrospective Studies"

METHODS: The electronic databases PubMed/MEDLINE and PsychInfo/APA PsycNET were utilized to search for terms including 'Cardiac Arrest', 'Therapeutic Hypothermia' and 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'Quality of Life', 'Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)', 'Psychological Outcomes', 'Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)', and 'Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)'. RESULTS: High rates of psychological distress have been reported after OHCA. Specifically, incidence rates of depression have ranged from 14% to 45%; anxiety rates have ranged from 13% to 61%; PTSD rates reportedly range from 19% to 27%. Variability between studies is likely attributable to methodological variations relating to measures used, time since arrest, and research setting. DISCUSSION: Given the occurrence rate of psychological distress after OHCA, psychological screening and early intervention seems indicated in the cardiac arrest population. Further studies are needed to better establish occurrence rates in both inpatient and outpatient settings, determine appropriate measures and normative cut off scores, and decide on the most appropriate method of intervention.","Anxiety/*etiology Depression/*etiology Heart Arrest/*psychology Humans Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*etiology Stress, Psychological/etiology"

However, it remains unknown whether cells within single genetic clones are functionally equivalent. By combining DNA copy number alteration (CNA) profiling, sequencing, and lentiviral lineage tracking, we followed the repopulation dynamics of 150 single lentivirus-marked lineages from 10 human colorectal cancers through serial xenograft passages in mice. CNA and mutational analysis distinguished individual clones and showed that clones remained stable upon serial transplantation. Despite this stability, the proliferation, persistence, and chemotherapy tolerance of lentivirally marked lineages were variable within each clone. Chemotherapy promoted the dominance of previously minor or dormant lineages. Thus, apart from genetic diversity, tumor cells display inherent functional variability in tumor propagation potential, which contributes to both cancer growth and therapy tolerance.","Animals Cell Lineage Cell Tracking Clonal Evolution/*genetics Clone Cells Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology DNA Copy Number Variations Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics Humans Lentivirus Mice Neoplasm Transplantation Transcriptome Transduction, Genetic Tumor Cells, Cultured"
23474859,Mistaken advocacy against twin pregnancies following IVF.,J Assist Reprod Genet,Gleicher N and Bard DH,Missing,"PURPOSE: A recent publication by Swedish Colleagues in Fertility & Sterility for the first time, statistically correctly, attempted to assess risks of twin IVF pregnancies in comparison to two consecutive singleton IVF pregnancies. Historic comparisons have been statistically incorrect, comparing risks of one twin to one singleton pregnancy. We here analyze data and conclusions presented in this Swedish study. METHODS: We reviewed the manuscript by Sazonova et al. (Fertil Steril, 2013) (doi: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.11.023 ). RESULTS: Based on incorrect statistical methodology, twins after in vitro fertilization (IVF) have come under attack as ""adverse"" outcomes. Above noted study recently, for the first time, correctly compared one twin to two consecutive singleton pregnancies. Investigators, however, in our opinion interpreted their own data incorrectly by claiming ""dramatically"" higher maternal and neonatal risks in twin pregnancies. Our interpretation of reported data, indeed, in contrast suggests surprisingly minor differences in observed twin-risks. Moreover, such minor risk increases do not offer adequate compensatory benefits for significantly lower pregnancy chances in first IVF cycles with eSET in comparison to two-embryo transfers (2-ET). CONCLUSIONS: As significantly higher maternal and neonatal risks of twin IVF pregnancies represent the principal rationale for eSET, the Swedish study actually suggests that eSET offers neither patient-friendly nor cost-effective treatment options for IVF, except where patients object to twins or have medical contraindications. The need for a second pregnancy to achieve equal outcome (2 children), resulting treatment delays, increased efforts and costs, in absence of any guarantees that a second successful singleton pregnancy/delivery will ever be accomplished, invalidates eSET as a routine procedure.","Female Fertilization in Vitro/*psychology Humans Patient Advocacy Pregnancy Pregnancy, Twin/*psychology Risk Factors"
23228926,Incidence of myocardial infarction with shifts to and from daylight savings time.,Am J Cardiol,Jiddou MR and Pica M and Boura J and Qu L and Franklin BA,Missing,"Modulators of normal bodily functions such as the duration and quality of sleep might transiently influence cardiovascular risk. The transition to daylight savings time (DST) has been associated with a short-term increased incidence ratio (IR) of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The present retrospective study examined the IR of AMIs that presented to our hospitals the week after DST and after the autumn switch to standard time, October 2006 to April 2012, with specific reference to the AMI type. Our study population (n = 935 patients; 59% men, 41% women) was obtained from the electronic medical records of the Royal Oak and Troy campuses of the Beaumont Hospitals in Michigan. Overall, the frequency of AMI was similar in the spring and autumn, 463 (49.5%) and 472 (50.5%), respectively. The IR for the first week after the spring shift was 1.17 (95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.36). After the transition from DST in the autumn, the IR for the same period was lower, but not significantly different, 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.16). Nevertheless, the greatest increase in AMI occurred on the first day (Sunday) after the spring shift to DST (1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 2.02; p <0.05). Also, a significantly greater incidence was found of non-ST-segment myocardial infarction after the transition to DST in the study group compared with that in the control group (p = 0.022). In conclusion, these data suggest that shifts to and from DST might transiently affect the incidence and type of acute cardiac events, albeit modestly.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Circadian Rhythm Confidence Intervals Electrocardiography Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Male Michigan/epidemiology Middle Aged Myocardial Infarction/*epidemiology/etiology *Periodicity Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Time Factors"
23254892,Dietary patterns and colorectal adenomas in Lynch syndrome: the GEOLynch cohort study.,Cancer,Botma A and Vasen HF and van Duijnhoven FJ and Kleibeuker JH and Nagengast FM and Kampman E,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Patients with Lynch syndrome (LS) have a high risk of developing colorectal cancer due to mutations in mismatch repair genes. Because dietary factors, alone and in combination, influence sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis, the association of dietary patterns with colorectal adenomas in LS patients was assessed. METHODS: In the GEOLynch cohort of 486 persons with LS, dietary information was collected, using a food frequency questionnaire. Dietary pattern scores were obtained by principal components analysis. Hazard ratios (HR) between dietary patterns and colorectal adenomas were calculated using Cox regression models. Robust sandwich variance estimates were used to control for dependency within families. Final models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking habits, colorectal adenoma history, and extent of colon resection. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 20 months, colorectal adenomas were detected in 58 persons. Four dietary patterns were identified: a ""Prudent,"" ""Meat,"" ""Snack,"" and ""Cosmopolitan"" pattern. Individuals within the highest tertile of the ""Prudent"" pattern had a HR of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-1.66) for colorectal adenomas, compared with the lowest tertile. Those with high ""Meat"" pattern scores had a HR of 1.70 (95% CI, 0.83-3.52). A high ""Snack"" pattern was associated with an increased risk of colorectal adenomas (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.03-4.49). A HR of 1.25 (95% CI, 0.61-2.55) was observed for persons in the highest tertile of the ""Cosmopolitan"" pattern. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that dietary patterns may be associated with development of colorectal adenoma in patients with Lynch syndrome. The directions of these findings are corroborative with those observed in studies investigating sporadic colorectal cancer.","Adenoma/*epidemiology/etiology Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies Colorectal Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology Colorectal Neoplasms, Hereditary Nonpolyposis/complications/*epidemiology *Diet Surveys/statistics & numerical data Feeding Behavior/*physiology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Risk Factors Young Adult"
23247937,Associations between reduced hospital length of stay and 30-day readmission rate and mortality: 14-year experience in 129 Veterans Affairs hospitals.,Ann Intern Med,Kaboli PJ and Go JT and Hockenberry J and Glasgow JM and Johnson SR and Rosenthal GE and Jones MP and Vaughan-Sarrazin M,va,"BACKGROUND: Reducing length of stay (LOS) has been a priority for hospitals and health care systems. However, there is concern that this reduction may result in increased hospital readmissions. OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in hospital LOS and 30-day readmission rates for all medical diagnoses combined and 5 specific common diagnoses in the Veterans Health Administration. DESIGN: Observational study from 1997 to 2010. SETTING: All 129 acute care Veterans Affairs hospitals in the United States. PATIENTS: 4,124,907 medical admissions with subsamples of 2 chronic diagnoses (heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and 3 acute diagnoses (acute myocardial infarction, community-acquired pneumonia, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage). MEASUREMENTS: Unadjusted LOS and 30-day readmission rates with multivariable regression analyses to adjust for patient demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, and admitting hospitals. RESULTS: For all medical diagnoses combined, risk-adjusted mean hospital LOS decreased by 1.46 days from 5.44 to 3.98 days, or 2% annually (P < 0.001). Reductions in LOS were also observed for the 5 specific common diagnoses, with greatest reductions for acute myocardial infarction (2.85 days) and community-acquired pneumonia (2.22 days). Over the 14 years, risk-adjusted 30-day readmission rates for all medical diagnoses combined decreased from 16.5% to 13.8% (P < 0.001). Reductions in readmissions were also observed for the 5 specific common diagnoses, with greatest reductions for acute myocardial infarction (22.6% to 19.8%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (17.9% to 14.6%). All-cause mortality 90 days after admission was reduced by 3% annually. Of note, hospitals with mean risk-adjusted LOS that was lower than expected had a higher readmission rate, suggesting a modest tradeoff between hospital LOS and readmission (6% increase for each day lower than expected). LIMITATIONS: This study is limited to the Veterans Health Administration system; non-Veterans Affairs admissions were not available. No measure of readmission preventability was used. CONCLUSION: Veterans Affairs hospitals demonstrated simultaneous improvements in hospital LOS and readmissions over 14 years, suggesting that as LOS improved, hospital readmission did not increase. This is important because hospital readmission is being used as a quality indicator and may result in payment incentives. Future work should explore these relationships to see whether a tipping point exists for LOS reduction and hospital readmission.

23248224,The relationship between cow's milk and stores of vitamin D and iron in early childhood.,Pediatrics,Maguire JL and Lebovic G and Kandasamy S and Khovratovich M and Mamdani M and Birken CS and Parkin PC,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between cow's milk intake on both vitamin D and iron stores in healthy urban preschoolers. METHODS: Healthy children 2 to 5 years of age were recruited from December 2008 through December 2010 through the TARGet Kids! practice-based research network. Cow's milk intake was measured by parental report. Vitamin D and iron stores were measured by using serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and ferritin. Bivariate multivariable linear regression was used to examine the effect of cow's milk intake simultaneously on 25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum ferritin. Analyses were stratified by important clinical variables including skin pigmentation, bottle feeding, vitamin D supplementation, and season. RESULTS: Among 1311 children, increasing cow's milk consumption was associated with decreasing serum ferritin (P < .0001) and increasing 25-hydroxyvitamin D (P </= .0001). Two cups (500 mL) of cow's milk per day maintained 25-hydroxyvitamin D >75 nmol/L with minimal negative effect on serum ferritin for most children. Children with darker skin pigmentation not receiving vitamin D supplementation during the winter required 3 to 4 cups of cow's milk per day to maintain 25-hydroxyvitamin D >75 nmol/L. Cow's milk intake among children using a bottle did not increase 25-hydroxyvitamin D and resulted in more dramatic decreases in serum ferritin. CONCLUSIONS: There is a trade-off between increasing 25-hydroxyvitamin D and decreasing serum ferritin with increasing milk intake. Two cups of cow's milk per day appears sufficient to maintain healthy vitamin D and iron stores for most children. Wintertime vitamin D supplementation was particularly important among children with darker skin pigmentation.","Animals Cattle Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Female Ferritins/*blood Humans Iron/*blood Male Milk/*metabolism Skin Pigmentation/*physiology Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/blood"

OBJECTIVE: To compare risk for advanced colorectal neoplasia at 1-year colonoscopy among patients cross-classified by U.S. and U.K. surveillance guidelines. DESIGN: Pooled analysis of 4 prospective studies between 1984 and 1998. SETTING: Academic and private clinics in the United States. PATIENTS: 3226 postpolypectomy patients with 6- to 18-month follow-up colonoscopy. MEASUREMENTS: Rates of advanced neoplasia (an adenoma >/=1 cm, high-grade dysplasia, >25% villous architecture, or invasive cancer) at 1 year, compared across U.S. and U.K. risk categories. RESULTS: Advanced neoplasia was detected 1 year after polypectomy in 3.8% (95% CI, 2.7% to 4.9%) of lower-risk patients and 11.2% (CI, 9.8% to 12.6%) of higher-risk patients by U.S. criteria. According to U.K. criteria, 4.4% (CI, 3.3% to 5.4%) of low-risk patients, 9.9% (CI, 8.3% to 11.5%) of intermediate-risk patients, and 18.7% (CI, 14.8% to 22.5%) of high-risk patients presented with advanced neoplasia; U.K. high-risk patients comprised 12.1% of all patients. All U.S. lower-risk patients were low-risk by U.K. criteria; however, more patients were classified as low-risk, because the U.K. guidelines do not consider histologic features. Higher-risk U.S. patients were distributed across the 3 U.K. categories. Among all patients with advanced neoplasia, 26.3% were reclassified by the U.K. criteria to a higher-risk category and 7.0% to a lower-risk category, with a net 19.0% benefiting from detection 2 years earlier. Overall, substitution of U.K. for U.S. guidelines resulted in an estimated 0.03 additional colonoscopy every 5 years per patient. LIMITATIONS: Patients were enrolled 15 to 20 years ago, and quality measures for colonoscopy were unavailable. Patients lacking follow-up colonoscopy or with surveillance colonoscopy after 6 to 18 months and those with cancer or insufficient baseline adenoma characteristics were excluded (2076 of 5302). CONCLUSION: Application of the U.K. guidelines in the United States could identify a subset of high-risk patients who may warrant a 1-year clearing colonoscopy without substantially increasing rates of colonoscopy.

In September 2012, we initiated an investigation into fungal infections associated with injections of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate that was purchased from a single compounding pharmacy. METHODS: Three lots of methylprednisolone acetate were recalled by the pharmacy; examination of unopened vials later revealed fungus. Notification of all persons potentially exposed to implicated methylprednisolone acetate was conducted by federal, state, and local public health officials and by staff at clinical facilities that administered the drug. We collected clinical data on standardized case-report forms, and we tested for the presence of fungi in isolates and specimens by examining cultures and performing polymerase-chain-reaction assays and histopathological and immunohistochemical testing. RESULTS: By October 19, 2012, more than 99% of 13,534 potentially exposed persons had been contacted. As of July 1, 2013, there were 749 reported cases of infection in 20 states, with 61 deaths (8%). Laboratory evidence of Exserohilum rostratum was present in specimens from 153 case patients (20%). Additional data were available for 728 case patients (97%); 229 of these patients (31%) had meningitis with no other documented infection. Case patients had received a median of 1 injection (range, 1 to 6) of implicated methylprednisolone acetate. The median age of the patients was 64 years (range, 15 to 97), and the median incubation period (the number of days from the last injection to the date of the first diagnosis) was 47 days (range, 0 to 249); 40 patients (5%) had a stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of data from a large, multistate outbreak of fungal infections showed substantial morbidity and mortality.

Here we show that lamin A interacts with and activates SIRT1. SIRT1 exhibits reduced association with nuclear matrix (NM) and decreased deacetylase activity in the presence of progerin or prelamin A, leading to rapid depletion of adult stem cells (ASCs) in Zmpste24(-/-) mice. Resveratrol enhances the binding between SIRT1 and A-type lamins to increases its deacetylase activity. Resveratrol treatment rescues ASC decline, slows down body weight loss, improves trabecular bone structure and mineral density, and significantly extends the life span in Zmpste24(-/-) mice. Our data demonstrate lamin A as an activator of SIRT1 and provide a mechanistic explanation for the activation of SIRT1 by resveratrol. The link between conserved SIRT1 longevity pathway and progeria suggests a stem cell-based and SIRT1 pathway-dependent therapeutic strategy for progeria.","Adult Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism Animals Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology Cell Line Enzyme Activation/drug effects HEK293 Cells Humans Lamin Type A/genetics/*metabolism Longevity Membrane Proteins/deficiency/genetics/metabolism Metalloendopeptidases/deficiency/genetics/metabolism Mice Mice, Knockout Nuclear Matrix/metabolism Nuclear Proteins/metabolism Progeria/metabolism/*pathology Protein Binding Protein Precursors/metabolism Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology Sirtuin 1/genetics/*metabolism Stilbenes/*pharmacology"
23230313,Chest compression alone cardiopulmonary resuscitation is associated with better long-term survival compared with standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation.,Circulation,Dumas F and Rea TD and Fahrenbruch C and Rosenqvist M and Faxen J and Svensson L and Eisenberg MS and Bohm K,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the long-term survival effects of type-specific bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the community. We hypothesized that dispatcher instruction consisting of chest compression alone would be associated with better overall long-term prognosis in comparison with chest compression plus rescue breathing. METHODS AND RESULTS: The investigation was a retrospective cohort study that combined 2 randomized trials comparing the short-term survival effects of dispatcher CPR instruction consisting either of chest compression alone or chest compression plus rescue breathing. Long-term vital status was ascertained by using the respective National and State death records through July 31, 2011. We performed Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression to evaluate survival according to the type of CPR instruction. Of the 2496 subjects included in the current investigation, 1243 (50%) were randomly assigned to chest compression alone and 1253 (50%) were randomly assigned to chest compression plus rescue breathing. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 CPR groups. During the 1153.2 person-years of follow-up, there were 2260 deaths and 236 long-term survivors. Randomization to chest compression alone in comparison with chest compression plus rescue breathing was associated with a lower risk of death after adjustment for potential confounders (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.99; P=0.02).

23235198,"Consumption of whole grain reduces risk of deteriorating glucose tolerance, including progression to prediabetes.",Am J Clin Nutr,Wirstrom T and Hilding A and Gu HF and Ostenson CG and Bjorklund A,Missing,"BACKGROUND: High whole-grain intake has been reportedly associated with reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), which is an effect possibly subject to genetic effect modification. Confirmation in prospective studies and investigations on the impact on prediabetes is needed. OBJECTIVES: In a prospective population-based study, we investigated whether a higher intake of whole grain protects against the development of prediabetes and T2D and tested for modulation by polymorphisms of the TCF7L2 gene. DESIGN: We examined the 8-10-y incidence of prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, or the combination of both) and T2D in relation to the intake of whole grain. Baseline data were available for 3180 women and 2297 men aged 35-56 y. RESULTS: A higher intake of whole grain (>59.1 compared with <30.6 g/d) was associated with a 34% lower risk to deteriorate in glucose tolerance (to prediabetes or T2D; women and men combined). The association remained after adjustments for age, family history of diabetes, BMI, physical activity, smoking, education, and blood pressure (OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.96). Risk reduction was significant in men (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.85) but not in women. Associations were significant for prediabetes per se (all, OR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.94; men, OR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.80). The intake of whole grain correlated inversely with insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The impact of whole-grain intake was undetectable in men who harbored diabetogenic polymorphisms of the TCF7L2 gene. CONCLUSIONS: A higher intake of whole grain is associated with decreased risk of deteriorating glucose tolerance including progression from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes by mechanisms likely tied to effects on insulin sensitivity. Effect modifications by TCF7L2 genetic polymorphisms are supported.","Adult Cereals/*chemistry Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/physiopathology/prevention & control Dietary Fiber/*administration & dosage *Disease Progression Female Follow-Up Studies Genotype Glucose Intolerance/diet therapy/physiopathology/*prevention & control Humans Insulin/secretion Insulin Resistance Male Middle Aged Prediabetic State/diet therapy/physiopathology/*prevention & control Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein/genetics/metabolism"
23248234,Association of nutrient-dense snack combinations with calories and vegetable intake.,Pediatrics,Wansink B and Shimizu M and Brumberg A,cornell,"BACKGROUND: With other factors such as general diet and insufficient exercise, eating non-nutrient dense snack foods such as potato chips contributes to childhood obesity. We examined whether children consumed fewer calories when offered high-nutrient dense snacks consisting of cheese and vegetables than children who were offered non-nutrient dense snacks (ie, potato chips). METHODS: Two hundred one children (115 girls) entering the third to sixth grades were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 snacking conditions: (1) potato chips only, (2) cheese-only, (3) vegetables only, and (4) cheese and vegetables. Children were allowed to eat snacks freely provided while watching 45-minute TV programs. Satiety was measured before they started eating snacks, in the middle of the study, and 20 minutes after they finished eating the snacks. Parents completed a questionnaire regarding their family environment. RESULTS: Children consumed 72% fewer calories when eating a combined snack compared with when they were served potato chips, P < .001. Children who ate the combination snack needed significantly fewer calories to achieve satiety than those who ate potato chips, P < .001. The effects of the snack conditions on caloric intake were more pronounced among overweight or obese children (P = .02) and those from low-involvement families (P = .049) CONCLUSIONS: The combination snack of vegetables and cheese can be an effective means for children to reduce caloric intake while snacking.

23228385,Online reviews of 500 urologists.,J Urol,Ellimoottil C and Hart A and Greco K and Quek ML and Farooq A,lumc,"PURPOSE: Patient demand for easily accessible information about physician quality has led to the development of physician review websites. These sites concern some physicians who argue that ratings can be misleading. In this study we describe the landscape of online reviews of urologists by looking at a sample of ratings and written reviews from popular physician review websites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 500 urologists were randomly selected from a database of 9,940. Numerical ratings from 10 popular physician review websites were collected for each physician and analyzed. Written reviews from a single physician review website were also collected and then categorized as extremely negative/positive, negative/positive or neutral. RESULTS: Our sample consisted of 471 male and 29 female urologists from 39 states including small and large cities and 4 census regions. There were 398 (79.6%) urologists who had at least 1 rating on any of the 10 physician review websites (range 0 to 64). On average the composite rating was based on scores from only 2.4 submitted ratings. Most physicians had positive ratings (86%), with 36% having highly positive ratings. No difference was seen in the median number of reviews when gender (p = 0.72), region (p = 0.87) and city size (p = 0.87) were compared. Written reviews were mostly positive or extremely positive (53%). CONCLUSIONS: We advise physicians and patients to be aware that most urologists are rated on at least 1 physician review website, and while most ratings and reviews are favorable, composite scores are typically based on a small number of reviews and, therefore, can be volatile.","Adult *Clinical Competence Female Humans Information Dissemination Information Services/utilization Internet/*utilization Male Middle Aged Patient Satisfaction/statistics & numerical data *Quality Indicators, Health Care Total Quality Management United States Urology/manpower/*standards"

DESIGN: Cross-lagged path analysis was used to identify the temporal order of vulnerability for psychosis and cannabis use, while controlling for gender, family psychopathology, alcohol use and tobacco use. SETTING: A large prospective population study of Dutch adolescents [the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS) study]. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2120 adolescents with assessments at (mean) age 13.6, age 16.3 and age 19.1. MEASUREMENTS: Vulnerability for psychosis at the three assessment points was represented by latent factors derived from scores on three scales of the Youth Self-Report and the Adult Self-Report, i.e. thought problems, social problems and attention problems. Participants self-reported on cannabis use during the past year at all three waves. FINDINGS: Significant associations (r = 0.12-0.23) were observed between psychosis vulnerability and cannabis use at all assessments. Also, cannabis use at age 16 predicted psychosis vulnerability at age 19 (Z = 2.6, P < 0.05). Furthermore, psychosis vulnerability at ages 13 (Z = 2.0, P < 0.05) and 16 (Z = 3.0, P < 0.05) predicted cannabis use at, respectively, ages 16 and 19.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a survey-based, multisite study conducted from March 2006 through January 2009. All eligible patients with advanced cancer receiving palliative radiation therapy and oncology physician and nurses at four Boston academic centers were approached for study participation; 75 patients (response rate = 73%) and 339 nurses and physicians (response rate = 63%) participated. The survey assessed practical and operational dimensions of SC, including eight SC examples. Outcomes assessed five factors hypothesized to contribute to SC infrequency. RESULTS: Most patients with advanced cancer had never received any form of spiritual care from their oncology nurses or physicians (87% and 94%, respectively; P for difference = .043). Majorities of patients indicated that SC is an important component of cancer care from nurses and physicians (86% and 87%, respectively; P = .1). Most nurses and physicians thought that SC should at least occasionally be provided (87% and 80%, respectively; P = .16). Majorities of patients, nurses, and physicians endorsed the appropriateness of eight examples of SC (averages, 78%, 93%, and 87%, respectively; P = .01). In adjusted analyses, the strongest predictor of SC provision by nurses and physicians was reception of SC training (odds ratio [OR] = 11.20, 95% CI, 1.24 to 101; and OR = 7.22, 95% CI, 1.91 to 27.30, respectively). Most nurses and physicians had not received SC training (88% and 86%, respectively; P = .83). CONCLUSION: Patients, nurses, and physicians view SC as an important, appropriate, and beneficial component of EOL care. SC infrequency may be primarily due to lack of training, suggesting that SC training is critical to meeting national EOL care guidelines.",Adult Aged Analysis of Variance Attitude of Health Personnel Boston Female Humans Linear Models Logistic Models Male Middle Aged *Neoplasms/therapy *Nurses Oncology Nursing/methods/standards/trends Palliative Care Pastoral Care *Physicians Quality of Health Care Questionnaires Religion and Medicine Social Perception *Spirituality *Terminal Care/methods/standards/trends *Terminally Ill/psychology/statistics & numerical data
23128366,A randomized comparison of print and web communication on colorectal cancer screening.,JAMA Intern Med,Weinberg DS and Keenan E and Ruth K and Devarajan K and Rodoletz M and Bieber EJ,fccc,"BACKGROUND: New methods to enhance colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates are needed. The web offers novel possibilities to educate patients and to improve health behaviors, such as cancer screening. Evidence supports the efficacy of health communications that are targeted and tailored to improve the uptake of recommendations. METHODS: We identified unscreened women at average risk for CRC from the scheduling databases of obstetrics and gynecology practices in 2 large health care systems. Participants consented to a randomized controlled trial that compared CRC screening uptake after receipt of CRC screening information delivered via the web or in print form. Participants could also be assigned to a control (usual care) group. Women in the interventional arms received tailored information in a high- or low-monitoring Cognitive Social Information Processing model-defined attentional style. The primary outcome was CRC screening participation at 4 months. RESULTS: A total of 904 women were randomized to the interventional or control group. At 4 months, CRC screening uptake was not significantly different in the web (12.2%), print (12.0%), or control (12.9%) group. Attentional style had no effect on screening uptake for any group. Some baseline participant factors were associated with greater screening, including higher income (P = .03), stage of change (P < .001), and physician recommendation to screen (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: A web-based educational intervention was no more effective than a print-based one or control (no educational intervention) in increasing CRC screening rates in women at average risk of CRC. Risk messages tailored to attentional style had no effect on screening uptake. In average-risk populations, use of the Internet for health communication without additional enhancement is unlikely to improve screening participation.

We therefore compared patterns of PRT use, cost, and early toxicity among Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer with those of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of all Medicare beneficiaries aged greater than or equal to 66 years who received PRT or IMRT for prostate cancer during 2008 and/or 2009. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with receipt of PRT. To assess toxicity, each PRT patient was matched with two IMRT patients with similar clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. The main outcome measures were receipt of PRT or IMRT, Medicare reimbursement for each treatment, and early genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and other toxicity. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We identified 27,647 men; 553 (2%) received PRT and 27,094 (98%) received IMRT. Patients receiving PRT were younger, healthier, and from more affluent areas than patients receiving IMRT. Median Medicare reimbursement was $32,428 for PRT and $18,575 for IMRT. Although PRT was associated with a statistically significant reduction in genitourinary toxicity at 6 months compared with IMRT (5.9% vs 9.5%; odds ratio [OR] = 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38 to 0.96, P = .03), at 12 months post-treatment there was no difference in genitourinary toxicity (18.8% vs 17.5%; OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.76 to 1.54, P = .66). There was no statistically significant difference in gastrointestinal or other toxicity at 6 months or 12 months post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although PRT is substantially more costly than IMRT, there was no difference in toxicity in a comprehensive cohort of Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer at 12 months post-treatment.","Aged Aged, 80 and over *Direct Service Costs Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation Humans Male Medicare Odds Ratio Prostatic Neoplasms/economics/*radiotherapy Proton Therapy/*adverse effects/*economics Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated/*adverse effects/*economics Retrospective Studies Treatment Outcome United States Urogenital System/*radiation effects"

To test this we constructed inducible models of ELF5 expression in ER positive luminal breast cancer cells and interrogated them using transcript profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation of DNA followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq). ELF5 suppressed ER and FOXA1 expression and broadly suppressed ER-driven patterns of gene expression including sets of genes distinguishing the luminal molecular subtype. Direct transcriptional targets of ELF5, which included FOXA1, EGFR, and MYC, accurately classified a large cohort of breast cancers into their intrinsic molecular subtypes, predicted ER status with high precision, and defined groups with differential prognosis. Knockdown of ELF5 in basal breast cancer cell lines suppressed basal patterns of gene expression and produced a shift in molecular subtype toward the claudin-low and normal-like groups. Luminal breast cancer cells that acquired resistance to the antiestrogen Tamoxifen showed greatly elevated levels of ELF5 and its transcriptional signature, and became dependent on ELF5 for proliferation, compared to the parental cells. Thus ELF5 provides a key transcriptional determinant of breast cancer molecular subtype by suppression of estrogen sensitivity in luminal breast cancer cells and promotion of basal characteristics in basal breast cancer cells, an action that may be utilised to acquire antiestrogen resistance.","Animals Binding Sites Breast Neoplasms/classification/genetics/*metabolism/pathology Cell Adhesion/drug effects Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation/drug effects Chromatin Immunoprecipitation DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects Estrogens/*pharmacology Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects Genome, Human/genetics Humans Mice Models, Biological Phenotype Protein Binding/drug effects/genetics Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/genetics/*metabolism Sequence Analysis, DNA Transcription, Genetic/drug effects"

Current median time from hospital discharge to enrollment is 35 days. We hypothesized that an appointment within 10 days would improve attendance at CR orientation. METHODS AND RESULTS: At hospital discharge, 148 patients with a nonsurgical qualifying diagnosis for CR were randomized to receive a CR orientation appointment either within 10 days (early) or at 35 days (standard). The primary end point was attendance at CR orientation. Secondary outcome measures were attendance at >/=1 exercise session, the total number of exercise sessions attended, completion of CR, and change in exercise training workload while in CR. Average age was 60+/-12 years; 56% of participants were male and 49% were black, with balanced baseline characteristics between groups. Median time (95% confidence interval) to orientation was 8.5 (7-13) versus 42 (35 to NA [not applicable]) days for the early and standard appointment groups, respectively (P<0.001). Attendance rates at the orientation session were 77% (57/74) versus 59% (44/74) in the early and standard appointment groups, respectively, which demonstrates a significant 18% absolute and 56% relative improvement (relative risk, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.37; P=0.022). The number needed to treat was 5.7. There was no difference (P>0.05) in any of the secondary outcome measures, but statistical power for these end points was low.

BACKGROUND: Current pharmacological treatments to limit recurrent AF in patients with previous AF have limited efficacy and high rates of adverse events. Results of trials that tested the efficacy of n-3 PUFA provided heterogeneous results. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial involving 586 outpatient participants with confirmed symptomatic paroxysmal AF that required cardioversion (n = 428), at least 2 episodes of AF in the 6 months before randomization (n = 55), or both (103). Patients were randomly allocated to n-3 PUFA (1 g/day) or placebo for 12 months. The primary endpoint was symptomatic recurrence of AF. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between patients allocated to placebo and those who received n-3 PUFA for the main outcome. At 12 months, 56 of 297 participants (18.9%) in the placebo group and 69 of 289 participants (24.0%) in the n-3 PUFA group had a recurrent symptomatic AF (hazard ratio: 1.28, 95% confidence interval: 0.90 to 1.83, p = 0.17). There was no difference between treatment with placebo and n-3 PUFA for any of the other pre-specified endpoints, including the composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, heart failure development, or severe bleeding that occurred in 20 (6.7%) and 16 (5.5%) of patients randomized to placebo or n-3 PUFA, respectively (hazard ratio: 0.86, 95% confidence interval: 0.44 to 1.66, p = 0.65).

The goal of this study was to ascertain the prescription requirements and informal OTC availability of OCs worldwide. STUDY DESIGN: From April 2011 to September 2012, we researched official documentation and conducted an online survey with government officials and pharmaceutical and reproductive health specialists on OC availability in countries worldwide. Results were compiled in a database and entered into a map for analysis of regional patterns. RESULTS: Data were obtained for 147 countries. OCs were informally available without prescription in 38% of countries, legally available without prescription (no screening by a health professional required) in 24% of countries, legally available without prescription (screening required) in 8% of countries and available only by prescription in 31% of countries. Notable regional patterns in OC prescription requirements emerged. CONCLUSIONS: OCs are available without prescription in the majority of countries. Country experiences with OTC provision may provide evidence about the safety and effectiveness of OTC provision as a strategy to improve access to effective family planning.","*Contraceptives, Oral/adverse effects *Drug and Narcotic Control *Family Planning Policy Female Health Care Surveys Health Services Accessibility Humans Internet *Nonprescription Drugs/adverse effects *Prescription Drugs/adverse effects World Health"

Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy has been associated with congenital anomalies, neonatal withdrawal syndrome, and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. However, the risk of stillbirth and infant mortality when accounting for previous maternal psychiatric disease remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To study risk of stillbirth and infant mortality associated with use of SSRIs during pregnancy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study from all Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) at different periods from 1996 through 2007. The study included women with singleton births. We obtained information on maternal use of SSRIs from prescription registries. Maternal characteristics, pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes were obtained from patient and medical birth registries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We used logistic regression to estimate relative risks of stillbirth, neonatal death, and postneonatal death associated with SSRI use during pregnancy taking into account maternal characteristics and previous psychiatric hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 1,633,877 singleton births in the study, 6054 were stillbirths; 3609, neonatal deaths; and 1578, postneonatal deaths. A total of 29,228 (1.79%) of mothers had filled a prescription for an SSRI during pregnancy. Women exposed to an SSRI presented with higher rates of stillbirth (4.62 vs 3.69 per 1000, P = .01) and postneonatal death (1.38 vs 0.96 per 1000, P = .03) than those who did not. The rate of neonatal death was similar between groups (2.54 vs 2.21 per 1000, P = .24). Yet in multivariable models, SSRI use was not associated with stillbirth (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.17; 95% CI, 0.96-1.41; P = .12), neonatal death (adjusted OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.96-1.57; P = .11), or postneonatal death (adjusted OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.97-1.86; P = .08). Estimates were further attenuated when stratified by previous hospitalization for psychiatric disease. The adjusted OR for stillbirth in women with a previous hospitalization for psychiatric disease was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.66-1.28; P = .62) and was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.84-1.36; P = .59) for those who had not been previously hospitalized. The corresponding ORs for neonatal death were 0.89 (95% CI, 0.58-1.39; P = .62) for women who were hospitalized and 1.14 (95% CI, 0.84-1.56; P = .39) for women who were not. For postneonatal death, the ORs were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.61-1.69; P = .95) for women who were hospitalized and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.71-1.72; P = .66) for women who were not. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among women with singleton births in Nordic countries, no significant association was found between use of SSRIs during pregnancy and risk of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, or postneonatal mortality. However, decisions about use of SSRIs during pregnancy must take into account other perinatal outcomes and the risks associated with maternal mental illness.","Adult Cohort Studies Decision Making Female Humans Infant Infant Mortality Infant, Newborn Logistic Models Mental Disorders/*drug therapy Middle Aged Odds Ratio Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications/*drug therapy Pregnancy Outcome Risk Scandinavia/epidemiology Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use Stillbirth/*epidemiology Young Adult"
23277898,The association between health care quality and cost: a systematic review.,Ann Intern Med,Hussey PS and Wertheimer S and Mehrotra A,rand,"BACKGROUND: Although there is broad policy consensus that both cost containment and quality improvement are critical, the association between costs and quality is poorly understood. PURPOSE: To systematically review evidence of the association between health care quality and cost. DATA SOURCES: Electronic literature search of PubMed, EconLit, and EMBASE databases for U.S.-based studies published between 1990 and 2012. STUDY SELECTION: Title, abstract, and full-text review to identify relevant studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently abstracted data with differences reconciled by consensus. Studies were categorized by level of analysis, type of quality measure, type of cost measure, and method of addressing confounders. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 61 included studies, 21 (34%) reported a positive or mixed-positive association (higher cost associated with higher quality); 18 (30%) reported a negative or mixed-negative association; and 22 (36%) reported no difference, an imprecise or indeterminate association, or a mixed association. The associations were of low to moderate clinical significance in many studies. Of 9 studies using instrumental variables analysis to address confounding by unobserved patient health status, 7 (78%) reported a positive association, but other characteristics of these studies may have affected their findings. LIMITATIONS: Studies used widely heterogeneous methods and measures. The review is limited by the quality of underlying studies. CONCLUSION: Evidence of the direction of association between health care cost and quality is inconsistent. Most studies have found that the association between cost and quality is small to moderate, regardless of whether the direction is positive or negative. Future studies should focus on what types of spending are most effective in improving quality and what types of spending represent waste.

However, the rapidly changing food-marketing landscape requires research to measure the effects of nontraditional forms of marketing on the health-related behaviors of children. OBJECTIVES: The main aim of this study was to examine the effect of advergames that promote energy-dense snacks or fruit on children's ad libitum snack and fruit consumption and to examine whether this consumption differed according to brand and product type (energy-dense snacks and fruit). The second aim was to examine whether advergames can stimulate fruit intake. DESIGN: We used a randomized between-subject design with 270 children (age: 8-10 y) who played an advergame that promoted energy-dense snacks (n = 69), fruit (n = 67), or nonfood products (n = 65) or were in the control condition (n = 69). Subsequently, we measured the free intake of energy-dense snacks and fruit. The children then completed questionnaire measures, and we weighed and measured them. RESULTS: The main finding was that playing an advergame containing food cues increased general energy intake, regardless of the advertised brand or product type (energy-dense snacks or fruit), and this activity particularly increased the intake of energy-dense snack foods. Children who played the fruit version of the advergame did not eat significantly more fruit than did those in the other groups. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that playing advergames that promote food, including either energy-dense snacks or fruit, increases energy intake in children.",*Advertising as Topic Child *Child Behavior Cues *Energy Intake Female *Fruit/economics *Health Promotion Humans Male Netherlands Questionnaires *Snacks *Video Games/adverse effects
23284038,Electronic prompt to improve outpatient code status documentation for patients with advanced lung cancer.,J Clin Oncol,Temel JS and Greer JA and Gallagher ER and Jackson VA and Lennes IT and Muzikansky A and Park ER and Pirl WF,partners,"PURPOSE: Rates of documentation of end-of-life care preferences in the medical record remain low, even among patients with incurable malignancies. We therefore conducted a two-phase study to develop and assess the effect of electronic prompts to encourage oncology clinicians to document code status in the outpatient electronic health record (EHR) of patients with advanced lung cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To determine the optimal delivery, content, and timing of the electronic prompt, we first facilitated focus groups with oncology clinicians at an affiliated medical center. Given this feedback, we developed e-mail reminders timed to the start of each new chemotherapy regimen. Between July 2009 and January 2011, 102 eligible patients with incurable lung cancer were approached, and 100 agreed to participate. We compared e-mail prompt participants (EPPs) with a cohort of 100 consecutive historical controls who began therapy for incurable lung cancer at least 1 year before the start of this study. The primary outcome measure was clinician documentation of code status in the EHR. RESULTS: EPPs were similar to historical controls, with no significant differences in demographic or clinical characteristics. At 1-year follow-up, 33.7% (n = 33/98) of EPPs had a code status documented in the outpatient EHR compared with 14.5% (n = 12/83) of historical controls (P = .003). Mean time to code status documentation was significantly shorter in EPPs (8.6 months [95% CI, 7.6 to 9.5]) compared with controls (10.5 months [95% CI, 9.8 to 11.3]; P = .004). CONCLUSION: e-mail prompts may improve the rate and timing of code status documentation in the EHR and warrant further investigation.",Aged Clinical Coding/*statistics & numerical data Cohort Studies Documentation/methods/*statistics & numerical data Electronic Health Records/statistics & numerical data Electronic Mail Female Humans Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology Male Middle Aged Outpatients/*statistics & numerical data Reproducibility of Results Time Factors

The objective was to assess the risk of CVD according to PA levels in adults. METHODS: We included a total of 13 576 men and 19 416 women aged 29 to 69 years and participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort in Spain, recruited between 1992 and 1996 and followed-up until 2006 to ascertain incident CVD events. The validated European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition PA questionnaire was used to assess metabolic equivalent x hours per week dedicated to different types of PA. Hazard ratios of CVD by PA levels were estimated using multivariate Cox regression. Extensive baseline data collected on diet, lifestyle habits, medical history, and anthropometry were available to adjust for. RESULTS: A total of 210 transient ischemic attacks and 442 stroke cases (80% ischemic, 10% hemorrhagic, 7% subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 3% mixed or unspecified) were registered after 12.3 years of mean follow-up. Recreational activity was inversely associated with risk of CVD in women but not in men. Women walking for >/=3.5 hours per week were at lower risk of stroke than those who did not engage in regular walking. No significant associations were found for other leisure time activities or vigorous PA with CVD in either sex. CONCLUSIONS: Recreational PA of moderate intensity was inversely associated with stroke incidence in women, whereas PA showed no effect on CVD risk in men. Increasing time dedicated to activities such as walking would be expected to help to reduce the stroke burden in women.",Adult Aged Cerebrovascular Disorders/*epidemiology/physiopathology/prevention & control Cohort Studies Europe/epidemiology Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Middle Aged *Motor Activity/physiology Neoplasms/*epidemiology/physiopathology/prevention & control *Nutrition Surveys/methods Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Spain/epidemiology

MATERIALS AND METHODS: After merging the NIS (Nationwide Inpatient Sample) and the AHA (American Hospital Association) survey from 2006 to 2008, we identified 29,837 patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy. The primary outcome was treatment with radical prostatectomy at hospitals that have adopted robotic surgery. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify patient and hospital characteristics associated with radical prostatectomy performed at hospitals with robotic surgery. RESULTS: Overall 20,424 (68.5%) patients were surgically treated with radical prostatectomy at hospitals with robotic surgery, while 9,413 (31.5%) underwent radical prostatectomy at hospitals without robotic surgery. There was a marked increase in radical prostatectomy at hospital adopters from 55.8% in 2006 and 70.7% in 2007 to 76.1% in 2008 (p <0.001 for trend). After adjusting for patient and hospital features, lower odds of undergoing radical prostatectomy at hospitals with robotic surgery were seen in black patients (OR 0.81, p <0.001) and Hispanic patients (OR 0.77, p <0.001) vs white patients. Compared to having private health insurance, being primarily insured with Medicaid (OR 0.70, p <0.001) was also associated with lower odds of being treated at hospitals with robotic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was a rapid shift of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy to hospitals with robotic surgery from 2006 to 2008, black and Hispanic patients or those primarily insured by Medicaid were less likely to undergo radical prostatectomy at such hospitals.",Aged Health Services Accessibility/*statistics & numerical data Healthcare Disparities/*statistics & numerical data *Hospitals Humans Male Middle Aged Prostatectomy/*methods Prostatic Neoplasms/*surgery *Robotics

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the association between dietary fat intake and semen quality among 701 young Danish men from the general population. DESIGN: In this cross-sectional study, men were recruited when they were examined to determine their fitness for military service from 2008 to 2010. They delivered a semen sample, underwent a physical examination, and answered a questionnaire comprising a quantitative food-frequency questionnaire to assess food and nutrient intakes. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed with semen variables as outcomes and dietary fat intakes as exposure variables, adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: A lower sperm concentration and total sperm count in men with a high intake of saturated fat was found. A significant dose-response association was found, and men in the highest quartile of saturated fat intake had a 38% (95% CI: 0.1%, 61%) lower sperm concentration and a 41% (95% CI: 4%, 64%) lower total sperm count than did men in the lowest quartile. No association between semen quality and intake of other types of fat was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are of potentially great public interest, because changes in diet over the past decades may be part of the explanation for the recently reported high frequency of subnormal human sperm counts. A reduction in saturated fat intake may be beneficial for both general and reproductive health.","Adolescent Cross-Sectional Studies Denmark/epidemiology Diet, High-Fat/*adverse effects Humans Linear Models Male Mass Screening Oligospermia/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology Questionnaires Risk Factors Semen Analysis Severity of Illness Index"
23086897,Center competition and outcomes following liver transplantation.,Liver Transpl,Halldorson JB and Paarsch HJ and Dodge JL and Segre AM and Lai J and Roberts JP,Missing,"In the United States, livers for transplantation are distributed within donation service areas (DSAs). In DSAs with multiple transplant centers, competition among centers for organs and recipients may affect recipient selection and outcomes in comparison with DSAs with only 1 center. The objective of this study was to determine whether competition within a DSA is associated with posttransplant outcomes and variations in patients wait-listed within the DSA. United Network for Organ Sharing data for 38,385 adult cadaveric liver transplant recipients undergoing transplantation between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2009 were analyzed to assess differences in liver recipients and donors and in posttransplant survival by competition among centers. The main outcome measures that were studied were patient characteristics, actual and risk-adjusted graft and patient survival rates after transplantation, organ quality as quantified by the donor risk index (DRI), wait-listed patients per million population by DSA, and competition as quantified by the Hirschman-Herfindahl index (HHI). Centers were stratified by HHI levels as no competition or as low, medium (or mid), or high competition. In comparison with DSAs without competition, the low-, mid-, and high-competition DSAs (1) performed transplantation for patients with a higher risk of graft failure [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.24, HR = 1.26, and HR = 1.34 (P < 0.001 for each)] and a higher risk of death [HR = 1.21, HR = 1.23, and HR = 1.34 (P < 0.001 for each)] and for a higher proportion of sicker patients as quantified by the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score [10.0% versus 14.8%, 20.1%, and 28.2% with a match MELD score of 31-40 (P < 0.001 for each comparison)], (2) were more likely to use organs in the highest risk quartile as quantified by the DRI [18.3% versus 27.6%, 20.4%, and 31.7% (P </= 0.001 for each)], and (3) listed more patients per million population [18 (median) versus 34 (P = not significant), 37 (P = 0.005), and 45 (P = 0.0075)]. Significant variability in patient selection for transplantation is associated with market variables characterizing competition among centers.

This year's report includes incidence trends for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers and HPV vaccination (recommended for adolescents aged 11-12 years). METHODS: Data on cancer incidence were obtained from the CDC, NCI, and NAACCR, and data on mortality were obtained from the CDC. Long- (1975/1992-2009) and short-term (2000-2009) trends in age-standardized incidence and death rates for all cancers combined and for the leading cancers among men and among women were examined by joinpoint analysis. Prevalence of HPV vaccination coverage during 2008 and 2010 and of Papanicolaou (Pap) testing during 2010 were obtained from national surveys. RESULTS: Death rates continued to decline for all cancers combined for men and women of all major racial and ethnic groups and for most major cancer sites; rates for both sexes combined decreased by 1.5% per year from 2000 to 2009. Overall incidence rates decreased in men but stabilized in women. Incidence rates increased for two HPV-associated cancers (oropharynx, anus) and some cancers not associated with HPV (eg, liver, kidney, thyroid). Nationally, 32.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 30.3% to 33.6%) of girls aged 13 to 17 years in 2010 had received three doses of the HPV vaccine, and coverage was statistically significantly lower among the uninsured (14.1%, 95% CI = 9.4% to 20.6%) and in some Southern states (eg, 20.0% in Alabama [95% CI = 13.9% to 27.9%] and Mississippi [95% CI = 13.8% to 28.2%]), where cervical cancer rates were highest and recent Pap testing prevalence was the lowest. CONCLUSIONS: The overall trends in declining cancer death rates continue. However, increases in incidence rates for some HPV-associated cancers and low vaccination coverage among adolescents underscore the need for additional prevention efforts for HPV-associated cancers, including efforts to increase vaccination coverage.","Adolescent African Americans/statistics & numerical data Age Distribution *Alphapapillomavirus Anus Neoplasms/epidemiology/virology Asian Americans/statistics & numerical data Cause of Death *Cost of Illness Female Hispanic Americans/statistics & numerical data Humans Incidence Indians, North American/statistics & numerical data Male Mortality/trends Neoplasms/*epidemiology/ethnology/mortality/prevention & control/*virology Oceanic Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/epidemiology/virology Papanicolaou Test Papillomavirus Infections/complications/*epidemiology/ethnology Papillomavirus Vaccines/*administration & dosage Penile Neoplasms/epidemiology/virology SEER Program Sex Distribution United States/epidemiology Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology/virology Vaginal Neoplasms/epidemiology/virology Vaginal Smears/statistics & numerical data Vulvar Neoplasms/epidemiology/virology"

It is likely that a small molecule could be found with lithium-like efficacy but without toxicity through target-based drug discovery; however, therapeutic target of lithium remains equivocal. Inositol monophosphatase is a possible target but no bioavailable inhibitors exist. Here we report that the antioxidant ebselen inhibits inositol monophosphatase and induces lithium-like effects on mouse behaviour, which are reversed with inositol, consistent with a mechanism involving inhibition of inositol recycling. Ebselen is part of the National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection, a chemical library of bioavailable drugs considered clinically safe but without proven use. Therefore, ebselen represents a lithium mimetic with the potential both to validate inositol monophosphatase inhibition as a treatment for bipolar disorder and to serve as a treatment itself.","Animals Azoles/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use Behavior, Animal/drug effects Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology Blood-Brain Barrier/drug effects/enzymology/pathology Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use Humans Inositol/deficiency/pharmacology Lithium/pharmacology/*therapeutic use Male Mice Mice, Inbred C57BL *Molecular Mimicry Organoselenium Compounds/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism"
23303200,The cost of breast cancer screening in the Medicare population.,JAMA Intern Med,Gross CP and Long JB and Ross JS and Abu-Khalaf MM and Wang R and Killelea BK and Gold HT and Chagpar AB and Ma X,yale,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the cost to Medicare of breast cancer screening or whether regional-level screening expenditures are associated with cancer stage at diagnosis or treatment costs, particularly because newer breast cancer screening technologies, like digital mammography and computer-aided detection (CAD), have diffused into the care of older women. METHODS: Using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, we identified 137 274 women ages 66 to 100 years who had not had breast cancer and assessed the cost to fee-for-service Medicare of breast cancer screening and workup during 2006 to 2007. For women who developed cancer, we calculated initial treatment cost. We then assessed screening-related cost at the Hospital Referral Region (HRR) level and evaluated the association between regional expenditures and workup test utilization, cancer incidence, and treatment costs. RESULTS: In the United States, the annual costs to fee-for-service Medicare for breast cancer screening-related procedures (comprising screening plus workup) and treatment expenditures were $1.08 billion and $1.36 billion, respectively. For women 75 years or older, annual screening-related expenditures exceeded $410 million. Age-standardized screening-related cost per beneficiary varied more than 2-fold across regions (from $42 to $107 per beneficiary); digital screening mammography and CAD accounted for 65% of the difference in screening-related cost between HRRs in the highest and lowest quartiles of cost. Women residing in HRRs with high screening costs were more likely to be diagnosed as having early-stage cancer (incidence rate ratio, 1.78 [95% CI, 1.40-2.26]). There was no significant difference in the cost of initial cancer treatment per beneficiary between the highest and lowest screening cost HRRs ($151 vs $115; P = .20). CONCLUSIONS: The cost to Medicare of breast cancer screening exceeds $1 billion annually in the fee-for-service program. Regional variation is substantial and driven by the use of newer and more expensive technologies; it is unclear whether higher screening expenditures are achieving better breast cancer outcomes.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis/economics/epidemiology/therapy Fee-for-Service Plans/economics Female Humans Incidence Mass Screening/*economics Medicare/*economics United States/epidemiology"

Increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to cefixime have been identified worldwide and have been associated with reports of clinical failure. OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of clinical treatment failure of N. gonorrhoeae infections associated with the use of cefixime. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: A retrospective cohort study of culture-positive N. gonorrhoeae infections at a single sexual health clinic in Toronto, Canada, that routinely performs test of cure. The cohort comprised N. gonorrhoeae culture-positive individuals identified between May 1, 2010, and April 30, 2011, treated with cefixime as recommended by Public Health Agency of Canada guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cefixime treatment failure, defined as the repeat isolation of N. gonorrhoeae at the test-of-cure visit identical to the pretreatment isolate by molecular typing and explicit denial of reexposure. RESULTS: There were 291 N. gonorrhoeae culture-positive individuals identified. Of 133 who returned for test of cure, 13 were culture positive; 9 patients were determined to have experienced cefixime treatment failure, involving urethral (n = 4), pharyngeal (n = 2), and rectal (n = 3) sites. The overall rate of clinical treatment failure among those who had a test of cure was 6.77% (95% CI, 3.14%-12.45%; 9/133).

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the lifetime prevalence of suicidal behaviors among US adolescents and the associations of retrospectively reported, temporally primary DSM-IV disorders with the subsequent onset of suicidal behaviors. DESIGN: Dual-frame national sample of adolescents from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement. SETTING: Face-to-face household interviews with adolescents and questionnaires for parents. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6483 adolescents 13 to 18 years of age and their parents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime suicide ideation, plans, and attempts. RESULTS: The estimated lifetime prevalences of suicide ideation, plans, and attempts among the respondents are 12.1%, 4.0%, and 4.1%, respectively. The vast majority of adolescents with these behaviors meet lifetime criteria for at least one DSM-IV mental disorder assessed in the survey. Most temporally primary (based on retrospective age-of-onset reports) fear/anger, distress, disruptive behavior, and substance disorders significantly predict elevated odds of subsequent suicidal behaviors in bivariate models. The most consistently significant associations of these disorders are with suicide ideation, although a number of disorders are also predictors of plans and both planned and unplanned attempts among ideators. Most suicidal adolescents (>80%) receive some form of mental health treatment. In most cases (>55%), treatment starts prior to onset of suicidal behaviors but fails to prevent these behaviors from occurring. CONCLUSIONS: Suicidal behaviors are common among US adolescents, with rates that approach those of adults. The vast majority of youth with suicidal behaviors have preexisting mental disorders. The disorders most powerfully predicting ideation, though, are different from those most powerfully predicting conditional transitions from ideation to plans and attempts. These differences suggest that distinct prediction and prevention strategies are needed for ideation, plans among ideators, planned attempts, and unplanned attempts.","Adolescent Adolescent Behavior African Americans/psychology/statistics & numerical data Age of Onset Educational Status Ethnic Groups/psychology/statistics & numerical data European Continental Ancestry Group/psychology/statistics & numerical data Female Hispanic Americans/psychology/statistics & numerical data Humans Male Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/therapy Prevalence Sex Factors *Suicidal Ideation Suicide/*statistics & numerical data Suicide, Attempted/*statistics & numerical data United States/epidemiology"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed clinical trial participation patterns according to important SES (income, education) and demographic factors in a large sample of patients surveyed via an Internet-based treatment decision tool. Logistic regression, conditioning on type of cancer, was used. Attitudes toward clinical trials were assessed using prespecified items about treatment, treatment tolerability, convenience, and cost. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2011, 5,499 patients were successfully surveyed. Forty percent discussed clinical trials with their physician, 45% of discussions led to physician offers of clinical trial participation, and 51% of offers led to clinical trial participation. The overall clinical trial participation rate was 9%. In univariate models, older patients (P = .002) and patients with lower income (P = .001) and education (P = .02) were less likely to participate in clinical trials. In a multivariable model, income remained a statistically significant predictor of clinical trial participation (odds ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.94; P = .01). Even in patients age >/= 65 years, who have universal access to Medicare, lower income predicted lower trial participation. Cost concerns were much more evident among lower-income patients (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Lower-income patients were less likely to participate in clinical trials, even when considering age group. A better understanding of why income is a barrier may help identify ways to make clinical trials better available to all patients and would increase the generalizability of clinical trial results across all income levels.",Adult Age Factors Aged Breast Neoplasms/therapy *Clinical Trials as Topic Colorectal Neoplasms/therapy Decision Support Techniques Educational Status Female Humans *Income Logistic Models Lung Neoplasms/therapy Male Medicare Middle Aged Neoplasms/*therapy Odds Ratio *Patient Participation/psychology/statistics & numerical data *Patients Prostatic Neoplasms/therapy Questionnaires *Research Subjects/economics/psychology United States

In recent years, the traditional Pap smear has been replaced by a liquid-based method, which allows not only cytologic evaluation but also collection of DNA for detection of human papillomavirus, the causative agent of cervical cancer. We reasoned that this routinely collected DNA could be exploited to detect somatic mutations present in rare tumor cells that accumulate in the cervix once shed from endometrial or ovarian cancers. A panel of genes that are commonly mutated in endometrial and ovarian cancers was assembled with new whole-exome sequencing data from 22 endometrial cancers and previously published data on other tumor types. We used this panel to search for mutations in 24 endometrial and 22 ovarian cancers and identified mutations in all 46 samples. With a sensitive massively parallel sequencing method, we were able to identify the same mutations in the DNA from liquid Pap smear specimens in 100% of endometrial cancers (24 of 24) and in 41% of ovarian cancers (9 of 22). Prompted by these findings, we developed a sequence-based method to query mutations in 12 genes in a single liquid Pap smear specimen without previous knowledge of the tumor's genotype. When applied to 14 samples selected from the positive cases described above, the expected tumor-specific mutations were identified. These results demonstrate that DNA from most endometrial and a fraction of ovarian cancers can be detected in a standard liquid-based Pap smear specimen obtained during routine pelvic examination. Although improvements need to be made before applying this test in a routine clinical manner, it represents a promising step toward a broadly applicable screening methodology for the early detection of gynecologic malignancies.","DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/genetics Endometrial Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics Female Humans Mutation Ovarian Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics *Papanicolaou Test *Vaginal Smears"
22965893,Declining liver utilization for transplantation in the United States and the impact of donation after cardiac death.,Liver Transpl,Orman ES and Barritt AS 4th and Wheeler SB and Hayashi PH,unc,"Worsening donor liver quality resulting in decreased organ utilization may be contributing to the recent decline in liver transplants nationally. We sought to examine trends in donor liver utilization and the relationship between donor characteristics and nonuse. We used the United Network for Organ Sharing database to review all deceased adult organ donors in the United States from whom at least 1 solid organ was transplanted into a recipient. Trends in donor characteristics were examined. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between donor characteristics and liver nonuse between 2004 and 2010. Population attributable risk proportions were determined for donor factors associated with nonuse. We analyzed 107,259 organ donors. The number of unused livers decreased steadily from 1958 (66% of donors) in 1988 to 841 (15%) in 2004 but then gradually increased to 1345 (21%) in 2010. The donor age, the body mass index (BMI), and the prevalence of diabetes and donation after cardiac death (DCD) all increased over time, and all 4 factors were independently associated with liver nonuse. DCD had the highest adjusted odds ratio (OR) for nonuse, and the odds increased nearly 4-fold between 2004 [OR = 5.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.57-6.70] and 2010 (OR = 21.31, 95% CI = 18.30-24.81). The proportion of nonuse attributable to DCD increased from 9% in 2004 to 28% in 2010. In conclusion, the proportion of donor livers not used has increased since 2004. Older donor age, greater BMI, diabetes, and DCD are all independently associated with nonuse and are on the rise nationally. Current trends may lead to significant declines in liver transplant availability.",Adult Death Female Humans Liver Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data Male Middle Aged Tissue Donors *Tissue and Organ Procurement

The incidence of AMI has been shown to increase locally after natural disasters, but the effect of catastrophic events on AMI biorhythms is largely unknown. To assess the differences in the chronobiology of AMI in residents of New Orleans before and after Hurricane Katrina, the onset of AMI in patients at Tulane University Health Sciences Center in the 6 years before and the 3 years after Hurricane Katrina was retrospectively examined. Compared to the pre-Katrina group, the post-Katrina cohort demonstrated significant decreases in the onset of AMI during mornings (p = 0.002), Mondays (p <0.0001), and weekdays (p <0.0001) and significant increases in onset during weekends (p <0.0001) and nights (p <0.0001). These changes persisted during all 3 years after the storm. In conclusion, the normal pattern of AMI onset was altered after Hurricane Katrina, and expected morning, weekday, and Monday peaks were eliminated.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Chi-Square Distribution *Chronobiology Phenomena Coronary Angiography Cyclonic Storms Female Humans Incidence Life Change Events Male Middle Aged Myocardial Infarction/*epidemiology/psychology/radiography New Orleans/epidemiology Retrospective Studies Risk Factors"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): A nationally representative sample of females aged 15-44 years. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Infertility prevalence estimated by two approaches: [1] a constructed measure derived from questions on sexual activity, contraception, relationship status, and pregnancy, and [2] a measure based on estimated time to pregnancy derived from the respondents' current duration of pregnancy attempt (i.e., current duration approach). Associations with self-reported descriptive characteristics using weighted logistic regression or parametric survival models for each respective approach. RESULT(S): Infertility prevalence was approximately twofold higher using the current duration approach (15.5%; 95% confidence interval 8.6%-27.5%) vs. the constructed measure (7.0%; 95% confidence interval 6.2%-7.8%). Both methods identified similar patterns of increasing age, lower education, nulliparity, and history of gynecologic disorders as being associated with measures of impaired fecundity, whereas opposing patterns were seen for racial/ethnic identification and poverty status. CONCLUSION(S): Infertility prevalence based on a current duration approach was consistent with other US prospective cohort studies with preconception enrollment. These findings underscore the importance of definition and methodologic approach for estimating the prevalence of infertility.","Adolescent Adult Confidence Intervals Cross-Sectional Studies Female *Fertility Genital Diseases, Female/*epidemiology Humans Incidence Infertility, Female/*epidemiology Logistic Models Pregnancy Prevalence Risk Factors Socioeconomic Factors United States/epidemiology Young Adult"
23275382,The impact of a statewide pre-hospital STEMI strategy to bypass hospitals without percutaneous coronary intervention capability on treatment times.,Circulation,Fosbol EL and Granger CB and Jollis JG and Monk L and Lin L and Lytle BL and Xian Y and Garvey JL and Mears G and Corbett CC and Peterson ED and Glickman SW,duke,"BACKGROUND: The ultimate treatment goal for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is rapid reperfusion via primary percutaneous intervention (PCI). North Carolina has adopted a statewide STEMI referral strategy that advises paramedics to bypass local hospitals and transport STEMI patients directly to a PCI-capable hospital, even if a non-PCI-capable hospital is closer. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the adherence of emergency medical services to this STEMI protocol, as well as subsequent associations with patient treatment times and outcomes by linking data from the Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry((R))-Get With the Guidelines() and a statewide emergency medical services data system from June 2008 to September 2010 for all patients with STEMI. Patients were divided into those (1) transported directly to a PCI hospital, thereby bypassing a closer non-PCI hospital and (2) first taken to a closer non-PCI center and later transferred to a PCI hospital. Among 6010 patients with STEMI, 1288 were eligible and included in our study cohort. Of these, 826 (64%) were transported directly to a PCI facility, whereas 462 (36%) were first taken to a non-PCI hospital and later transferred. In a multivariable model, increase in differential driving time and cardiac arrest were associated with a lesser likelihood of being taken directly to a PCI center, whereas a history of PCI was associated with a higher likelihood of being taken directly to a PCI center. Patients sent directly to a PCI center were more likely to have times between first medical contact and PCI within guideline recommendations.

23318302,Mortality among homeless adults in Boston: shifts in causes of death over a 15-year period.,JAMA Intern Med,Baggett TP and Hwang SW and O'Connell JJ and Porneala BC and Stringfellow EJ and Orav EJ and Singer DE and Rigotti NA,partners,"BACKGROUND: Homeless persons experience excess mortality, but US-based studies on this topic are outdated or lack information about causes of death. To our knowledge, no studies have examined shifts in causes of death for this population over time. METHODS: We assessed all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates in a cohort of 28 033 adults 18 years or older who were seen at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2008. Deaths were identified through probabilistic linkage to the Massachusetts death occurrence files. We compared mortality rates in this cohort with rates in the 2003-2008 Massachusetts population and a 1988-1993 cohort of homeless adults in Boston using standardized rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: A total of 1302 deaths occurred during 90 450 person-years of observation. Drug overdose (n = 219), cancer (n = 206), and heart disease (n = 203) were the major causes of death. Drug overdose accounted for one-third of deaths among adults younger than 45 years. Opioids were implicated in 81% of overdose deaths. Mortality rates were higher among whites than nonwhites. Compared with Massachusetts adults, mortality disparities were most pronounced among younger individuals, with rates about 9-fold higher in 25- to 44-year-olds and 4.5-fold higher in 45- to 64-year-olds. In comparison with 1988-1993 rates, reductions in deaths from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were offset by 3- and 2-fold increases in deaths owing to drug overdose and psychoactive substance use disorders, resulting in no significant difference in overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The all-cause mortality rate among homeless adults in Boston remains high and unchanged since 1988 to 1993 despite a major interim expansion in clinical services. Drug overdose has replaced HIV as the emerging epidemic. Interventions to reduce mortality in this population should include behavioral health integration into primary medical care, public health initiatives to prevent and reverse drug overdose, and social policy measures to end homelessness.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Boston/epidemiology Cause of Death/*trends Drug Overdose/mortality Female Homeless Persons/*statistics & numerical data Humans Male Middle Aged Mortality/ethnology Retrospective Studies Sex Factors Young Adult"

Therefore, we evaluated the association between caffeine intake and urinary incontinence in United States men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were used from male NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys) 2005-2006 and 2007-2008 participants. Urinary incontinence was defined using a standard questionnaire with Incontinence Severity Index scores 3 or greater categorized as moderate to severe. Structured dietary recall was used to determine caffeine consumption (mg per day), water intake (gm per day) and total dietary moisture (gm per day). Stepwise multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between caffeine intake at or above the 75th and 90th percentiles and moderate to severe urinary incontinence, controlling for potential confounders, urinary incontinence risk factors and prostate conditions in men age 40 years or older. RESULTS: Of the 5,297 men 3,960 (75%) were 20 years old or older with complete data. Among these men the prevalence of any urinary incontinence was 12.9% and moderate to severe urinary incontinence was 4.4%. Mean caffeine intake was 169 mg per day. Caffeine intake at the upper 75th percentile (234 mg or more daily) and 90th percentile (392 mg or more per day) was significantly associated with having moderate to severe urinary incontinence (1.72, 95% 1.18-2.49 and 2.08, 95% 1.15-3.77, respectively). In addition, after adjusting for prostate conditions, the effect size for the association between caffeine intake and moderate to severe urinary incontinence remained. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine consumption equivalent to approximately 2 cups of coffee daily (250 mg) is significantly associated with moderate to severe urinary incontinence in United States men. Our findings support the further study of caffeine modification in men with urinary incontinence.","Adult Age Distribution Aged Aged, 80 and over Caffeine/*adverse effects Coffee/*adverse effects Databases, Factual Drinking Behavior Follow-Up Studies Humans Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis *Nutrition Surveys Prevalence Questionnaires Severity of Illness Index United States/epidemiology Urinary Incontinence/*epidemiology/*etiology"

We studied the effect of duodenal infusion of donor feces in patients with recurrent C. difficile infection. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients to receive one of three therapies: an initial vancomycin regimen (500 mg orally four times per day for 4 days), followed by bowel lavage and subsequent infusion of a solution of donor feces through a nasoduodenal tube; a standard vancomycin regimen (500 mg orally four times per day for 14 days); or a standard vancomycin regimen with bowel lavage. The primary end point was the resolution of diarrhea associated with C. difficile infection without relapse after 10 weeks. RESULTS: The study was stopped after an interim analysis. Of 16 patients in the infusion group, 13 (81%) had resolution of C. difficile-associated diarrhea after the first infusion. The 3 remaining patients received a second infusion with feces from a different donor, with resolution in 2 patients. Resolution of C. difficile infection occurred in 4 of 13 patients (31%) receiving vancomycin alone and in 3 of 13 patients (23%) receiving vancomycin with bowel lavage (P<0.001 for both comparisons with the infusion group). No significant differences in adverse events among the three study groups were observed except for mild diarrhea and abdominal cramping in the infusion group on the infusion day. After donor-feces infusion, patients showed increased fecal bacterial diversity, similar to that in healthy donors, with an increase in Bacteroidetes species and clostridium clusters IV and XIVa and a decrease in Proteobacteria species. CONCLUSIONS: The infusion of donor feces was significantly more effective for the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection than the use of vancomycin.

Successful management is difficult and complex. We sought to evaluate a tool to improve adherence to evidence-based best practices during such events. METHODS: Operating-room teams from three institutions (one academic medical center and two community hospitals) participated in a series of surgical-crisis scenarios in a simulated operating room. Each team was randomly assigned to manage half the scenarios with a set of crisis checklists and the remaining scenarios from memory alone. The primary outcome measure was failure to adhere to critical processes of care. Participants were also surveyed regarding their perceptions of the usefulness and clinical relevance of the checklists. RESULTS: A total of 17 operating-room teams participated in 106 simulated surgical-crisis scenarios. Failure to adhere to lifesaving processes of care was less common during simulations when checklists were available (6% of steps missed when checklists were available vs. 23% when they were unavailable, P<0.001). The results were similar in a multivariate model that accounted for clustering within teams, with adjustment for institution, scenario, and learning and fatigue effects (adjusted relative risk, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.42; P<0.001). Every team performed better when the crisis checklists were available than when they were not. A total of 97% of the participants reported that if one of these crises occurred while they were undergoing an operation, they would want the checklist used. CONCLUSIONS: In a high-fidelity simulation study, checklist use was associated with significant improvement in the management of operating-room crises. These findings suggest that checklists for use during operating-room crises have the potential to improve surgical care.

23739539,A comparison of actual versus predicted emergency ambulance journey times using generic Geographic Information System software.,Emerg Med J,McMeekin P and Gray J and Ford GA and Duckett J and Price CI,Missing,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The planning of regional emergency medical services is aided by accurate prediction of urgent ambulance journey times, but it is unclear whether it is appropriate to use Geographical Information System (GIS) products designed for general traffic. We examined the accuracy of a commercially available generic GIS package when predicting emergency ambulance journey times under different population and temporal conditions. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective cohort study of emergency ambulance admissions to three emergency departments (ED) serving differing population distributions in northeast England (urban/suburban/rural). The transport time from scene to ED for all the highest priority dispatches between 1 October 2009 and 30 September 2010 was compared with predictions made by generic GIS software. RESULTS: For 10 156 emergency ambulance journeys, the mean prediction discrepancy between actual and predicted journey times across all EDs was an underprediction of 1.6 min (SD 4.9). Underprediction was statistically significant at all population densities, but unlikely to be of clinical significance. Ambulances in urban areas were able to exceed general traffic speed, whereas, the opposite effect was seen in suburban and rural road networks. There were minor effects due to travel outside the busiest traffic times (mean overprediction 0.8 min) and during winter months (mean underprediction 0.4 min). CONCLUSIONS: It is reasonable to estimate emergency ambulance journey times using generic GIS software, but in order to avoid insufficient regional ambulance provision it would be necessary to make small adjustments because of the tendency towards systematic underprediction.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: To assess consumption patterns and individual-level associations. DESIGN: Trend and cross-sectional analyses of 24-hour dietary recall data and demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status (SES) drawn from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-2004, 2005-2006, and 2007-2008) data. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Children (aged 2 to 11 years, n=8,627), adolescents (aged 12 to 19 years, n=8,922), young adults (aged 20 to 34 years, n=5,933), and middle-aged and elder adults (aged >/=35 years, n=16,456). STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Age-stratified regression analyses for SSBs overall and by subtypes. RESULTS: The prevalence of heavy total SSB consumption (>/=500 kcal/day) increased among children (4% to 5%) although it decreased among adolescents (22% to 16%) and young adults (29% to 20%). Soda was the most heavily consumed SSB in all age groups except for children. Prevalence of soda consumption decreased, whereas heavy sports/energy drink consumption tripled (4% to 12%) among adolescents. Black children and adolescents showed higher odds of heavy fruit drink consumption (odds ratios 1.71 and 1.67) than whites. Low-income children had a higher odds of heavy total SSB consumption (odds ratio 1.93) and higher energy intake from total SSBs and fruit drinks (by 23 and 27 kcal/day) than high-income children. Adolescents with low- vs high-educated parents had higher odds of heavy total SSB consumption (odds ratio 1.28) and higher energy intake from total SSBs and soda (by 27 and 21 kcal/day). Low vs high SES was associated with a higher odds of heavy consumption of total SSBs, soda, and fruit drinks among adults. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of soda consumption fell, but consumption of nontraditional SSBs rose. Heterogeneity of heavy consumption by SSB types across racial/ethnic subpopulations and higher odds of heavy SSB consumption among low-SES populations should be considered in targeting policies to encourage healthful beverage consumption.","Adolescent Adult Beverages/*statistics & numerical data Carbonated Beverages/statistics & numerical data Child Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Dietary Sucrose/*administration & dosage *Energy Intake Female Humans Male Mental Recall Middle Aged *Nutrition Surveys Obesity/*epidemiology/etiology Socioeconomic Factors United States Young Adult"

23324839,Residential segregation and lung cancer mortality in the United States.,JAMA Surg,Hayanga AJ and Zeliadt SB and Backhus LM,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between race and lung cancer mortality and the effect of residential segregation in the United States. DESIGN: A retrospective, population-based study using data obtained from the 2009 Area Resource File and Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program. SETTING: Each county in the United States. PATIENTS: Black and white populations per US county. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A generalized linear model with a Poisson distribution and log link was used to examine the association between residential segregation and lung cancer mortality from 2003 to 2007 for black and white populations. Our primary independent variable was the racial index of dissimilarity. The index is a demographic measure that assesses the evenness with which whites and blacks are distributed across census tracts within each county. The score ranges from 0 to 100 in increasing degrees of residential segregation. RESULTS The overall lung cancer mortality rate was higher for blacks than whites (58.9% vs 52.4% per 100 000 population). Each additional level of segregation was associated with a 0.5% increase in lung cancer mortality for blacks (P < .001) and an associated decrease in mortality for whites (P = .002). Adjusted lung cancer mortality rates among blacks were 52.4% and 62.9% per 100 000 population in counties with the least (<40% segregation) and the highest levels of segregation (>/=60% segregation), respectively. In contrast, the adjusted lung cancer mortality rates for whites decreased with increasing levels of segregation.

23329309,Driving with central field loss I: effect of central scotomas on responses to hazards.,JAMA Ophthalmol,Bronstad PM and Bowers AR and Albu A and Goldstein R and Peli E,harvard,"OBJECTIVES: To determine how central field loss (CFL) affects reaction time to pedestrians and to test the hypothesis that scotomas lateral to the preferred retinal locus will delay detection of hazards approaching from that side. METHODS: Participants with binocular CFL (scotoma diameter, 7 degrees -25 degrees ; visual acuity, 0.3-1.0 logMAR) using lateral preferred retinal fixation loci and matched controls with normal vision drove in a simulator for approximately 1(1/2) hours per session for 2 sessions a week apart. Participants responded to frequent virtual pedestrians who appeared on either the left or right sides and approached the participant's lane on a collision trajectory that, therefore, caused them to remain in approximately the same area of the visual field. RESULTS: The study included 11 individuals with CFL and 11 controls with normal vision. The CFL participants had more detection failures for pedestrians who appeared in areas of visual field loss than did controls in corresponding areas (6.4% vs 0.2%). Furthermore, the CFL participants reacted more slowly to pedestrians in blind than nonscotomatous areas (4.28 vs 2.43 seconds, P < .001) and overall had more late and missed responses than controls (29% vs 3%, P < .001). Scotoma size and contrast sensitivity predicted outcomes in blind and seeing areas, respectively. Visual acuity was not correlated with response measures. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to causing visual acuity and contrast sensitivity loss, the central scotoma per se delayed hazard detection even though small eye movements could potentially compensate for the loss. Responses in nonscotomatous areas were also delayed, although to a lesser extent, possibly because of the eccentricity of fixation. Our findings will help practitioners advise patients with CFL about specific difficulties they may face when driving.","*Accidents, Traffic Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over *Automobile Driving Computer Simulation Contrast Sensitivity/physiology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Reaction Time/*physiology Scotoma/*physiopathology Vision, Binocular/physiology Vision, Low/*physiopathology Visual Acuity/physiology Visual Field Tests Visual Fields/*physiology Visual Perception"
23328914,Children with sensorineural hearing loss after passing the newborn hearing screen.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Dedhia K and Kitsko D and Sabo D and Chi DH,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To identify and describe the findings of children who passed their newborn hearing screen (NHS) and were subsequently found to have childhood hearing loss. SETTING: Academic tertiary care center. DESIGN: Retrospective medical chart review. METHODS: With approval of the institutional review board, hospital records were reviewed for children diagnosed as having hearing loss. We identified 923 children with hearing loss from 2001 to 2011. Patients who passed the NHS with subsequent hearing loss were included. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients were included in our study. The suspicion of hearing loss in patients who passed the NHS was most often from parental concerns (n = 28 [36%]) and failed school hearing screens (n = 25 [32%]). Speech and language delay and failed primary care physician screens accounted for 17% and 12%, respectively. Configuration of the audiogram was bilateral symmetric (n = 42 [54%]), bilateral asymmetric (n = 16 [21%]), and unilateral (n = 20 [26%]) loss. Thirty-seven patients (47%) had severe or profound hearing loss. The etiology was unknown in 42 patients (54%); the remaining was attributed to genetics (n = 13 [17%]), anatomic abnormality (n = 11 [14%]), acquired perinatal (n = 9 [12%]), and auditory neuropathy (n = 3 [4%]). CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study to characterize children with hearing loss who passed the NHS. In our review, parental concerns and school hearing screens were the most common method to diagnose hearing loss after passing the NHS. Families and primary care physicians may have a false sense of security when patients pass the NHS and overlook symptoms of hearing loss. This study raises the question whether further screens would identify hearing loss in children after passing the NHS.","Child Child, Preschool Female Hearing Loss, Bilateral/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology Hearing Loss, Sensorineural/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology Hearing Tests Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Language Development Disorders/epidemiology Male *Neonatal Screening Parents Pennsylvania/epidemiology Primary Health Care Retrospective Studies School Health Services Severity of Illness Index"
23339216,Hospital admissions for childhood asthma after smoke-free legislation in England.,Pediatrics,Millett C and Lee JT and Laverty AA and Glantz SA and Majeed A,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the implementation of English smoke-free legislation in July 2007 was associated with a reduction in hospital admissions for childhood asthma. METHODS: Interrupted time series study using Hospital Episodes Statistics data from April 2002 to November 2010. Sample consisted of all children (aged </=14 years) having an emergency hospital admission with a principle diagnosis of asthma. RESULTS: Before the implementation of the legislation, the admission rate for childhood asthma was increasing by 2.2% per year (adjusted rate ratio 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.03). After implementation of the legislation, there was a significant immediate change in the admission rate of -8.9% (adjusted rate ratio 0.91; 95% CI: 0.89-0.93) and change in time trend of -3.4% per year (adjusted rate ratio 0.97; 95% CI: 0.96-0.98). This change was equivalent to 6802 fewer hospital admissions in the first 3 years after implementation. There were similar reductions in asthma admission rates among children from different age, gender, and socioeconomic status groups and among those residing in urban and rural locations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm those from a small number of previous studies suggesting that the well-documented population health benefits of comprehensive smoke-free legislation appear to extend to reducing hospital admissions for childhood asthma.","Adolescent Asthma/*epidemiology/*prevention & control Child Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Emergency Service, Hospital/*utilization England Female Humans Male Patient Admission/*statistics & numerical data Smoke-Free Policy/*legislation & jurisprudence Tobacco Smoke Pollution/adverse effects/*legislation & jurisprudence/*prevention & control Utilization Review/statistics & numerical data"

Sample consisted of all children (aged </=14 years) having an emergency hospital admission with a principle diagnosis of asthma. RESULTS: Before the implementation of the legislation, the admission rate for childhood asthma was increasing by 2.2% per year (adjusted rate ratio 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.03). After implementation of the legislation, there was a significant immediate change in the admission rate of -8.9% (adjusted rate ratio 0.91; 95% CI: 0.89-0.93) and change in time trend of -3.4% per year (adjusted rate ratio 0.97; 95% CI: 0.96-0.98). This change was equivalent to 6802 fewer hospital admissions in the first 3 years after implementation. There were similar reductions in asthma admission rates among children from different age, gender, and socioeconomic status groups and among those residing in urban and rural locations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm those from a small number of previous studies suggesting that the well-documented population health benefits of comprehensive smoke-free legislation appear to extend to reducing hospital admissions for childhood asthma.","Adolescent Asthma/*epidemiology/*prevention & control Child Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Emergency Service, Hospital/*utilization England Female Humans Male Patient Admission/*statistics & numerical data Smoke-Free Policy/*legislation & jurisprudence Tobacco Smoke Pollution/adverse effects/*legislation & jurisprudence/*prevention & control Utilization Review/statistics & numerical data"

PURPOSE: To examine whether a single injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is more effective than placebo (saline) or glucocorticoid in reducing pain in adults with LE after 3 months. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: A total of 60 patients with chronic LE were randomized (1:1:1) to receive either a blinded injection of PRP, saline, or glucocorticoid. The primary end point was a change in pain using the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) questionnaire at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were ultrasonographic changes in tendon thickness and color Doppler activity. RESULTS: Pain reduction at 3 months (primary end point) was observed in all 3 groups, with no statistically significant difference between the groups; mean differences were the following: glucocorticoid versus saline: -3.8 (95% CI, -9.9 to 2.4); PRP versus saline: -2.7 (95% CI, -8.8 to 3.5); and glucocorticoid versus PRP: -1.1 (95% CI, -7.2 to 5.0). At 1 month, however, glucocorticoid reduced pain more effectively than did both saline and PRP; mean differences were the following: glucocorticoid versus saline: -8.1 (95% CI, -14.3 to -1.9); and glucocorticoid versus PRP: -9.3 (95% CI, -15.4 to -3.2). Among the secondary outcomes, at 3 months, glucocorticoid was more effective than PRP and saline in reducing color Doppler activity and tendon thickness. For color Doppler activity, mean differences were the following: glucocorticoid versus PRP: -2.6 (95% CI, -3.1 to -2.2); and glucocorticoid versus saline: -2.0 (95% CI, -2.5 to -1.6). For tendon thickness, mean differences were the following: glucocorticoid versus PRP: -0.5 (95% CI, -0.8 to -0.2); and glucocorticoid versus saline: -0.8 (95% CI, -1.2 to -0.5). CONCLUSION: Neither injection of PRP nor glucocorticoid was superior to saline with regard to pain reduction in LE at the primary end point at 3 months. However, injection of glucocorticoid had a short-term pain-reducing effect at 1 month in contrast to the other therapies. Injection of glucocorticoid in LE reduces both color Doppler activity and tendon thickness compared with PRP and saline.","Disability Evaluation Double-Blind Method Female Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use Humans Injections, Intra-Articular Male Middle Aged Pain Measurement *Platelet-Rich Plasma Tendons/ultrasonography Tennis Elbow/*therapy/ultrasonography Triamcinolone/*therapeutic use Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color"
23319626,Correlations between cannabis use and IQ change in the Dunedin cohort are consistent with confounding from socioeconomic status.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Rogeberg O,Missing,"Does cannabis use have substantial and permanent effects on neuropsychological functioning? Renewed and intense attention to the issue has followed recent research on the Dunedin cohort, which found a positive association between, on the one hand, adolescent-onset cannabis use and dependence and, on the other hand, a decline in IQ from childhood to adulthood [Meier et al. (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109(40):E2657-E2664]. The association is given a causal interpretation by the authors, but existing research suggests an alternative confounding model based on time-varying effects of socioeconomic status on IQ. A simulation of the confounding model reproduces the reported associations from the Dunedin cohort, suggesting that the causal effects estimated in Meier et al. are likely to be overestimates, and that the true effect could be zero. Further analyses of the Dunedin cohort are proposed to distinguish between the competing interpretations. Although it would be too strong to say that the results have been discredited, the methodology is flawed and the causal inference drawn from the results premature.","Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Female Humans *Intelligence Male Marijuana Abuse/*epidemiology/*psychology *Models, Biological Norway/epidemiology Socioeconomic Factors"
23337937,The association of aspirin use with age-related macular degeneration.,JAMA Intern Med,Liew G and Mitchell P and Wong TY and Rochtchina E and Wang JJ,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether regular aspirin use is associated with a higher risk for developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by using analyzed data from a 15-year prospective cohort. METHODS: A prospective analysis was conducted of data from an Australian population-based cohort with 4 examinations during a 15-year period (1992-1994 to 2007-2009). Participants completed a detailed questionnaire at baseline assessing aspirin use, cardiovascular disease status, and AMD risk factors. Age-related macular degeneration was graded side-by-side from retinal photographs taken at each study visit to assess the incidence of neovascular (wet) AMD and geographic atrophy (dry AMD) according to the international AMD classification. RESULTS: Of 2389 baseline participants with follow-up data available, 257 individuals (10.8%) were regular aspirin users and 63 of the 2389 developed neovascular AMD. Persons who were regular aspirin users were more likely to have incident neovascular AMD: the 15-year cumulative incidence was 9.3% in users and 3.7% in nonusers. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, history of cardiovascular disease, systolic blood pressure, and body mass index, persons who were regular aspirin users had a higher risk of developing neovascular AMD (odds ratio [OR], 2.46; 95% CI, 1.25-4.83). The association showed a dose-response effect (multivariate-adjusted P = .01 for trend). Aspirin use was not associated with the incidence of geographic atrophy (multivariate-adjusted OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.59-1.65). CONCLUSION: Regular aspirin use is associated with increased risk of incident neovascular AMD, independent of a history of cardiovascular disease and smoking.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Aspirin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Australia Cardiovascular Diseases/drug therapy/prevention & control Cohort Studies Female Humans Incidence Logistic Models Macular Degeneration/classification/epidemiology/*etiology Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies Risk Factors Smoking"
23315899,Association of tattooing and hepatitis C virus infection: a multicenter case-control study.,Hepatology,Carney K and Dhalla S and Aytaman A and Tenner CT and Francois F,Missing,"Although injection drug use (IDU) and blood transfusions prior to 1992 are well-accepted risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, many studies that evaluated tattooing as a risk factor for HCV infection did not control for a history of IDU or transfusion prior to 1992. In this large, multicenter, case-control study, we analyzed demographic and HCV risk factor exposure history data from 3,871 patients, including 1,930 with chronic HCV infection (HCV RNA-positive) and 1,941 HCV-negative (HCV antibody-negative) controls. Crude and fully adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of tattoo exposure by multivariate logistic regression in HCV-infected versus controls were determined. As expected, IDU (65.9% versus 17.8%; P < 0.001), blood transfusion prior to 1992 (22.3% versus 11.1%; P < 0.001), and history of having one or more tattoos (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 3.23-4.49; P < 0.001) were more common in HCV-infected patients than in control subjects. After excluding all patients with a history of ever injecting drugs and those who had a blood transfusion prior to 1992, a total of 1,886 subjects remained for analysis (465 HCV-positive patients and 1,421 controls). Among these individuals without traditional risk factors, HCV-positive patients remained significantly more likely to have a history of one or more tattoos after adjustment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity (OR, 5.17; 95% CI, 3.75-7.11; P < 0.001).

23341510,Associations of recreational physical activity and leisure time spent sitting with colorectal cancer survival.,J Clin Oncol,Campbell PT and Patel AV and Newton CC and Jacobs EJ and Gapstur SM,cancer,"PURPOSE: Little is known about the association of recreational physical activity or leisure time spent sitting with survival after colorectal cancer diagnosis. This study examined the associations of prediagnosis and postdiagnosis recreational physical activity and leisure time spent sitting with mortality among patients with colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a cohort of adults without colorectal cancer at baseline in 1992-1993, we identified 2,293 participants who were diagnosed with invasive, nonmetastatic colorectal cancer up to mid-2007. At baseline, before their cancer diagnosis, and again after their cancer diagnosis, participants completed detailed questionnaires that included information concerning recreational physical activity and leisure time spent sitting. RESULTS: During a maximum follow-up of 16.1 years after colorectal cancer diagnosis, 846 patients with colorectal cancer died, 379 of them from colorectal cancer. Engaging in 8.75 or more metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week of recreational physical activity (equivalent to approximately 150 minutes per week of walking) compared with fewer than 3.5 MET hours per week was associated with lower all-cause mortality (prediagnosis physical activity: relative risk [RR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.89; postdiagnosis physical activity: RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.71). Spending 6 or more hours per day of leisure time sitting compared with fewer than 3 hours per day was associated with higher all-cause mortality (prediagnosis sitting time: RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.68; postdiagnosis sitting time: RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.64). CONCLUSION: More recreational physical activity before and after colorectal cancer diagnosis was associated with lower mortality, whereas longer leisure time spent sitting was associated with higher risk of death.",Adult Aged Body Mass Index Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality Cohort Studies Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*mortality/pathology/therapy Diabetes Complications/mortality Educational Status Female Follow-Up Studies Food Habits Humans Hypertension/complications *Leisure Activities Male Meat Middle Aged *Motor Activity Multivariate Analysis Neoplasm Grading Odds Ratio Proportional Hazards Models Questionnaires Risk Risk Factors Smoking/adverse effects

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to investigate the association between midlife MedDiet adherence and cognitive performance assessed 13 y later among participants in the SU.VI.MAX (Supplementation with Vitamins and Mineral Antioxidants) study and to test the hypothesis of effect modification by occupation and education as cognitive reserve markers. DESIGN: A Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and a Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern Score (MSDPS) were estimated by using repeated 24-h dietary records (1994-1996) from 3083 middle-aged subjects. Cognitive performance was assessed in 2007-2009 by using 6 neuropsychological tests, and a composite score was built. Subgroup analyses were performed according to occupational and educational status. Mean differences and 95% CIs were estimated through covariance analyses. RESULTS: After potential confounders were accounted for, no association between MDS or MSDPS and cognitive scores was detected except for a lower phonemic fluency score with decreasing MSDPS (P = 0.048) and a lower backward digit span score with decreasing MDS (P = 0.03). In turn, a low MDS was related to a lower composite cognitive score in the small subsample of manual workers (n = 178, P-interaction = 0.04) who could be hypothesized to have low cognitive reserve. MedDiet adherence did not interact with educational level in relation to cognitive function. CONCLUSION: This study did not find support for a beneficial effect of MedDiet adherence on cognitive function, irrespective of educational level, which is the strongest indicator of cognitive reserve.","*Aging Biological Markers *Cognitive Reserve Diet/adverse effects Diet Records *Diet, Mediterranean Double-Blind Method Female Follow-Up Studies France/epidemiology Humans Incidence Longitudinal Studies Male Middle Aged Mild Cognitive Impairment/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control Patient Compliance"

OBJECTIVES: We estimate overall and age-specific prevalence of cross-reactive antibodies to H1N1pdm virus and rates of H1N1pdm infection during the first year of the pandemic using data from published and unpublished H1N1pdm seroepidemiological studies. METHODS: Primary aggregate H1N1pdm serologic data from each study were stratified in standardized age groups and evaluated based on when sera were collected in relation to national or subnational peak H1N1pdm activity. Seropositivity was assessed using well-described and standardized hemagglutination inhibition (HI titers >/= 32 or >/= 40) and microneutralization (MN >/= 40) laboratory assays. The prevalence of cross-reactive antibodies to the H1N1pdm virus was estimated for studies using sera collected prior to the start of the pandemic (between 2004 and April 2009); H1N1pdm cumulative incidence was estimated for studies in which collected both pre- and post-pandemic sera; and H1N1pdm seropositivity was calculated from studies with post-pandemic sera only (collected between December 2009-June 2010). RESULTS: Data from 27 published/unpublished studies from 19 countries/administrative regions - Australia, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Iran, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Reunion Island, Singapore, United Kingdom, United States, and Vietnam - were eligible for inclusion. The overall age-standardized pre-pandemic prevalence of cross-reactive antibodies was 5% (95%CI 3-7%) and varied significantly by age with the highest rates among persons >/= 65 years old (14% 95%CI 8-24%). Overall age-standardized H1N1pdm cumulative incidence was 24% (95%CI 20-27%) and varied significantly by age with the highest in children 5-19 (47% 95%CI 39-55%) and 0-4 years old (36% 95%CI 30-43%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results offer unique insight into the global impact of the H1N1 pandemic and highlight the need for standardization of seroepidemiological studies and for their inclusion in pre-pandemic preparedness plans. Our results taken together with recent global pandemic respiratory-associated mortality estimates suggest that the case fatality ratio of the pandemic virus was approximately 0.02%.","Age Factors Antibodies, Viral/*immunology Humans Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification Influenza, Human/*epidemiology/immunology Pandemics Seroepidemiologic Studies United States"

We aimed to assess any effects on site-specific cancer rates in the randomised trials of folic acid supplementation, at doses higher than those from fortification. METHODS: In these meta-analyses, we sought all trials completed before 2011 that compared folic acid versus placebo, had scheduled treatment duration at least 1 year, included at least 500 participants, and recorded data on cancer incidence. We obtained individual participant datasets that included 49,621 participants in all 13 such trials (ten trials of folic acid for prevention of cardiovascular disease [n=46,969] and three trials in patients with colorectal adenoma [n=2652]). All these trials were evenly randomised. The main outcome was incident cancer (ignoring non-melanoma skin cancer) during the scheduled treatment period (among participants who were still free of cancer). We compared those allocated folic acid with those allocated placebo, and used log-rank analyses to calculate the cancer incidence rate ratio (RR). FINDINGS: During a weighted average scheduled treatment duration of 5.2 years, allocation to folic acid quadrupled plasma concentrations of folic acid (57.3 nmol/L for the folic acid groups vs 13.5 nmol/L for the placebo groups), but had no significant effect on overall cancer incidence (1904 cancers in the folic acid groups vs 1809 cancers in the placebo groups, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.99-1.13, p=0.10). There was no trend towards greater effect with longer treatment. There was no significant heterogeneity between the results of the 13 individual trials (p=0.23), or between the two overall results in the cadiovascular prevention trials and the adenoma trials (p=0.13). Moreover, there was no significant effect of folic acid supplementation on the incidence of cancer of the large intestine, prostate, lung, breast, or any other specific site. INTERPRETATION: Folic acid supplementation does not substantially increase or decrease incidence of site-specific cancer during the first 5 years of treatment. Fortification of flour and other cereal products involves doses of folic acid that are, on average, an order of magnitude smaller than the doses used in these trials.

PURPOSE: This study examined whether commuting by car was associated with adults' weight gain over 4 years. METHODS: Among 822 adult residents of Adelaide, Australia, weight change was ascertained from self-reported weight at baseline (2003-2004) and at follow-up (2007-2008). Using time spent for car commuting and work status at baseline, participants were categorized as non-car commuters, occasional car commuters, and daily car commuters. Multilevel linear regression (conducted in 2012) examined associations of weight change with car-commuting category, adjusting for potential confounding variables, for the whole sample, and among those who were physically inactive or active (>/=150 minutes/week) in their leisure time. RESULTS: For the overall sample, adjusted mean weight gain (95% CI) over 4 years was 1.26 (0.64, 1.89) kg for non-car commuters; 1.53 (0.69, 2.37) kg for occasional car commuters; and 2.18 (1.44, 2.92) kg for daily car commuters (p for trend=0.090). Stratified analyses found a stronger association for those with sufficient leisure-time physical activity. For non-car commuters with sufficient leisure-time physical activity, the adjusted mean weight gain was 0.46 (-0.43, 1.35) kg, which was not significantly greater than 0. CONCLUSIONS: Over 4 years, those who used cars daily for commuting tended to gain more weight than those who did not commute by car. This relationship was pronounced among those who were physically active during leisure time.

23349357,Lightning and its association with the frequency of headache in migraineurs: an observational cohort study.,Cephalalgia,Martin GV and Houle T and Nicholson R and Peterlin A and Martin VT,Missing,"AIM: The aim of this article is to determine if lightning is associated with the frequency of headache in migraineurs. METHODS: Participants fulfilling diagnostic criteria for International Headache Society-defined migraine were recruited from sites located in Ohio ( N = 23) and Missouri ( N = 67). They recorded headache activity in a daily diary for three to six months. A generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression determined the odds ratio (OR) of headache on lightning days compared to non-lightning days. Other weather factors associated with thunderstorms were also added as covariates to the GEE model to see how they would attenuate the effect of lightning on headache. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 44 and 91% were female. The OR for headache was 1.31 (95% confidence limits (CL); 1.07, 1.66) during lighting days as compared to non-lightning days. The addition of thunderstorm-associated weather variables as covariates were only able to reduce the OR for headache on lightning days to 1.18 (95% CL; 1.02, 1.37). The probability of having a headache on lightning days was also further increased when the average current of lightning strikes for the day was more negative. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that lightning represents a trigger for headache in migraineurs that cannot be completely explained by other meteorological factors. It is unknown if lightning directly triggers headaches through electromagnetic waves or indirectly through production of bioaerosols (e.g. ozone), induction of fungal spores or other mechanisms. These results should be interpreted cautiously until replicated in a second dataset.",Adult Cohort Studies Female Humans *Lightning Male Migraine Disorders/*epidemiology/*etiology

STUDY DESIGN: Fifty children aged 5 months or younger with positional head deformity were included in this prospective clinical trial (n=20 plagiocephaly, n=10 brachycephaly, n=20 combination). A random distribution was performed for treatment with the bedding pillow alone (n=25) or with stretching exercises (n=25) for 6 weeks. Anthropometric caliper measurements were done before and after that interval. Cranial vault asymmetry index (CVAI) and cranial index (CI) were calculated and analyzed using a descriptive statistical general linear model. RESULTS: DeltaCVAI in the stretching group was 2.09% for plagiocephaly and 2.34% for combined head deformities. Using the bedding pillow, DeltaCVAI was 3.01% in plagiocephal children and 2.86% for combined head deformity. The DeltaCI in the stretching group was 0.94% for isolated brachycephal children and 2.24% for combined head deformity. DeltaCI in the pillow group was 3.63% for brachycephaly and 3.23% in children with combined head deformities, respectively.

We set out to determine the diagnostic accuracy of clinical judgment based on signs and symptoms to detect radiographic pneumonia in patients presenting with acute cough in primary care. In 2810 European patients with acute cough, general practitioners (GPs) recorded whether they considered pneumonia to be present (""yes"" or ""no"") immediately after history and physical examination. Chest radiography was performed within 1 week by local radiologists blind to other patient characteristics. 140 patients had radiographic pneumonia (5%), of whom 41 (29%) had been diagnosed as such. 31 (1%) patients had a clinical diagnosis that was not confirmed by radiography (n=2670). In clinically suspected pneumonia, 57% of subjects were subsequently diagnosed with radiographic pneumonia. Negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity and specificity of GPs' clinical judgment were 96%, 29% and 99%, respectively. Compared to patients with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, less severe symptoms were found in radiographic pneumonia cases not suspected clinically (p<0.05). The predictive values of GPs' clinical judgment, particularly the high NPVs, are helpful in routine care. Nonetheless, the majority of diagnoses of radiographic pneumonias was not suspected on clinical grounds. There is a need to further support the detection of clinically relevant pneumonia in primary care.","Adult Aged Cough/*diagnosis/*radiography Female General Practitioners Humans Judgment Male Middle Aged Physical Examination/methods Pneumonia/*diagnosis/*radiography Predictive Value of Tests Primary Health Care/methods Radiography, Thoracic/*methods Reproducibility of Results Sensitivity and Specificity"

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, Scotland, UK. POPULATION: All women with first deliveries recorded in the Aberdeen Maternity and Neonatal Databank (AMND) between 1986 and 2005. METHODS: All women identified from the AMND were classified into exposed and unexposed cohorts, according to whether or not they had PPH in their first delivery. They were then linked to any records of a second pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Any second pregnancy, time to second pregnancy, early or late pregnancy loss, and prevalence of PPH in the second pregnancy. RESULTS: Out of 34 334 women, 10% had a PPH in their first pregnancy. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to a second pregnancy, nor in the outcome of that second pregnancy, between women who had experienced a PPH in their first pregnancy and women who had not. For women with a caesarean delivery, there was a significant reduction in the proportion conceiving again, comparing the exposed and unexposed cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: From this cohort study we can conclude that if a PPH occurs in a first pregnancy, there is no delay in achieving a second pregnancy, and no detrimental effect on the outcome of that pregnancy.

Here we report that the CC genotype is found in 69% of Chinese patients with severe pandemic influenza A H1N1/09 virus infection compared with 25% in those with mild infection. Specifically, the CC genotype was estimated to confer a sixfold greater risk for severe infection than the CT and TT genotypes. More importantly, because the risk genotype occurs with such a high frequency, its effect translates to a large population-attributable risk of 54.3% for severe infection in the Chinese population studied compared with 5.4% in Northern Europeans. Interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 genetic variants could, therefore, have a strong effect of the epidemiology of influenza in China and in people of Chinese descent.","Adult Alleles Antibodies, Viral/blood Asian Continental Ancestry Group/*genetics Chemokine CCL2/blood China Female Gene Frequency/genetics Genes, Recessive/genetics *Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/physiology Influenza, Human/blood/*genetics/immunology/*virology Male Membrane Proteins/*genetics Models, Genetic Odds Ratio Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics Severity of Illness Index Young Adult"
23362014,Comparison of age at natural menopause in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with a non-clinic-based sample of women in northern California.,Cancer,Lin WT and Beattie M and Chen LM and Oktay K and Crawford SL and Gold EB and Cedars M and Rosen M,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) are related to an increased lifetime risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Although risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy reduces the risk of both cancers, loss of fertility is a major concern. A recent study suggested an association between BRCA1 mutation and occult primary ovarian insufficiency. The objective of the current study was to determine whether BRCA1/2 mutation carriers have an earlier onset of natural menopause compared with unaffected women. METHODS: White carriers of the BRCA1/2 gene (n = 382) were identified within the Breast Cancer Risk Program Registry at the University of California at San Francisco and compared with non-clinic-based white women in northern California (n = 765). The 2 groups were compared with regard to median age at the time of natural menopause before and after adjustment for known risk factors, and the role of smoking within each group was examined using the Kaplan-Meier approach for unadjusted analyses and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses for adjusted analyses. RESULTS: The median age at the time of natural menopause in the BRCA1/2 carriers was significantly younger than among the unaffected sample (50 years vs 53 years; P < .001). The unadjusted hazard ratio for natural menopause when comparing BRCA1/2 carriers with unaffected women was 4.06 (95% confidence interval, 3.03-5.45) and was 3.98 (95% confidence interval, 2.87-5.53) after adjusting for smoking, parity, and oral contraceptive use. For BRCA1/2 carriers who were current heavy smokers (smoking >/= 20 cigarettes/day), the median age at natural menopause was 46 years versus 49 years for nonsmokers (P = .027). CONCLUSIONS: The BRCA1/2 mutation was associated with a significantly earlier age at natural menopause, and heavy smoking compounded this risk. Because the relationship between menopause and the end of natural fertility is considered to be fixed, these findings suggest the risk of earlier infertility among BRCA1/2 carriers.","*Age Factors California Case-Control Studies Female *Genes, BRCA1 *Genes, BRCA2 *Heterozygote Detection Humans *Menopause Middle Aged *Mutation"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 2-year, prospective, randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled study was carried out in pregnant outpatients with a parent with type 2 diabetes who were treated from the end of the first trimester with 2 g myo-inositol plus 200 microg folic acid twice a day (n = 110) and in the placebo group (n = 110), who were only treated with 200 microg folic acid twice a day. The main outcome measure was the incidence of GDM in both groups. Secondary outcome measures were as follows: the incidence of fetal macrosomia (>4,000 g), gestational hypertension, preterm delivery, caesarean section, shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and neonatal distress respiratory syndrome. GDM diagnosis was performed according to the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) recommendations. RESULTS: Incidence of GDM was significantly reduced in the myo-inositol group compared with the placebo group: 6 vs. 15.3%, respectively (P = 0.04). In the myo-inositol group, a reduction of GDM risk occurrence was highlighted (odds ratio 0.35). A statistically significant reduction of fetal macrosomia in the myo-inositol group was also highlighted together with a significant reduction in mean fetal weight at delivery. In the other secondary outcome measures, there were no differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS: myo-Inositol supplementation in pregnant women with a family history of type 2 diabetes may reduce GDM incidence and the delivery of macrosomia fetuses.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy Diabetes, Gestational/*drug therapy Female Humans Inositol/*therapeutic use Pregnancy Prospective Studies"
23359049,Survival after lumpectomy and mastectomy for early stage invasive breast cancer: the effect of age and hormone receptor status.,Cancer,Hwang ES and Lichtensztajn DY and Gomez SL and Fowble B and Clarke CA,duke,"BACKGROUND: Randomized clinical trials (RCT) have demonstrated equivalent survival for breast-conserving therapy with radiation (BCT) and mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer. A large, population-based series of women who underwent BCT or mastectomy was studied to observe whether outcomes of RCT were achieved in the general population, and whether survival differed by surgery type when stratified by age and hormone receptor (HR) status. METHODS: Information was obtained regarding all women diagnosed in the state of California with stage I or II breast cancer between 1990 and 2004, who were treated with either BCT or mastectomy and followed for vital status through December 2009. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compare overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) between BCT and mastectomy groups. Analyses were stratified by age group (< 50 years and >/= 50 years) and tumor HR status. RESULTS: A total of 112,154 women fulfilled eligibility criteria. Women undergoing BCT had improved OS and DSS compared with women with mastectomy (adjusted hazard ratio for OS entire cohort = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80-0.83). The DSS benefit with BCT compared with mastectomy was greater among women age >/= 50 with HR-positive disease (hazard ratio = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.82-0.91) than among women age < 50 with HR-negative disease (hazard ratio = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.79-0.98); however, this trend was seen among all subgroups analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with early stage breast cancer, BCT was associated with improved DSS. These data provide confidence that BCT remains an effective alternative to mastectomy for early stage disease regardless of age or HR status.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antigens, CD4/metabolism Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/*mortality/pathology/radiotherapy/surgery Combined Modality Therapy Female Humans Mastectomy/*mortality Mastectomy, Segmental/*mortality Middle Aged"
23364007,Risk of hospitalization or death from ischemic heart disease among British vegetarians and nonvegetarians: results from the EPIC-Oxford cohort study.,Am J Clin Nutr,Crowe FL and Appleby PN and Travis RC and Key TJ,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Few previous prospective studies have examined differences in incident ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk between vegetarians and nonvegetarians. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the association of a vegetarian diet with risk of incident (nonfatal and fatal) IHD. DESIGN: A total of 44,561 men and women living in England and Scotland who were enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Oxford study, of whom 34% consumed a vegetarian diet at baseline, were part of the analysis. Incident cases of IHD were identified through linkage with hospital records and death certificates. Serum lipids and blood pressure measurements were available for 1519 non cases, who were matched to IHD cases by sex and age. IHD risk by vegetarian status was estimated by using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: After an average follow-up of 11.6 y, there were 1235 IHD cases (1066 hospital admissions and 169 deaths). Compared with nonvegetarians, vegetarians had a lower mean BMI [in kg/m(2); -1.2 (95% CI: -1.3, -1.1)], non-HDL-cholesterol concentration [-0.45 (95% CI: -0.60, -0.30) mmol/L], and systolic blood pressure [-3.3 (95% CI: -5.9, -0.7) mm Hg]. Vegetarians had a 32% lower risk (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.81) of IHD than did nonvegetarians, which was only slightly attenuated after adjustment for BMI and did not differ materially by sex, age, BMI, smoking, or the presence of IHD risk factors. CONCLUSION: Consuming a vegetarian diet was associated with lower IHD risk, a finding that is probably mediated by differences in non-HDL cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure.","Adult Blood Pressure Body Mass Index Choice Behavior Cholesterol, LDL/blood Cohort Studies *Diet, Vegetarian England/epidemiology *European Continental Ancestry Group Female Follow-Up Studies *Food Habits Food Preferences Hospitalization Humans Incidence Life Style Male Middle Aged Myocardial Ischemia/*epidemiology Neoplasms/epidemiology Nutritional Status Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Scotland/epidemiology Smoking/adverse effects"
23352752,The effect of an ambulance diversion ban on emergency department length of stay and ambulance turnaround time.,Ann Emerg Med,Burke LG and Joyce N and Baker WE and Biddinger PD and Dyer KS and Friedman FD and Imperato J and King A and Maciejko TM and Pearlmutter MD and Sayah A and Zane RD and Epstein SK,harvard,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Massachusetts became the first state in the nation to ban ambulance diversion in 2009. It was feared that the diversion ban would lead to increased emergency department (ED) crowding and ambulance turnaround time. We seek to characterize the effect of a statewide ambulance diversion ban on ED length of stay and ambulance turnaround time at Boston-area EDs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, pre-post observational analysis of 9 Boston-area hospital EDs before and after the ban. We used ED length of stay as a proxy for ED crowding. We compared hospitals individually and in aggregate to determine any changes in ED length of stay for admitted and discharged patients, ED volume, and turnaround time. RESULTS: No ED experienced an increase in ED length of stay for admitted or discharged patients or ambulance turnaround time despite an increase in volume for several EDs. There was an overall 3.6% increase in ED volume in our sample, a 10.4-minute decrease in length of stay for admitted patients, and a 2.2-minute decrease in turnaround time. When we compared high- and low-diverting EDs separately, neither saw an increase in length of stay, and both saw a decrease in turnaround time. CONCLUSION: After the first statewide ambulance diversion ban, there was no increase in ED length of stay or ambulance turnaround time at 9 Boston-area EDs. Several hospitals actually experienced improvements in these outcome measures. Our results suggest that the ban did not worsen ED crowding or ambulance availability at Boston-area hospitals.","Ambulances/organization & administration/*statistics & numerical data Boston Crowding Emergency Service, Hospital/organization & administration/*statistics & numerical data Health Policy Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data Humans Length of Stay/*statistics & numerical data Patient Discharge/statistics & numerical data Patient Transfer/organization & administration Retrospective Studies Time Factors"
23340895,Randomized crossover study to examine the necessity of an injection-to-meal interval in patients with type 2 diabetes and human insulin.,Diabetes Care,Muller N and Frank T and Kloos C and Lehmann T and Wolf G and Muller UA,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with diabetes and insulin therapy with human insulin were usually instructed to use an interval of 20-30 min between the injection and meal. We examined the necessity of the injection-to-meal interval (IMI) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and flexible insulin therapy with human insulin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized, open crossover trial, 100 patients with T2DM (47% men, mean age = 66.7 years) were randomized to the IMI first group (phase 1, IMI 20 min; phase 2, no IMI) or IMI last group (phase 1, no IMI; phase 2, IMI 20 min). The main outcome measures were HbA1c, blood glucose profile, incidence of hypoglycemia, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and patient preference. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were randomized to the IMI first group and 51 patients to the IMI last group. Omitting the IMI only slightly increases HbA1c (average intraindividual difference = 0.08% [95% CI 0.01-0.15]). Since the difference is not clinically relevant, a therapy without IMI is noninferior to its application (P < 0.001). In the secondary outcomes, the incidence of mild hypoglycemia also did not differ between no IMI and IMI significantly (mean of differences = -0.10, P = 0.493). No difference in the blood glucose profile of both groups was found. Treatment satisfaction increased markedly, by 8.08, if IMI was omitted (P < 0.001). The total score of the quality of life measure did not show differences between applying an IMI or not. Insulin therapy without IMI was preferred by 86.5% of patients (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An IMI for patients with T2DM and preprandial insulin therapy is not necessary.","Aged Blood Glucose/drug effects Cross-Over Studies Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy Female Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated/metabolism Humans Hypoglycemia/chemically induced Hypoglycemic Agents/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Insulin/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Male Middle Aged Postprandial Period"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Diabetes cases were obtained through a retrospective population-based registry. Hospital inpatient and outpatient records were reviewed for cases of type 1 and type 2 diabetes diagnosed from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004. The secondary source of validation was the School District of Philadelphia. Time series analysis was used to evaluate the changing pattern of incidence over the 20-year period. RESULTS: The overall age-adjusted incidence rate in 2000-2004 of 17.0 per 100,000 per year was significantly higher than that of previous cohorts, with an average yearly increase of 1.5% and an average 5-year cohort increase of 7.8% (P = 0.025). The incidence in white children (19.2 per 100,000 per year) was 48% higher than in the previous cohort. Children aged 0-4 years had a 70% higher incidence (12.2 per 100,000 per year) than the original cohort; this increase was most marked in young black children. The overall age-adjusted incidence of type 2 diabetes was 5.8 per 100,000 per year and was significantly higher in black children. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of type 1 diabetes is rising among children in Philadelphia. The incidence rate has increased by 29% since the 1985-1989 cohort. The most marked increases were among white children ages 10-14 years and black children ages 0-4 years. The incidence of type 1 diabetes is 18 times higher than that of type 2 in white children but only 1.6 times higher in black children.","Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*epidemiology Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology Female Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Male Philadelphia/epidemiology"
23440843,Selenium supplementation for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Rees K and Hartley L and Day C and Flowers N and Clarke A and Stranges S,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Selenium is a key component of a number of selenoproteins which protect against oxidative stress and have the potential to prevent chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, observational studies have shown inconsistent associations between selenium intake and CVD risk; in addition, there is concern around a possible increased risk of type 2 diabetes with high selenium exposure. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of selenium only supplementation for the primary prevention of CVD and examine the potential adverse effect of type 2 diabetes. SEARCH METHODS: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 10 of 12, October 2012) on The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to week 2 October 2012); EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to 2012 Week 42); CINAHL (EBSCO) (to 24 October 2012); ISI Web of Science (1970 to 24 October 2012); PsycINFO (Ovid) (1806 to week 3 October 2012); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database and Health Economics Evaluations Database (Issue 4 of 4, October 2012) on The Cochrane Library. Trial registers and reference lists of reviews and articles were searched and experts in the field were approached. No language restrictions were applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials on the effects of selenium only supplementation on major CVD end-points, mortality, changes in CVD risk factors, and type 2 diabetes were included both in adults of all ages from the general population and in those at high risk of CVD. Trials were only considered where the comparison group was placebo or no intervention. Only studies with at least three months follow-up were included in the meta-analyses, shorter term studies were dealt with descriptively. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: Twelve trials (seven with duration of at least three months) met the inclusion criteria, with 19,715 participants randomised. The two largest trials that were conducted in the USA (SELECT and NPC) reported clinical events. There were no statistically significant effects of selenium supplementation on all cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.08), CVD mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.2), non-fatal CVD events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) or all CVD events (fatal and non-fatal) (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11). There was a small increased risk of type 2 diabetes with selenium supplementation but this did not reach statistical significance (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.15). Other adverse effects that increased with selenium supplementation, as reported in the SELECT trial, included alopecia (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.62) and dermatitis grade 1 to 2 (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.35). Selenium supplementation reduced total cholesterol but this did not reach statistical significance (WMD - 0.11 mmol/L, 95% CI - 0.3 to 0.07). Mean high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were unchanged. There was a statistically significant reduction in non-HDL cholesterol (WMD - 0.2 mmol/L, 95% CI - 0.41 to 0.00) in one trial of varying selenium dosage. None of the longer term trials examined effects on blood pressure. Overall, the included studies were regarded as at low risk of bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The limited trial evidence that is available to date does not support the use of selenium supplements in the primary prevention of CVD.","Adult Antioxidants/*administration & dosage Cardiovascular Diseases/*prevention & control Cholesterol/blood *Dietary Supplements Food, Fortified Humans Primary Prevention/methods Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Selenium/*administration & dosage"
23375933,Treatment differences by health insurance among outpatients with coronary artery disease: insights from the national cardiovascular data registry.,J Am Coll Cardiol,Smolderen KG and Spertus JA and Tang F and Oetgen W and Borden WB and Ting HH and Chan PS,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: This study examined the association between insurance status and physicians' adherence with providing evidence-based treatments for coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: Within the PINNACLE (Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence) registry of the NCDR (National Cardiovascular Data Registry), the authors identified 60,814 outpatients with CAD from 30 U.S. practices. Hierarchical modified Poisson regression models with practice site as a random effect were used to study the association between health insurance (no insurance, public, or private health insurance) and 5 CAD quality measures. RESULTS: Of 60,814 patients, 5716 patients (9.4%) were uninsured and 11,962 patients (19.7%) had public insurance, whereas 43,136 (70.9%) were privately insured. After accounting for exclusions, uninsured patients with CAD were 9%, 12%, and 6% less likely to receive treatment with a beta-blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ACE-I/ARB), and lipid-lowering therapy, respectively, than privately insured patients, and patients with public insurance were 9% less likely to be prescribed ACE-I/ARB therapy. Most differences by insurance status were attenuated after adjusting for the site providing care. For example, whereas uninsured patients with left ventricular dysfunction and CAD were less likely to receive ACE-I/ARB therapy (unadjusted RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.84 to 0.93), this difference was eliminated after adjustment for site (adjusted RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.03; p = 0.18). CONCLUSIONS: Within this national outpatient cardiac registry, uninsured patients were less likely to receive evidence-based medications for CAD. These disparities were explained by the site providing care. Efforts to reduce treatment differences by insurance status among cardiac outpatients may additionally need to focus on improving the rates of evidence-based treatment at sites with high proportions of uninsured patients.","Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/therapeutic use Ambulatory Care Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists/therapeutic use Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use Coronary Artery Disease/*drug therapy/epidemiology Drug Utilization/statistics & numerical data Female Humans Hypolipidemic Agents/therapeutic use Insurance, Health/*statistics & numerical data Male Medicaid/statistics & numerical data Medically Uninsured/*statistics & numerical data Medicare/statistics & numerical data Middle Aged Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/therapeutic use Registries United States/epidemiology United States Department of Veterans Affairs United States Indian Health Service"

A new vaccine, modified Vaccinia Ankara virus expressing antigen 85A (MVA85A), was designed to enhance the protective efficacy of BCG. We aimed to assess safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of MVA85A against tuberculosis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in infants. METHODS: In our double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial, we enrolled healthy infants (aged 4-6 months) without HIV infection who had previously received BCG vaccination. We randomly allocated infants (1:1), according to an independently generated sequence with block sizes of four, to receive one intradermal dose of MVA85A or an equal volume of Candida skin test antigen as placebo at a clinical facility in a rural region near Cape Town, South Africa. We actively followed up infants every 3 months for up to 37 months. The primary study outcome was safety (incidence of adverse and serious adverse events) in all vaccinated participants, but we also assessed efficacy in a protocol-defined group of participants who received at least one dose of allocated vaccine. The primary efficacy endpoint was incident tuberculosis incorporating microbiological, radiological, and clinical criteria, and the secondary efficacy endpoint was M tuberculosis infection according to QuantiFERON TB Gold In-tube conversion (Cellestis, Australia). This trial was registered with the South African National Clinical Trials Register (DOH-27-0109-2654) and with ClinicalTrials.gov on July 31, 2009, number NCT00953927. FINDINGS: Between July 15, 2009, and May 4, 2011, we enrolled 2797 infants (1399 allocated MVA85A and 1398 allocated placebo). Median follow-up in the per-protocol population was 24.6 months (IQR 19.2-28.1), and did not differ between groups. More infants who received MVA85A than controls had at least one local adverse event (1251 [89%] of 1399 MVA85A recipients and 628 [45%] of 1396 controls who received the allocated intervention) but the numbers of infants with systemic adverse events (1120 [80%] and 1059 [76%]) or serious adverse events (257 [18%] and 258 (18%) did not differ between groups. None of the 648 serious adverse events in these 515 infants was related to MVA85A. 32 (2%) of 1399 MVA85A recipients met the primary efficacy endpoint (tuberculosis incidence of 1.15 per 100 person-years [95% CI 0.79 to 1.62]; with conversion in 178 [13%] of 1398 infants [95% CI 11.0 to 14.6]) as did 39 (3%) of 1395 controls (1.39 per 100 person-years [1.00 to 1.91]; with conversion in 171 [12%] of 1394 infants [10.6 to 14.1]). Efficacy against tuberculosis was 17.3% (95% CI -31.9 to 48.2) and against M tuberculosis infection was -3.8% (-28.1 to 15.9). INTERPRETATION: MVA85A was well tolerated and induced modest cell-mediated immune responses. Reasons for the absence of MVA85A efficacy against tuberculosis or M tuberculosis infection in infants need exploration.

23364003,Earlier introduction of aguitas is associated with higher risk of stunting in infants and toddlers in the Western Highlands of Guatemala.,Am J Clin Nutr,Doak CM and van der Starre RE and van Beusekom I and Campos Ponce M and Vossenaar M and Solomons NW,vu,"BACKGROUND: In many cultures, simple herbal infusions, thin gruels, or sweetened water (aguitas in Guatemalan parlance) are given to infants and toddlers. Formative research has shown that the use of aguitas in early child feeding is deeply embedded in Guatemalan culture. OBJECTIVE: We examined the prevalence and timing of the introduction of aguitas during early life in a low-income population of metropolitan Quetzaltenango in relation to stunting in children. DESIGN: Responses from 456 mothers of children aged 5-23 mo were analyzed by using logistic regression to explore relations between linear growth (stunting), diarrhea, and age at the first introduction of aguitas. RESULTS: A total of 358 of 456 infants (79%) were aguita users independent of sex or ethnicity. Of infants given aguitas, one-fourth of subjects were introduced to aguitas within the first 2.9 wk of age, and one-half of subjects were introduced to aguitas within the first 9 wk of age. Subjects introduced to aguitas before 2.9 wk of age were 1.8 times more likely to be stunted (95% CI: 1.1, 2.8; P = 0.03) irrespective of ethnicity. Children who had ever been given aguitas were twice as likely to have also had diarrhea (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3, 3.3) and more likely to have needed medical attention for diarrhea (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.2), but diarrheal experience was independent of stunting. CONCLUSION: Because of the early introduction of aguitas and the high prevalence of stunting in Guatemala, longitudinal studies are urgently needed to clarify the causal relations.

23386565,"Cancer statistics for African Americans, 2013.",CA Cancer J Clin,DeSantis C and Naishadham D and Jemal A,cancer,"In this article, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths for African Americans and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, survival, and screening prevalence based upon incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. It is estimated that 176,620 new cases of cancer and 64,880 deaths will occur among African Americans in 2013. From 2000 to 2009, the overall cancer death rate among males declined faster among African Americans than whites (2.4% vs 1.7% per year), but among females, the rate of decline was similar (1.5% vs 1.4% per year, respectively). The decrease in cancer death rates among African American males was the largest of any racial or ethnic group. The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of nearly 200,000 deaths from cancer among African Americans. Five-year relative survival is lower for African Americans than whites for most cancers at each stage of diagnosis. The extent to which these disparities reflect unequal access to health care versus other factors remains an active area of research. Overall, progress in reducing cancer death rates has been made, although more can and should be done to accelerate this progress through ensuring equitable access to cancer prevention, early detection, and state-of-the-art treatments.","Adolescent Adult African Americans/*statistics & numerical data Aged Aged, 80 and over Child Child, Preschool Early Detection of Cancer/statistics & numerical data European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Female Health Services Accessibility *Health Status Disparities Healthcare Disparities/ethnology Humans Incidence Infant Male Middle Aged Neoplasms/diagnosis/*ethnology/mortality Registries Survival Rate United States/epidemiology Young Adult"
23364002,Systematic review and meta-analysis of different dietary approaches to the management of type 2 diabetes.,Am J Clin Nutr,Ajala O and English P and Pinkney J,Missing,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence that reducing blood glucose concentrations, inducing weight loss, and improving the lipid profile reduces cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effect of various diets on glycemic control, lipids, and weight loss. DESIGN: We conducted searches of PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar to August 2011. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with interventions that lasted >/=6 mo that compared low-carbohydrate, vegetarian, vegan, low-glycemic index (GI), high-fiber, Mediterranean, and high-protein diets with control diets including low-fat, high-GI, American Diabetes Association, European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and low-protein diets. RESULTS: A total of 20 RCTs were included (n = 3073 included in final analyses across 3460 randomly assigned individuals). The low-carbohydrate, low-GI, Mediterranean, and high-protein diets all led to a greater improvement in glycemic control [glycated hemoglobin reductions of -0.12% (P = 0.04), -0.14% (P = 0.008), -0.47% (P < 0.00001), and -0.28% (P < 0.00001), respectively] compared with their respective control diets, with the largest effect size seen in the Mediterranean diet. Low-carbohydrate and Mediterranean diets led to greater weight loss [-0.69 kg (P = 0.21) and -1.84 kg (P < 0.00001), respectively], with an increase in HDL seen in all diets except the high-protein diet. CONCLUSION: Low-carbohydrate, low-GI, Mediterranean, and high-protein diets are effective in improving various markers of cardiovascular risk in people with diabetes and should be considered in the overall strategy of diabetes management.","Blood Glucose/analysis Cardiovascular Diseases/prevention & control Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*diet therapy *Diet, Carbohydrate-Restricted *Diet, Fat-Restricted *Diet, Mediterranean Diet, Protein-Restricted *Diet, Vegetarian Dietary Carbohydrates/administration & dosage Dietary Fats/administration & dosage Dietary Fiber/administration & dosage Dietary Proteins/administration & dosage Energy Intake Glycemic Index Humans Lipids/blood Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Risk Factors Weight Loss"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detectable NDAPs in human pituitary sections and death certificate reports of non-PrPsc ND in the NHPP database. RESULTS: We found mild amounts of pathological tau, Abeta, and alpha-synuclein deposits in the adeno/neurohypophysis of patients with ND and control patients. No cases of AD or PD were identified, and 3 deaths attributed to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were found among US NHPP c-hGH recipients, including 2 of the 796 decedents in the originally confirmed NHPP c-hGH cohort database. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite the likely frequent exposure of c-hGH recipients to NDAPs, and their markedly elevated risk of PrPsc-related disease, this population of NHPP c-hGH recipients does not appear to be at increased risk of AD or PD. We discovered 3 ALS cases of unclear significance among US c-hGH recipients despite the absence of pathological deposits of ALS-associated proteins (TDP-43, FUS, and ubiquilin) in human pituitary glands. In this unique in vivo model of human-to-human transmission, we found no evidence to support concerns that NDAPs underlying AD and PD transmit disease in humans despite evidence of their cell-to-cell transmission in model systems of these disorders. Further monitoring is required to confirm these conclusions.","Alzheimer Disease/*pathology Amyloid beta-Peptides/*metabolism Cadaver Cohort Studies Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data Female Human Growth Hormone/*adverse effects Humans Male Neurites/metabolism/pathology Neurons/pathology Parkinson Disease/*pathology Pituitary Gland/*metabolism/pathology United States United States Public Health Service alpha-Synuclein/*metabolism tau Proteins/*metabolism"
23398533,"The relationship between minimum alcohol prices, outlet densities and alcohol-attributable deaths in British Columbia, 2002-09.",Addiction,Zhao J and Stockwell T and Martin G and Macdonald S and Vallance K and Treno A and Ponicki WR and Tu A and Buxton J,Missing,"AIM: To investigate relationships between periodic increases in minimum alcohol prices, changing densities of liquor stores and alcohol-attributable (AA) deaths in British Columbia, Canada. DESIGN: Cross-section (16 geographic areas) versus time-series (32 annual quarters) panel analyses were conducted with AA deaths as dependent variables and price, outlet densities and socio-demographic characteristics as independent variables. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Populations of 16 Health Service Delivery Areas in British Columbia, Canada. MEASUREMENTS: Age-sex-standardized rates of acute, chronic and wholly AA mortality; population densities of restaurants, bars, government and private liquor stores; minimum prices of alcohol in dollars per standard drink. FINDINGS: A 10% increase in average minimum price for all alcoholic beverages was associated with a 31.72% [95% confidence interval (CI): +/- 25.73%, P < 0.05] reduction in wholly AA deaths. Significantly negative lagged associations were also detected up to 12 months after minimum price increases for wholly but not for acute or chronic AA deaths. Significant reductions in chronic and total AA deaths were detected between 2 and 3 years after minimum price increases. Significant but inconsistent lagged associations were detected for acute AA deaths. A 10% increase in private liquor stores was associated with a 2.45% (95% CI: +/- 2.39%, P < 0.05), 2.36% (95% CI: +/- 1.57%, P < 0.05) and 1.99% (95% CI: +/- 1.76%, P < 0.05) increase in acute, chronic and total AA mortality rates. CONCLUSION: Increases in the minimum price of alcohol in British Columbia, Canada, between 2002 and 2009 were associated with immediate and delayed decreases in alcohol-attributable mortality. By contrast, increases in the density of private liquor stores were associated with increases in alcohol-attributable mortality.",Adolescent Adult Aged Alcohol Drinking/economics/*mortality Alcoholic Beverages/*economics British Columbia/epidemiology Commerce/statistics & numerical data Cross-Sectional Studies Female Humans Male Middle Aged Socioeconomic Factors Young Adult

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled children with blunt torso trauma in 20 emergency departments. We used binary recursive partitioning to create a prediction rule to identify children at very low risk of intra-abdominal injuries undergoing acute intervention (therapeutic laparotomy, angiographic embolization, blood transfusion for abdominal hemorrhage, or intravenous fluid for >/=2 nights for pancreatic/gastrointestinal injuries). We considered only historical and physical examination variables with acceptable interrater reliability. RESULTS: We enrolled 12,044 children with a median age of 11.1 years (interquartile range 5.8, 15.1 years). Of the 761 (6.3%) children with intra-abdominal injuries, 203 (26.7%) received acute interventions. The prediction rule consisted of (in descending order of importance) no evidence of abdominal wall trauma or seat belt sign, Glasgow Coma Scale score greater than 13, no abdominal tenderness, no evidence of thoracic wall trauma, no complaints of abdominal pain, no decreased breath sounds, and no vomiting. The rule had a negative predictive value of 5,028 of 5,034 (99.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 99.7% to 100%), sensitivity of 197 of 203 (97%; 95% CI 94% to 99%), specificity of 5,028 of 11,841 (42.5%; 95% CI 41.6% to 43.4%), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.07 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.15). CONCLUSION: A prediction rule consisting of 7 patient history and physical examination findings, and without laboratory or ultrasonographic information, identifies children with blunt torso trauma who are at very low risk for intra-abdominal injury undergoing acute intervention. These findings require external validation before implementation.",Missing
23378621,Evidence of a strong association between frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels in T1D exchange clinic registry participants.,Diabetes Care,Miller KM and Beck RW and Bergenstal RM and Goland RS and Haller MJ and McGill JB and Rodriguez H and Simmons JH and Hirsch IB,jaeb,"OBJECTIVE: Despite substantial evidence of the benefit of frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in type 1 diabetes, certain insurers limit the number of test strips that they will provide. The large database of the T1D Exchange clinic registry provided an opportunity to evaluate the relationship between the number of SMBG measurements per day and HbA1c levels across a wide age range of children and adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The analysis included 20,555 participants in the T1D Exchange clinic registry with type 1 diabetes >/=1 year and not using a continuous glucose monitor (11,641 younger than age 18 years and 8,914 18 years old or older). General linear models were used to assess the association between the number of SMBG measurements and HbA1c levels after adjusting for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: A higher number of SMBG measurements per day were associated with non-Hispanic white race, insurance coverage, higher household income, and use of an insulin pump for insulin delivery (P < 0.001 for each factor). After adjusting for these factors, a higher number of SMBG measurements per day was strongly associated with a lower HbA1c level (adjusted P < 0.001), with the association being present in all age-groups and in both insulin pump and injection users. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong association between higher SMBG frequency and lower HbA1c levels. It is important for insurers to consider that reducing restrictions on the number of test strips provided per month may lead to improved glycemic control for some patients with type 1 diabetes.","Adolescent Adult Aged Blood Glucose/*metabolism Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring/*statistics & numerical data Child Child, Preschool Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*blood/metabolism Female Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated/*metabolism Humans Infant Insulin Infusion Systems Male Middle Aged Young Adult"

DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiological analysis of data from population-based congenital anomaly registries. SETTING: Fourteen European countries. POPULATION: A total of 5.4 million births 1984-2007, of which 3% were multiple births. METHODS: Cases of congenital anomaly included live births, fetal deaths from 20 weeks of gestation and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence rates per 10,000 births and relative risk of congenital anomaly in multiple versus singleton births (1984-2007); proportion prenatally diagnosed, proportion by pregnancy outcome (2000-07). Proportion of pairs where both co-twins were cases. RESULTS: Prevalence of congenital anomalies from multiple births increased from 5.9 (1984-87) to 10.7 per 10,000 births (2004-07). Relative risk of nonchromosomal anomaly in multiple births was 1.35 (95% CI 1.31-1.39), increasing over time, and of chromosomal anomalies was 0.72 (95% CI 0.65-0.80), decreasing over time. In 11.4% of affected twin pairs both babies had congenital anomalies (2000-07). The prenatal diagnosis rate was similar for multiple and singleton pregnancies. Cases from multiple pregnancies were less likely to be terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly, odds ratio 0.41 (95% CI 0.35-0.48) and more likely to be stillbirths and neonatal deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in babies who are both from a multiple pregnancy and affected by a congenital anomaly has implications for prenatal and postnatal service provision. The contribution of assisted reproductive technologies to the increase in risk needs further research. The deficit of chromosomal anomalies among multiple births has relevance for prenatal risk counselling.",Congenital Abnormalities/*epidemiology Europe/epidemiology Female Fetal Death/*epidemiology Humans *Multiple Birth Offspring Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications/*epidemiology Pregnancy Outcome Prenatal Diagnosis Prevalence Registries Risk Stillbirth/*epidemiology
23375674,"Psychotropic medications, including short acting benzodiazepines, strongly increase the frequency of falls in elderly.",Maturitas,van Strien AM and Koek HL and van Marum RJ and Emmelot-Vonk MH,umcutrecht,"OBJECTIVES: Falls in the elderly are common and often serious. The aim of this study was to examine the association between the use of different classes of psychotropic medications, especially short acting benzodiazepines, and the frequency of falling in elderly. Study design This retrospective cohort study was performed with patients who visited the day clinic of the department of geriatric medicine of the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands between 1 January 2011 and 1 April 2012. Measurements Frequencies of falling in the past year and medication use were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between the frequency of falling in the past year and the use of psychotropic medications. RESULTS: During this period 404 patients were included and 238 (58.9%) of them had experienced one or more falls in the past year. After multivariate adjustment, frequent falls remained significantly associated with exposure to psychotropic medications (odds ratio [OR] 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-3.28), antipsychotics (OR 3.62; 95% CI 1.27-10.33), hypnotics and anxiolytics (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.05-3.11), short-acting benzodiazepines or Z-drugs (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.10-3.42) and antidepressants (OR 2.35; 95% CI 1.33-4.16). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that taking psychotropic medication, including short-acting benzodiazepines, strongly increases the frequency of falls in elderly. This relation should be explicitly recognized by doctors prescribing for older people, and by older people themselves. If possible such medication should be avoided for elderly patients especially with other risk factors for falling.",Accidental Falls/*statistics & numerical data Aged Benzodiazepines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects Cohort Studies Female Humans Logistic Models Male Netherlands/epidemiology Psychotropic Drugs/*administration & dosage/adverse effects Questionnaires Retrospective Studies
23364012,High nutritional quality is not associated with low greenhouse gas emissions in self-selected diets of French adults.,Am J Clin Nutr,Vieux F and Soler LG and Touazi D and Darmon N,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Healthy diets are supposed to be more environmentally friendly because they rely mainly on plant-based foods, which have lower greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) per unit weight than do animal-based foods. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to estimate the GHGEs associated with the consumption of self-selected diets in France and to analyze their relation with the nutritional quality of diets. DESIGN: For each adult in the national dietary Individual and National Survey on Food Consumption (n = 1918), the GHGEs of his or her diet were estimated based on the GHGEs of 391 foods. Highest-nutritional-quality diets were defined as those having simultaneously 1) an energy density below the median, 2) a mean adequacy ratio (MAR) above the median, and 3) a mean excess ratio (MER, percentage of maximum recommended values for nutrients for which intake should be limited) below the median. RESULTS: MAR was positively correlated and MER was negatively correlated with diet-related GHGEs. High-nutritional-quality diets contained more plant-based foods, notably fruit and vegetables, and fewer sweets and salted snacks than did low-quality diets. After adjustment for age, sex, and energy intake, the consumption of sweets and salted snacks was negatively correlated with diet-related GHGEs, whereas the consumption of animal products and of fruit and vegetables was positively associated with them. After adjustment for energy intake, high-nutritional-quality diets had significantly higher GHGEs (+9% and +22% for men and women, respectively) than did low-nutritional-quality diets. CONCLUSION: Despite containing large amounts of plant-based foods, self-selected diets of the highest nutritional quality are currently not those with the lowest diet-related GHGEs.","Adult Aged Animals *Choice Behavior Cross-Sectional Studies *Diet Energy Intake European Continental Ancestry Group *Feeding Behavior Female *Food Preferences France Fruit *Greenhouse Effect Humans Linear Models Male Meat Middle Aged Models, Theoretical Nutritive Value Vegetables Young Adult"
23400757,Availability of consumer prices from US hospitals for a common surgical procedure.,JAMA Intern Med,Rosenthal JA and Lu X and Cram P,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Many proposals for health care reform incentivize patients to play a more active role in selecting health care providers on the basis of quality and price. While data on quality are increasingly available, availability of pricing data is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether we could obtain pricing data for a common elective surgical procedure, total hip arthroplasty (THA). DESIGN: We randomly selected 2 hospitals from each state (plus Washington, DC) that perform THA, as well as the 20 top-ranked orthopedic hospitals according to US News and World Report rankings. We contacted each hospital by telephone between May 2011 and July 2012. Using a standardized script, we requested from each hospital the lowest complete ""bundled price"" (hospital plus physician fees) for an elective THA that was required by one of the author's 62-year-old grandmother. In our scenario, the grandmother did not have insurance but had the means to pay out of pocket. We explained that we were seeking the lowest complete price for the procedure. When we encountered hospitals that could provide the hospital fee only, we contacted a random hospital affiliated orthopedic surgery practice to obtain the physician fee. Each hospital was contacted up to 5 times in efforts to obtain pricing information. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: All top-ranked and a sample of non-top-ranked US hospitals performing THA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of hospitals able to provide a complete price estimate for THA (physician and hospital fee) for top-ranked and non-top-ranked hospitals and range of prices quoted by each group. RESULTS: Nine top-ranked hospitals (45%) and 10 non-top-ranked hospitals (10%) were able to provide a complete bundled price (P < .001). We were able to obtain a complete price estimate from an additional 3 top-ranked hospitals (15%) and 54 non-top-ranked hospitals (53%) (P = .002) by contacting the hospital and physician separately. The range of complete prices was wide for both top-ranked ($12,500-$105,000) and non-top-ranked hospitals ($11,100-$125,798). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We found it difficult to obtain price information for THA and observed wide variation in the prices that were quoted. Many health care providers cannot provide reasonable price estimates. Patients seeking elective THA may find considerable price savings through comparison shopping.","Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip/*economics *Costs and Cost Analysis/standards/statistics & numerical data Empirical Research *Fees, Medical Health Care Surveys Health Services Accessibility/*economics/standards *Hospital Charges Hospitals/standards Humans Orthopedics/economics/standards Random Allocation Relative Value Scales Surgical Procedures, Elective/economics United States"
23380471,"Effect of day length on eye growth, myopia progression, and change of corneal power in myopic children.",Ophthalmology,Cui D and Trier K and Munk Ribel-Madsen S,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: Because of the northern location of Denmark, the length of the day over the year varies from 7 to 17.5 hours. Experimental and clinical results suggest that the development of myopia may be related to ambient light exposure. The purpose of current study was to investigate whether axial eye growth, myopia progression, or corneal power change in Danish myopic children varies with the length of the day. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirty-five children 8 to 14 years of age found to have myopia during screening for a clinical trial (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier, NCT00263471; accessed December 6, 2005). All children found to have any value of spherical equivalent that was myopic (<0 diopters [D]) at the first of 2 visits were included. METHODS: Cycloplegic refraction was measured using an autorefractor, axial eye length, and corneal power using an automatic combined noncontact partial coherence interferometer and keratometer. The accumulated number of daylight hours during the measurement period was calculated for each participant using an astronomical table. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change over 6 months in axial length, refraction, and corneal power. RESULTS: Accumulated hours of daylight ranged from 1660 to 2804 hours. Significant correlations were found between hours of daylight and eye elongation (P = 0.00), myopia progression (P = 0.01), and corneal power change (P = 0.00). In children with an average of 2782 +/- 19 hours of daylight, axial eye growth was 0.12 +/- 0.09 mm, myopia progression was 0.26 +/- 0.27 D, and corneal power change was 0.05 +/- 0.10 D per 6 months, whereas in children with an average of 1681 +/- 24 hours of daylight, axial eye growth was 0.19 +/- 0.10 mm, myopia progression was 0.32 +/- 0.27 D, and corneal power change was -0.04 +/- 0.08 D per 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Eye elongation and myopia progression seem to decrease in periods with longer days and to increase in periods with shorter days. Children should be encouraged to spend more time outside during daytime to prevent myopia.

This study examines the relationship between obesity and elevation, ambient temperature and urbanization. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data from a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of 422603 US adults containing BMI, behavioral (diet, physical activity, smoking) and demographic (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, employment, income) variables from the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were merged with elevation and temperature data from WorldClim and with urbanization data from the US Department of Agriculture. There was an approximately parabolic relationship between mean annual temperature and obesity, with maximum prevalence in counties with average temperatures near 18 degrees C. Urbanization and obesity prevalence exhibited an inverse relationship (30.9% in rural or nonmetro counties, 29.2% in metro counties with <250000 people, 28.1% in counties with population from 250000 to 1 million and 26.2% in counties with >1 million).

However, through the sale and promotion of tobacco, alcohol, and ultra-processed food and drink (unhealthy commodities), transnational corporations are major drivers of global epidemics of NCDs. What role then should these industries have in NCD prevention and control? We emphasise the rise in sales of these unhealthy commodities in low-income and middle-income countries, and consider the common strategies that the transnational corporations use to undermine NCD prevention and control. We assess the effectiveness of self-regulation, public-private partnerships, and public regulation models of interaction with these industries and conclude that unhealthy commodity industries should have no role in the formation of national or international NCD policy. Despite the common reliance on industry self-regulation and public-private partnerships, there is no evidence of their effectiveness or safety.

The Iowa photoscreening program, KidSight, has screened children from 6 months of age and older since 2000. We report our experience with vision screening in these children and compare the results of the photoscreens in children younger than 3 years with those of children of preschool age and older. METHODS: A retrospective review of results from the Iowa KidSight database using the MTI PhotoScreener containing results of children screened between May 1, 2000, and April 30, 2011. RESULTS: During the 11 years of the study, 210 695 photoscreens on children were performed at 13 750 sites. In the <3-year age group, the unreadable rate was 13.0%, the referral rate was 3.3%, and the overall positive-predictive value was 86.6%. In the 3- to 6-year-old children, the unreadable rate was 4.1%, the referral rate was 4.7%, and the overall positive-predictive value was 89.4%. CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant difference was found in screening children from 1 to 3 years old compared with screening children >3 years old. These results confirm that early screening, before amblyopia is more pronounced, can reliably detect amblyogenic risk factors in children younger than 3 years of age, and we recommend initiation of photoscreening in children aged 1 year and older.","Child Child, Preschool Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Infant Male Photography/*methods Retrospective Studies Vision Screening/instrumentation/*methods"

The epidemiological characteristics of injury in athletes seen at the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) combine and the effect of ACL reconstruction and meniscus surgery on longevity in the WNBA are unknown. PURPOSE: To evaluate the details and spectrum of injuries in athletes entering the WNBA combine and to assess the potential effect of specific injuries on the round drafted into the WNBA and career length. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: Demographic data and the documented collegiate injury profile were reviewed from the WNBA database for all players entering the WNBA combine in 2000-2008. The study included injury data on 506 athletes. Complete demographic data were available for 496 players. RESULTS: Of the athletes taking part in the combine, 45.2% were guards, 33.7% were forwards, and 21.1% were centers. Ankle sprain (47.8% of players), hand injury (20.8%), patellar tendinitis (17.0%), ACL injury (15.0%), meniscus injury (10.5%), stress fracture (7.3%), and concussion (7.1%) were the most common injuries reported. Seventy-three athletes (14.4%) reported ACL reconstruction before entering the WNBA combine, and meniscus surgery was the next most common surgery (n = 50 players; 9.9%). There were no differences in ACL or meniscus surgery when analyzed by player position or round drafted. History of ACL or meniscus surgery did not affect career length in the WNBA. Excluding ACL and meniscus surgery, other reported surgical procedures were knee arthroscopic surgery (11.7%), ankle reconstruction (2.6%), and shoulder stabilization (2.0%). CONCLUSION: The ankle is the most common site of injury and ACL reconstruction is the most common surgery in elite female athletes participating in the WNBA combine.

METHODS: We assessed research on psychological and pharmacological therapy as part of an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality-commissioned comparative effectiveness review. We conducted focused searches of Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Web of Science. Two trained reviewers independently selected, extracted data from, and rated the risk of bias of relevant trials and systematic reviews. We used qualitative rather than quantitative analysis methods because of statistical heterogeneity, insufficient numbers of similar studies, and variation in outcome reporting. RESULTS: We found a total of 21 trials and 1 cohort study of medium or low risk of bias from our review of 6647 unduplicated abstracts. We generally did not find studies that attempted to replicate findings of effective interventions. In the short term, no pharmacotherapy intervention demonstrated efficacy, and only a few psychological treatments (each with elements of cognitive behavioral therapy) showed benefit. The body of evidence provides little insight into how interventions to treat children exposed to trauma might influence healthy long-term development. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings serve as a call to action: Psychotherapeutic intervention may be beneficial relative to no treatment in children exposed to traumatic events. Definitive guidance, however, requires far more research on the comparative effectiveness of interventions targeting children exposed to nonrelational traumatic events.","Child Cognitive Therapy/methods Early Medical Intervention/*methods Humans Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/*prevention & control/therapy Psychotherapy/*methods Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods Stress Disorders, Traumatic/*epidemiology/*therapy Treatment Outcome"

Meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.,Am J Clin Nutr,Livesey G and Taylor R and Livesey H and Liu S,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Although much is known about the association between dietary glycemic load (GL) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), prospective cohort studies have not consistently shown a positive dose-response relation. OBJECTIVE: We performed a comprehensive examination of evidence on the dose response that links GL to T2D and sources of heterogeneity among all prospective cohort studies on healthy adults available in the literature. DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review of all prospective cohort studies and meta-analyses to quantify the GL-T2D relation both without and with adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: Among 24 prospective cohort studies identified by August 2012, the GL ranged from approximately 60 to approximately 280 g per daily intake of 2000 kcal (8.4 MJ). In a fully adjusted meta-analysis model, the GL was positively associated with RR of T2D of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.31, 1.61) for a 100-g increment in GL (P < 0.001; n = 24 studies; 7.5 million person-years of follow-up). Sex (P = 0.03), dietary instrument validity (P < 0.001), and ethnicity (European American compared with other; P = 0.04) together explained 97% of the heterogeneity among studies. After adjustment for heterogeneities, we used both funnel and trim-and-fill analyses to identify a negligible publication bias. Multiple influence, cumulative, and forecast analyses indicated that the GL-T2D relation tended to have reached stability and to have been underestimated. The relation was apparent at all doses of GL investigated, although it was statistically significant only at >95 g GL/2000 kcal. CONCLUSION: After we accounted for several sources of heterogeneity, findings from prospective cohort studies that related the GL to T2D appear robust and consistently indicate strong and significantly lower T2D risk in persons who consume lower-GL diets.

23399718,Mortality benefits from US population-wide reduction in sodium consumption: projections from 3 modeling approaches.,Hypertension,Coxson PG and Cook NR and Joffres M and Hong Y and Orenstein D and Schmidt SM and Bibbins-Domingo K,ucsf,"Computer simulations have been used to estimate the mortality benefits from population-wide reductions in dietary sodium, although comparisons of these estimates have not been rigorously evaluated. We used 3 different approaches to model the effect of sodium reduction in the US population over the next 10 years, incorporating evidence for direct effects on cardiovascular disease mortality (method 1), indirect effects mediated by blood pressure changes as observed in randomized controlled trials of antihypertension medications (method 2), or epidemiological studies (method 3).The 3 different modeling approaches were used to model the same scenarios: scenario A, gradual uniform reduction totaling 40% over 10 years; scenario B, instantaneous 40% reduction in sodium consumption sustained for 10 years to achieve a population-wide mean of 2200 mg/d; and scenario C, instantaneous reduction to 1500 mg sodium per day sustained for 10 years. All 3 methods consistently show a substantial health benefit for reductions in dietary sodium under each of the 3 scenarios tested. A gradual reduction in dietary sodium over the next decade (scenario A) as might be achieved with a range of proposed public health interventions would yield considerable health benefits over the next decade, with mean effects across the 3 models ranging from 280 000 to 500 000 deaths averted. Projections of instantaneous reductions illustrate the maximum benefits that could be achieved (0.7-1.2 million deaths averted in 10 years). Under 3 different modeling assumptions, the projected health benefits from reductions in dietary sodium are substantial.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use Cardiovascular Diseases/*mortality Computer Simulation/statistics & numerical data Epidemiologic Studies Female Forecasting/methods Humans Hypertension/diet therapy/drug therapy/mortality Male Middle Aged *Models, Biological Mortality/*trends Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Sodium, Dietary/administration & dosage/*adverse effects United States/epidemiology"
23374102,Male circumcision decreases penile sensitivity as measured in a large cohort.,BJU Int,Bronselaer GA and Schober JM and Meyer-Bahlburg HF and T'Sjoen G and Vlietinck R and Hoebeke PB,Missing,"WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: The sensitivity of the foreskin and its importance in erogenous sensitivity is widely debated and controversial. This is part of the actual public debate on circumcision for non-medical reason. Today some studies on the effect of circumcision on sexual function are available. However they vary widely in outcome. The present study shows in a large cohort of men, based on self-assessment, that the foreskin has erogenous sensitivity. It is shown that the foreskin is more sensitive than the uncircumcised glans mucosa, which means that after circumcision genital sensitivity is lost. In the debate on clitoral surgery the proven loss of sensitivity has been the strongest argument to change medical practice. In the present study there is strong evidence on the erogenous sensitivity of the foreskin. This knowledge hopefully can help doctors and patients in their decision on circumcision for non-medical reason. OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that sensitivity of the foreskin is a substantial part of male penile sensitivity. To determine the effects of male circumcision on penile sensitivity in a large sample. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study aimed at a sample size of approximately 1000 men. Given the intimate nature of the questions and the intended large sample size, the authors decided to create an online survey. Respondents were recruited by means of leaflets and advertising. RESULTS: The analysis sample consisted of 1059 uncircumcised and 310 circumcised men. For the glans penis, circumcised men reported decreased sexual pleasure and lower orgasm intensity. They also stated more effort was required to achieve orgasm, and a higher percentage of them experienced unusual sensations (burning, prickling, itching, or tingling and numbness of the glans penis). For the penile shaft a higher percentage of circumcised men described discomfort and pain, numbness and unusual sensations. In comparison to men circumcised before puberty, men circumcised during adolescence or later indicated less sexual pleasure at the glans penis, and a higher percentage of them reported discomfort or pain and unusual sensations at the penile shaft. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the importance of the foreskin for penile sensitivity, overall sexual satisfaction, and penile functioning. Furthermore, this study shows that a higher percentage of circumcised men experience discomfort or pain and unusual sensations as compared with the uncircumcised population. Before circumcision without medical indication, adult men, and parents considering circumcision of their sons, should be informed of the importance of the foreskin in male sexuality.","Adolescent Adult Aged Arousal/*physiology Circumcision, Male/*methods *Focus Groups Foreskin/innervation/*surgery Humans Male Middle Aged Pain Threshold/*physiology Penis/*innervation/surgery Personal Satisfaction Questionnaires Sensation Sexual Behavior Touch/*physiology Young Adult"

DESIGN: Record-linkage study. SETTING: Health maintenance organization in Israel. PATIENT(S): A total of 87,403 women evaluated and/or treated for infertility on or after September 25, 1994, who were followed for cancer development through June 22, 2011: 522 breast, 41 endometrial, 45 ovarian, 311 in situ cervical, and 32 invasive cervical cancers were identified. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Hazard ratios (HRs) for specific cancers. RESULT(S): We found no significant relationships of IVF exposures to the risks of breast, endometrial, or ovarian cancers. However, compared with women with no fertility treatment, the HR for ovarian cancer associated with IVF was 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75-3.29), with higher risk among those receiving four or more cycles (HR 1.78, 95% CI 0.76-4.13). There was also a nonsignificantly elevated risk for endometrial cancer among women who received 1-3 IVF cycles (HR 1.94, 95% CI 0.73-5.12), but additional cycles were associated with less risk. In contrast, the risk of in situ cervical cancer was significantly reduced and invasive cervical cancer nonsignificantly reduced among women receiving IVF as well as other fertility treatments. CONCLUSION(S): Our results regarding long-term effects were largely reassuring, but women receiving IVF should continue to be monitored given that the procedures involve potent ovulation stimulators and repeated ovarian punctures.","Adult Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology Endometrial Neoplasms/epidemiology Female Fertilization in Vitro/*adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data Follow-Up Studies Genital Neoplasms, Female/*epidemiology Health Maintenance Organizations/statistics & numerical data Humans Israel/epidemiology Middle Aged Ovarian Neoplasms/epidemiology Pregnancy Proportional Hazards Models Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Time Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology Young Adult"
23394433,"Looking at the label and beyond: the effects of calorie labels, health consciousness, and demographics on caloric intake in restaurants.",Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,Ellison B and Lusk JL and Davis D,illinois,"BACKGROUND: Recent legislation has required calorie labels on restaurant menus as a means of improving Americans' health. Despite the growing research in this area, no consensus has been reached on the effectiveness of menu labels. This suggests the possibility of heterogeneity in responses to caloric labels across people with different attitudes and demographics. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential relationships between caloric intake and diners' socio-economic characteristics and attitudes in a restaurant field experiment that systematically varied the caloric information printed on the menus. METHODS: We conducted a field experiment in a full service restaurant where patrons were randomly assigned to one of three menu treatments which varied the amount of caloric information printed on the menus (none, numeric, or symbolic calorie label). At the conclusion of their meals, diners were asked to complete a brief survey regarding their socio-economic characteristics, attitudes, and meal selections. Using regression analysis, we estimated the number of entree and extra calories ordered by diners as a function of demographic and attitudinal variables. Additionally, irrespective of the menu treatment to which a subject was assigned, our study identified which types of people are likely to be low-, medium-, and high-calorie diners. RESULTS: Results showed that calorie labels have the greatest impact on those who are least health conscious. Additionally, using a symbolic calorie label can further reduce the caloric intake of even the most health conscious patrons. Finally, calorie labels were more likely to influence the selection of the main entree as opposed to supplemental items such as drinks and desserts. CONCLUSIONS: If numeric calorie labels are implemented (as currently proposed), they are most likely to influence consumers who are less health conscious - probably one of the key targets of this legislation. Unfortunately, numeric labels did little for those consumers who were already more knowledgeable about health and nutrition. To reach a broader group of diners, a symbolic calorie label may be preferred as it reduced caloric intake across all levels of health consciousness.","Adolescent Adult Consciousness *Diet *Energy Intake Female *Food Labeling *Health Behavior *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Humans Male *Meals Middle Aged *Restaurants Socioeconomic Factors United States Young Adult"
23420923,A quality improvement program to reduce unnecessary referrals for adolescent scoliosis.,Pediatrics,Vernacchio L and Trudell EK and Hresko MT and Karlin LI and Risko W,harvard,"OBJECTIVE: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a relatively common reason for referral to orthopedic surgery, but most referred patients do not require bracing or surgery. We developed a quality improvement (QI) program within the Pediatric Physicians' Organization at Children's, an independent practice association affiliated with Boston Children's Hospital, to reduce unnecessary specialty referrals for AIS. METHODS: The QI program consisted of physician education, decision support tools available at the point of care, and longitudinal feedback of data on physician referrals for AIS. Referral patterns in the 2-year postintervention period were tracked and compared with those of the 2-year preintervention period. Clinical characteristics of referred patients were compared through claims analysis and chart review. RESULTS: Initial visits to orthopedic surgery for AIS declined from 5.1 to 4.1 per 1000 adolescents per year, a reduction of 20.4% (P = .01). Process control chart analysis showed a rapid change in referral patterns after the initiation of the program which was sustained over the 2-year postintervention period and demonstrated that 66 initial and 131 total AIS specialty visits were avoided as a result of the program. CONCLUSIONS: A QI program consisting of physician education, decision support available at the point of care, and longitudinal data feedback led to a sustained reduction in unnecessary referrals for AIS. This program can serve as a model for other programs that seek to shift the locus of care from specialists to primary care providers.",Adolescent Child Clinical Competence/*standards Cohort Studies Humans Longitudinal Studies Physicians/*standards Point-of-Care Systems/standards Quality Improvement/*standards Referral and Consultation/*standards Scoliosis/*diagnosis/epidemiology
23422412,Efficient replication of the novel human betacoronavirus EMC on primary human epithelium highlights its zoonotic potential.,MBio,Kindler E and Jonsdottir HR and Muth D and Hamming OJ and Hartmann R and Rodriguez R and Geffers R and Fouchier RA and Drosten C and Muller MA and Dijkman R and Thiel V,Missing,"The recent emergence of a novel human coronavirus (HCoV-EMC) in the Middle East raised considerable concerns, as it is associated with severe acute pneumonia, renal failure, and fatal outcome and thus resembles the clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) observed in 2002 and 2003. Like SARS-CoV, HCoV-EMC is of zoonotic origin and closely related to bat coronaviruses. The human airway epithelium (HAE) represents the entry point and primary target tissue for respiratory viruses and is highly relevant for assessing the zoonotic potential of emerging respiratory viruses, such as HCoV-EMC. Here, we show that pseudostratified HAE cultures derived from different donors are highly permissive to HCoV-EMC infection, and by using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and RNAseq data, we experimentally determined the identity of seven HCoV-EMC subgenomic mRNAs. Although the HAE cells were readily responsive to type I and type III interferon (IFN), we observed neither a pronounced inflammatory cytokine nor any detectable IFN responses following HCoV-EMC, SARS-CoV, or HCoV-229E infection, suggesting that innate immune evasion mechanisms and putative IFN antagonists of HCoV-EMC are operational in the new host. Importantly, however, we demonstrate that both type I and type III IFN can efficiently reduce HCoV-EMC replication in HAE cultures, providing a possible treatment option in cases of suspected HCoV-EMC infection. IMPORTANCE A novel human coronavirus, HCoV-EMC, has recently been described to be associated with severe respiratory tract infection and fatalities, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) observed during the 2002-2003 epidemic. Closely related coronaviruses replicate in bats, suggesting that, like SARS-CoV, HCoV-EMC is of zoonotic origin. Since the animal reservoir and circumstances of zoonotic transmission are yet elusive, it is critically important to assess potential species barriers of HCoV-EMC infection. An important first barrier against invading respiratory pathogens is the epithelium, representing the entry point and primary target tissue of respiratory viruses. We show that human bronchial epithelia are highly susceptible to HCoV-EMC infection. Furthermore, HCoV-EMC, like other coronaviruses, evades innate immune recognition, reflected by the lack of interferon and minimal inflammatory cytokine expression following infection. Importantly, type I and type III interferon treatment can efficiently reduce HCoV-EMC replication in the human airway epithelium, providing a possible avenue for treatment of emerging virus infections.","Animals Coronaviridae/growth & development/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity/*physiology Coronavirus Infections/virology Cytokines/biosynthesis Epithelial Cells/*virology Humans Immune Evasion Middle East RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics RNA, Viral/biosynthesis/genetics Respiratory Tract Infections/virology Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Sequence Analysis, RNA *Virus Replication Zoonoses/virology"

These pathways simultaneously allow Na(+) influx, causing [Na(+)] in the infected erythrocyte cytosol to increase to high levels. The intraerythrocytic parasite itself maintains a low cytosolic [Na(+)] via unknown mechanisms. Here we present evidence that the intraerythrocytic parasite actively extrudes Na(+) against an inward gradient via PfATP4, a parasite plasma membrane protein with sequence similarities to Na(+)-ATPases of lower eukaryotes. Mutations in PfATP4 confer resistance to a potent class of antimalarials, the spiroindolones. Consistent with this, the spiroindolones cause a profound disruption in parasite Na(+) homeostasis, which is attenuated in parasites bearing resistance-conferring mutations in PfATP4. The mutant parasites also show some impairment of Na(+) regulation. Taken together, our results are consistent with PfATP4 being a Na(+) efflux ATPase and a target of the spiroindolones.",Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics/*metabolism Antimalarials/*pharmacology Cation Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism Drug Resistance Enzyme Activation Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects/metabolism Erythrocytes/metabolism/parasitology Homeostasis Humans Indoles/pharmacology Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism Mutation Ouabain/pharmacology Parasitic Sensitivity Tests Plasmodium falciparum/drug effects/*enzymology/genetics Protozoan Proteins/genetics/metabolism Sodium/*metabolism Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism Spiro Compounds/pharmacology Trophozoites/drug effects/metabolism

Although TMAs have the potential to facilitate protein expression profiling on a scale to rival experiments of tumour transcriptomes, the bottleneck and imprecision of manually scoring TMAs has impeded progress. METHODS: We report image analysis algorithms adapted from astronomy for the precise automated analysis of IHC in all subcellular compartments. The power of this technique is demonstrated using over 2000 breast tumours and comparing quantitative automated scores against manual assessment by pathologists. RESULTS: All continuous automated scores showed good correlation with their corresponding ordinal manual scores. For oestrogen receptor (ER), the correlation was 0.82, P<0.0001, for BCL2 0.72, P<0.0001 and for HER2 0.62, P<0.0001. Automated scores showed excellent concordance with manual scores for the unsupervised assignment of cases to 'positive' or 'negative' categories with agreement rates of up to 96%.

23406673,A case-crossover analysis of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and air pollution.,Circulation,Ensor KB and Raun LH and Persse D,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Evidence of an association between the exposure to air pollution and overall cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is increasingly found in the literature. However, results from studies of the association between acute air pollution exposure and risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are inconsistent for fine particulate matter, and, although pathophysiological evidence indicates a plausible link between OHCA and ozone, none has been reported. Approximately 300 000 persons in the United States experience an OHCA each year, of which >90% die. Understanding the association provides important information to protect public health. METHODS AND RESULTS: The association between OHCA and air pollution concentrations hours and days before onset was assessed by using a time-stratified case-crossover design using 11 677 emergency medical service-logged OHCA events between 2004 and 2011 in Houston, Texas. Air pollution concentrations were obtained from an extensive area monitor network. An average increase of 6 microg/m(3) in fine particulate matter 2 days before onset was associated with an increased risk of OHCA (1.046; 95% confidence interval, 1.012-1.082). A 20-ppb ozone increase for the 8-hour average daily maximum was associated with an increased risk of OHCA on the day of the event (1.039; 95% confidence interval, 1.005-1.073). Each 20-ppb increase in ozone in the previous 1 to 3 hours was associated with an increased risk of OHCA (1.044; 95% confidence interval, 1.004-1.085). Relative risk estimates were higher for men, blacks, or those aged >65 years.

OBJECTIVE: To test whether bullying and/or being bullied in childhood predicts psychiatric problems and suicidality in young adulthood after accounting for childhood psychiatric problems and family hardships. DESIGN: Prospective, population-based study. SETTING: Community sample from 11 counties in Western North Carolina. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1420 participants who had being bullied and bullying assessed 4 to 6 times between the ages of 9 and 16 years. Participants were categorized as bullies only, victims only, bullies and victims (hereafter referred to as bullies/victims), or neither. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Psychiatric outcomes, which included depression, anxiety, antisocial personality disorder, substance use disorders, and suicidality (including recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or a suicide attempt), were assessed in young adulthood (19, 21, and 24-26 years) by use of structured diagnostic interviews. RESULTS Victims and bullies/victims had elevated rates of young adult psychiatric disorders, but also elevated rates of childhood psychiatric disorders and family hardships. After controlling for childhood psychiatric problems or family hardships, we found that victims continued to have a higher prevalence of agoraphobia (odds ratio [OR], 4.6 [95% CI, 1.7-12.5]; P < .01), generalized anxiety (OR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.1-6.3]; P < .001), and panic disorder (OR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.5-6.5]; P < .01) and that bullies/victims were at increased risk of young adult depression (OR, 4.8 [95% CI, 1.2-19.4]; P < .05), panic disorder (OR, 14.5 [95% CI, 5.7-36.6]; P < .001), agoraphobia (females only; OR, 26.7 [95% CI, 4.3-52.5]; P < .001), and suicidality (males only; OR, 18.5 [95% CI, 6.2-55.1]; P < .001).

METHODS: Interrupted time series study using Hospital Episodes Statistics data from April 2002 to November 2010. Sample consisted of all children (aged </=14 years) having an emergency hospital admission with a principle diagnosis of asthma. RESULTS: Before the implementation of the legislation, the admission rate for childhood asthma was increasing by 2.2% per year (adjusted rate ratio 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.03). After implementation of the legislation, there was a significant immediate change in the admission rate of -8.9% (adjusted rate ratio 0.91; 95% CI: 0.89-0.93) and change in time trend of -3.4% per year (adjusted rate ratio 0.97; 95% CI: 0.96-0.98). This change was equivalent to 6802 fewer hospital admissions in the first 3 years after implementation. There were similar reductions in asthma admission rates among children from different age, gender, and socioeconomic status groups and among those residing in urban and rural locations.

PURPOSE: To examine whether a single injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is more effective than placebo (saline) or glucocorticoid in reducing pain in adults with LE after 3 months. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: A total of 60 patients with chronic LE were randomized (1:1:1) to receive either a blinded injection of PRP, saline, or glucocorticoid. The primary end point was a change in pain using the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) questionnaire at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were ultrasonographic changes in tendon thickness and color Doppler activity. RESULTS: Pain reduction at 3 months (primary end point) was observed in all 3 groups, with no statistically significant difference between the groups; mean differences were the following: glucocorticoid versus saline: -3.8 (95% CI, -9.9 to 2.4); PRP versus saline: -2.7 (95% CI, -8.8 to 3.5); and glucocorticoid versus PRP: -1.1 (95% CI, -7.2 to 5.0). At 1 month, however, glucocorticoid reduced pain more effectively than did both saline and PRP; mean differences were the following: glucocorticoid versus saline: -8.1 (95% CI, -14.3 to -1.9); and glucocorticoid versus PRP: -9.3 (95% CI, -15.4 to -3.2). Among the secondary outcomes, at 3 months, glucocorticoid was more effective than PRP and saline in reducing color Doppler activity and tendon thickness. For color Doppler activity, mean differences were the following: glucocorticoid versus PRP: -2.6 (95% CI, -3.1 to -2.2); and glucocorticoid versus saline: -2.0 (95% CI, -2.5 to -1.6). For tendon thickness, mean differences were the following: glucocorticoid versus PRP: -0.5 (95% CI, -0.8 to -0.2); and glucocorticoid versus saline: -0.8 (95% CI, -1.2 to -0.5). CONCLUSION: Neither injection of PRP nor glucocorticoid was superior to saline with regard to pain reduction in LE at the primary end point at 3 months. However, injection of glucocorticoid had a short-term pain-reducing effect at 1 month in contrast to the other therapies. Injection of glucocorticoid in LE reduces both color Doppler activity and tendon thickness compared with PRP and saline.","Disability Evaluation Double-Blind Method Female Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use Humans Injections, Intra-Articular Male Middle Aged Pain Measurement *Platelet-Rich Plasma Tendons/ultrasonography Tennis Elbow/*therapy/ultrasonography Triamcinolone/*therapeutic use Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color"
23319626,Correlations between cannabis use and IQ change in the Dunedin cohort are consistent with confounding from socioeconomic status.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Rogeberg O,Missing,"Does cannabis use have substantial and permanent effects on neuropsychological functioning? Renewed and intense attention to the issue has followed recent research on the Dunedin cohort, which found a positive association between, on the one hand, adolescent-onset cannabis use and dependence and, on the other hand, a decline in IQ from childhood to adulthood [Meier et al. (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109(40):E2657-E2664]. The association is given a causal interpretation by the authors, but existing research suggests an alternative confounding model based on time-varying effects of socioeconomic status on IQ. A simulation of the confounding model reproduces the reported associations from the Dunedin cohort, suggesting that the causal effects estimated in Meier et al. are likely to be overestimates, and that the true effect could be zero. Further analyses of the Dunedin cohort are proposed to distinguish between the competing interpretations. Although it would be too strong to say that the results have been discredited, the methodology is flawed and the causal inference drawn from the results premature.","Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Female Humans *Intelligence Male Marijuana Abuse/*epidemiology/*psychology *Models, Biological Norway/epidemiology Socioeconomic Factors"

METHODS: A prospective analysis was conducted of data from an Australian population-based cohort with 4 examinations during a 15-year period (1992-1994 to 2007-2009). Participants completed a detailed questionnaire at baseline assessing aspirin use, cardiovascular disease status, and AMD risk factors. Age-related macular degeneration was graded side-by-side from retinal photographs taken at each study visit to assess the incidence of neovascular (wet) AMD and geographic atrophy (dry AMD) according to the international AMD classification. RESULTS: Of 2389 baseline participants with follow-up data available, 257 individuals (10.8%) were regular aspirin users and 63 of the 2389 developed neovascular AMD. Persons who were regular aspirin users were more likely to have incident neovascular AMD: the 15-year cumulative incidence was 9.3% in users and 3.7% in nonusers. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, history of cardiovascular disease, systolic blood pressure, and body mass index, persons who were regular aspirin users had a higher risk of developing neovascular AMD (odds ratio [OR], 2.46; 95% CI, 1.25-4.83). The association showed a dose-response effect (multivariate-adjusted P = .01 for trend). Aspirin use was not associated with the incidence of geographic atrophy (multivariate-adjusted OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.59-1.65). CONCLUSION: Regular aspirin use is associated with increased risk of incident neovascular AMD, independent of a history of cardiovascular disease and smoking.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Aspirin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Australia Cardiovascular Diseases/drug therapy/prevention & control Cohort Studies Female Humans Incidence Logistic Models Macular Degeneration/classification/epidemiology/*etiology Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies Risk Factors Smoking"
23315899,Association of tattooing and hepatitis C virus infection: a multicenter case-control study.,Hepatology,Carney K and Dhalla S and Aytaman A and Tenner CT and Francois F,Missing,"Although injection drug use (IDU) and blood transfusions prior to 1992 are well-accepted risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, many studies that evaluated tattooing as a risk factor for HCV infection did not control for a history of IDU or transfusion prior to 1992. In this large, multicenter, case-control study, we analyzed demographic and HCV risk factor exposure history data from 3,871 patients, including 1,930 with chronic HCV infection (HCV RNA-positive) and 1,941 HCV-negative (HCV antibody-negative) controls. Crude and fully adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of tattoo exposure by multivariate logistic regression in HCV-infected versus controls were determined. As expected, IDU (65.9% versus 17.8%; P < 0.001), blood transfusion prior to 1992 (22.3% versus 11.1%; P < 0.001), and history of having one or more tattoos (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 3.23-4.49; P < 0.001) were more common in HCV-infected patients than in control subjects. After excluding all patients with a history of ever injecting drugs and those who had a blood transfusion prior to 1992, a total of 1,886 subjects remained for analysis (465 HCV-positive patients and 1,421 controls). Among these individuals without traditional risk factors, HCV-positive patients remained significantly more likely to have a history of one or more tattoos after adjustment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity (OR, 5.17; 95% CI, 3.75-7.11; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Tattooing is associated with HCV infection, even among those without traditional HCV risk factors such as IDU and blood transfusion prior to 1992.",Adult Aged Case-Control Studies Female Hepatitis C/*etiology Humans Male Middle Aged Odds Ratio Risk Factors Tattooing/*adverse effects
23341510,Associations of recreational physical activity and leisure time spent sitting with colorectal cancer survival.,J Clin Oncol,Campbell PT and Patel AV and Newton CC and Jacobs EJ and Gapstur SM,cancer,"PURPOSE: Little is known about the association of recreational physical activity or leisure time spent sitting with survival after colorectal cancer diagnosis. This study examined the associations of prediagnosis and postdiagnosis recreational physical activity and leisure time spent sitting with mortality among patients with colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a cohort of adults without colorectal cancer at baseline in 1992-1993, we identified 2,293 participants who were diagnosed with invasive, nonmetastatic colorectal cancer up to mid-2007. At baseline, before their cancer diagnosis, and again after their cancer diagnosis, participants completed detailed questionnaires that included information concerning recreational physical activity and leisure time spent sitting. RESULTS: During a maximum follow-up of 16.1 years after colorectal cancer diagnosis, 846 patients with colorectal cancer died, 379 of them from colorectal cancer. Engaging in 8.75 or more metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week of recreational physical activity (equivalent to approximately 150 minutes per week of walking) compared with fewer than 3.5 MET hours per week was associated with lower all-cause mortality (prediagnosis physical activity: relative risk [RR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.89; postdiagnosis physical activity: RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.71). Spending 6 or more hours per day of leisure time sitting compared with fewer than 3 hours per day was associated with higher all-cause mortality (prediagnosis sitting time: RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.68; postdiagnosis sitting time: RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.64). CONCLUSION: More recreational physical activity before and after colorectal cancer diagnosis was associated with lower mortality, whereas longer leisure time spent sitting was associated with higher risk of death.",Adult Aged Body Mass Index Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality Cohort Studies Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*mortality/pathology/therapy Diabetes Complications/mortality Educational Status Female Follow-Up Studies Food Habits Humans Hypertension/complications *Leisure Activities Male Meat Middle Aged *Motor Activity Multivariate Analysis Neoplasm Grading Odds Ratio Proportional Hazards Models Questionnaires Risk Risk Factors Smoking/adverse effects
23283500,Mediterranean diet and cognitive function: a French study.,Am J Clin Nutr,Kesse-Guyot E and Andreeva VA and Lassale C and Ferry M and Jeandel C and Hercberg S and Galan P,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Evidence on the association between Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) adherence and cognition is presently inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to investigate the association between midlife MedDiet adherence and cognitive performance assessed 13 y later among participants in the SU.VI.MAX (Supplementation with Vitamins and Mineral Antioxidants) study and to test the hypothesis of effect modification by occupation and education as cognitive reserve markers. DESIGN: A Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and a Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern Score (MSDPS) were estimated by using repeated 24-h dietary records (1994-1996) from 3083 middle-aged subjects. Cognitive performance was assessed in 2007-2009 by using 6 neuropsychological tests, and a composite score was built. Subgroup analyses were performed according to occupational and educational status. Mean differences and 95% CIs were estimated through covariance analyses. RESULTS: After potential confounders were accounted for, no association between MDS or MSDPS and cognitive scores was detected except for a lower phonemic fluency score with decreasing MSDPS (P = 0.048) and a lower backward digit span score with decreasing MDS (P = 0.03). In turn, a low MDS was related to a lower composite cognitive score in the small subsample of manual workers (n = 178, P-interaction = 0.04) who could be hypothesized to have low cognitive reserve. MedDiet adherence did not interact with educational level in relation to cognitive function. CONCLUSION: This study did not find support for a beneficial effect of MedDiet adherence on cognitive function, irrespective of educational level, which is the strongest indicator of cognitive reserve.","*Aging Biological Markers *Cognitive Reserve Diet/adverse effects Diet Records *Diet, Mediterranean Double-Blind Method Female Follow-Up Studies France/epidemiology Humans Incidence Longitudinal Studies Male Middle Aged Mild Cognitive Impairment/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control Patient Compliance"

OBJECTIVES: We estimate overall and age-specific prevalence of cross-reactive antibodies to H1N1pdm virus and rates of H1N1pdm infection during the first year of the pandemic using data from published and unpublished H1N1pdm seroepidemiological studies. METHODS: Primary aggregate H1N1pdm serologic data from each study were stratified in standardized age groups and evaluated based on when sera were collected in relation to national or subnational peak H1N1pdm activity. Seropositivity was assessed using well-described and standardized hemagglutination inhibition (HI titers >/= 32 or >/= 40) and microneutralization (MN >/= 40) laboratory assays. The prevalence of cross-reactive antibodies to the H1N1pdm virus was estimated for studies using sera collected prior to the start of the pandemic (between 2004 and April 2009); H1N1pdm cumulative incidence was estimated for studies in which collected both pre- and post-pandemic sera; and H1N1pdm seropositivity was calculated from studies with post-pandemic sera only (collected between December 2009-June 2010). RESULTS: Data from 27 published/unpublished studies from 19 countries/administrative regions - Australia, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Iran, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Reunion Island, Singapore, United Kingdom, United States, and Vietnam - were eligible for inclusion. The overall age-standardized pre-pandemic prevalence of cross-reactive antibodies was 5% (95%CI 3-7%) and varied significantly by age with the highest rates among persons >/= 65 years old (14% 95%CI 8-24%). Overall age-standardized H1N1pdm cumulative incidence was 24% (95%CI 20-27%) and varied significantly by age with the highest in children 5-19 (47% 95%CI 39-55%) and 0-4 years old (36% 95%CI 30-43%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results offer unique insight into the global impact of the H1N1 pandemic and highlight the need for standardization of seroepidemiological studies and for their inclusion in pre-pandemic preparedness plans. Our results taken together with recent global pandemic respiratory-associated mortality estimates suggest that the case fatality ratio of the pandemic virus was approximately 0.02%.","Age Factors Antibodies, Viral/*immunology Humans Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification Influenza, Human/*epidemiology/immunology Pandemics Seroepidemiologic Studies United States"

We aimed to assess any effects on site-specific cancer rates in the randomised trials of folic acid supplementation, at doses higher than those from fortification. METHODS: In these meta-analyses, we sought all trials completed before 2011 that compared folic acid versus placebo, had scheduled treatment duration at least 1 year, included at least 500 participants, and recorded data on cancer incidence. We obtained individual participant datasets that included 49,621 participants in all 13 such trials (ten trials of folic acid for prevention of cardiovascular disease [n=46,969] and three trials in patients with colorectal adenoma [n=2652]). All these trials were evenly randomised. The main outcome was incident cancer (ignoring non-melanoma skin cancer) during the scheduled treatment period (among participants who were still free of cancer). We compared those allocated folic acid with those allocated placebo, and used log-rank analyses to calculate the cancer incidence rate ratio (RR). FINDINGS: During a weighted average scheduled treatment duration of 5.2 years, allocation to folic acid quadrupled plasma concentrations of folic acid (57.3 nmol/L for the folic acid groups vs 13.5 nmol/L for the placebo groups), but had no significant effect on overall cancer incidence (1904 cancers in the folic acid groups vs 1809 cancers in the placebo groups, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.99-1.13, p=0.10). There was no trend towards greater effect with longer treatment. There was no significant heterogeneity between the results of the 13 individual trials (p=0.23), or between the two overall results in the cadiovascular prevention trials and the adenoma trials (p=0.13). Moreover, there was no significant effect of folic acid supplementation on the incidence of cancer of the large intestine, prostate, lung, breast, or any other specific site. INTERPRETATION: Folic acid supplementation does not substantially increase or decrease incidence of site-specific cancer during the first 5 years of treatment. Fortification of flour and other cereal products involves doses of folic acid that are, on average, an order of magnitude smaller than the doses used in these trials.

PURPOSE: This study examined whether commuting by car was associated with adults' weight gain over 4 years. METHODS: Among 822 adult residents of Adelaide, Australia, weight change was ascertained from self-reported weight at baseline (2003-2004) and at follow-up (2007-2008). Using time spent for car commuting and work status at baseline, participants were categorized as non-car commuters, occasional car commuters, and daily car commuters. Multilevel linear regression (conducted in 2012) examined associations of weight change with car-commuting category, adjusting for potential confounding variables, for the whole sample, and among those who were physically inactive or active (>/=150 minutes/week) in their leisure time. RESULTS: For the overall sample, adjusted mean weight gain (95% CI) over 4 years was 1.26 (0.64, 1.89) kg for non-car commuters; 1.53 (0.69, 2.37) kg for occasional car commuters; and 2.18 (1.44, 2.92) kg for daily car commuters (p for trend=0.090). Stratified analyses found a stronger association for those with sufficient leisure-time physical activity. For non-car commuters with sufficient leisure-time physical activity, the adjusted mean weight gain was 0.46 (-0.43, 1.35) kg, which was not significantly greater than 0. CONCLUSIONS: Over 4 years, those who used cars daily for commuting tended to gain more weight than those who did not commute by car. This relationship was pronounced among those who were physically active during leisure time.

23349357,Lightning and its association with the frequency of headache in migraineurs: an observational cohort study.,Cephalalgia,Martin GV and Houle T and Nicholson R and Peterlin A and Martin VT,Missing,"AIM: The aim of this article is to determine if lightning is associated with the frequency of headache in migraineurs. METHODS: Participants fulfilling diagnostic criteria for International Headache Society-defined migraine were recruited from sites located in Ohio ( N = 23) and Missouri ( N = 67). They recorded headache activity in a daily diary for three to six months. A generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression determined the odds ratio (OR) of headache on lightning days compared to non-lightning days. Other weather factors associated with thunderstorms were also added as covariates to the GEE model to see how they would attenuate the effect of lightning on headache. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 44 and 91% were female. The OR for headache was 1.31 (95% confidence limits (CL); 1.07, 1.66) during lighting days as compared to non-lightning days. The addition of thunderstorm-associated weather variables as covariates were only able to reduce the OR for headache on lightning days to 1.18 (95% CL; 1.02, 1.37). The probability of having a headache on lightning days was also further increased when the average current of lightning strikes for the day was more negative. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that lightning represents a trigger for headache in migraineurs that cannot be completely explained by other meteorological factors. It is unknown if lightning directly triggers headaches through electromagnetic waves or indirectly through production of bioaerosols (e.g. ozone), induction of fungal spores or other mechanisms. These results should be interpreted cautiously until replicated in a second dataset.",Adult Cohort Studies Female Humans *Lightning Male Migraine Disorders/*epidemiology/*etiology

STUDY DESIGN: Fifty children aged 5 months or younger with positional head deformity were included in this prospective clinical trial (n=20 plagiocephaly, n=10 brachycephaly, n=20 combination). A random distribution was performed for treatment with the bedding pillow alone (n=25) or with stretching exercises (n=25) for 6 weeks. Anthropometric caliper measurements were done before and after that interval. Cranial vault asymmetry index (CVAI) and cranial index (CI) were calculated and analyzed using a descriptive statistical general linear model. RESULTS: DeltaCVAI in the stretching group was 2.09% for plagiocephaly and 2.34% for combined head deformities. Using the bedding pillow, DeltaCVAI was 3.01% in plagiocephal children and 2.86% for combined head deformity. The DeltaCI in the stretching group was 0.94% for isolated brachycephal children and 2.24% for combined head deformity. DeltaCI in the pillow group was 3.63% for brachycephaly and 3.23% in children with combined head deformities, respectively.

We set out to determine the diagnostic accuracy of clinical judgment based on signs and symptoms to detect radiographic pneumonia in patients presenting with acute cough in primary care. In 2810 European patients with acute cough, general practitioners (GPs) recorded whether they considered pneumonia to be present (""yes"" or ""no"") immediately after history and physical examination. Chest radiography was performed within 1 week by local radiologists blind to other patient characteristics. 140 patients had radiographic pneumonia (5%), of whom 41 (29%) had been diagnosed as such. 31 (1%) patients had a clinical diagnosis that was not confirmed by radiography (n=2670). In clinically suspected pneumonia, 57% of subjects were subsequently diagnosed with radiographic pneumonia. Negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity and specificity of GPs' clinical judgment were 96%, 29% and 99%, respectively. Compared to patients with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, less severe symptoms were found in radiographic pneumonia cases not suspected clinically (p<0.05). The predictive values of GPs' clinical judgment, particularly the high NPVs, are helpful in routine care. Nonetheless, the majority of diagnoses of radiographic pneumonias was not suspected on clinical grounds. There is a need to further support the detection of clinically relevant pneumonia in primary care.","Adult Aged Cough/*diagnosis/*radiography Female General Practitioners Humans Judgment Male Middle Aged Physical Examination/methods Pneumonia/*diagnosis/*radiography Predictive Value of Tests Primary Health Care/methods Radiography, Thoracic/*methods Reproducibility of Results Sensitivity and Specificity"

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, Scotland, UK. POPULATION: All women with first deliveries recorded in the Aberdeen Maternity and Neonatal Databank (AMND) between 1986 and 2005. METHODS: All women identified from the AMND were classified into exposed and unexposed cohorts, according to whether or not they had PPH in their first delivery. They were then linked to any records of a second pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Any second pregnancy, time to second pregnancy, early or late pregnancy loss, and prevalence of PPH in the second pregnancy. RESULTS: Out of 34 334 women, 10% had a PPH in their first pregnancy. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to a second pregnancy, nor in the outcome of that second pregnancy, between women who had experienced a PPH in their first pregnancy and women who had not. For women with a caesarean delivery, there was a significant reduction in the proportion conceiving again, comparing the exposed and unexposed cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: From this cohort study we can conclude that if a PPH occurs in a first pregnancy, there is no delay in achieving a second pregnancy, and no detrimental effect on the outcome of that pregnancy.

Here we report that the CC genotype is found in 69% of Chinese patients with severe pandemic influenza A H1N1/09 virus infection compared with 25% in those with mild infection. Specifically, the CC genotype was estimated to confer a sixfold greater risk for severe infection than the CT and TT genotypes. More importantly, because the risk genotype occurs with such a high frequency, its effect translates to a large population-attributable risk of 54.3% for severe infection in the Chinese population studied compared with 5.4% in Northern Europeans. Interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 genetic variants could, therefore, have a strong effect of the epidemiology of influenza in China and in people of Chinese descent.","Adult Alleles Antibodies, Viral/blood Asian Continental Ancestry Group/*genetics Chemokine CCL2/blood China Female Gene Frequency/genetics Genes, Recessive/genetics *Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/physiology Influenza, Human/blood/*genetics/immunology/*virology Male Membrane Proteins/*genetics Models, Genetic Odds Ratio Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics Severity of Illness Index Young Adult"
23362014,Comparison of age at natural menopause in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with a non-clinic-based sample of women in northern California.,Cancer,Lin WT and Beattie M and Chen LM and Oktay K and Crawford SL and Gold EB and Cedars M and Rosen M,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) are related to an increased lifetime risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Although risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy reduces the risk of both cancers, loss of fertility is a major concern. A recent study suggested an association between BRCA1 mutation and occult primary ovarian insufficiency. The objective of the current study was to determine whether BRCA1/2 mutation carriers have an earlier onset of natural menopause compared with unaffected women. METHODS: White carriers of the BRCA1/2 gene (n = 382) were identified within the Breast Cancer Risk Program Registry at the University of California at San Francisco and compared with non-clinic-based white women in northern California (n = 765). The 2 groups were compared with regard to median age at the time of natural menopause before and after adjustment for known risk factors, and the role of smoking within each group was examined using the Kaplan-Meier approach for unadjusted analyses and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses for adjusted analyses. RESULTS: The median age at the time of natural menopause in the BRCA1/2 carriers was significantly younger than among the unaffected sample (50 years vs 53 years; P < .001). The unadjusted hazard ratio for natural menopause when comparing BRCA1/2 carriers with unaffected women was 4.06 (95% confidence interval, 3.03-5.45) and was 3.98 (95% confidence interval, 2.87-5.53) after adjusting for smoking, parity, and oral contraceptive use. For BRCA1/2 carriers who were current heavy smokers (smoking >/= 20 cigarettes/day), the median age at natural menopause was 46 years versus 49 years for nonsmokers (P = .027). CONCLUSIONS: The BRCA1/2 mutation was associated with a significantly earlier age at natural menopause, and heavy smoking compounded this risk. Because the relationship between menopause and the end of natural fertility is considered to be fixed, these findings suggest the risk of earlier infertility among BRCA1/2 carriers.","*Age Factors California Case-Control Studies Female *Genes, BRCA1 *Genes, BRCA2 *Heterozygote Detection Humans *Menopause Middle Aged *Mutation"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 2-year, prospective, randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled study was carried out in pregnant outpatients with a parent with type 2 diabetes who were treated from the end of the first trimester with 2 g myo-inositol plus 200 microg folic acid twice a day (n = 110) and in the placebo group (n = 110), who were only treated with 200 microg folic acid twice a day. The main outcome measure was the incidence of GDM in both groups. Secondary outcome measures were as follows: the incidence of fetal macrosomia (>4,000 g), gestational hypertension, preterm delivery, caesarean section, shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and neonatal distress respiratory syndrome. GDM diagnosis was performed according to the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) recommendations. RESULTS: Incidence of GDM was significantly reduced in the myo-inositol group compared with the placebo group: 6 vs. 15.3%, respectively (P = 0.04). In the myo-inositol group, a reduction of GDM risk occurrence was highlighted (odds ratio 0.35). A statistically significant reduction of fetal macrosomia in the myo-inositol group was also highlighted together with a significant reduction in mean fetal weight at delivery. In the other secondary outcome measures, there were no differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS: myo-Inositol supplementation in pregnant women with a family history of type 2 diabetes may reduce GDM incidence and the delivery of macrosomia fetuses.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy Diabetes, Gestational/*drug therapy Female Humans Inositol/*therapeutic use Pregnancy Prospective Studies"

A large, population-based series of women who underwent BCT or mastectomy was studied to observe whether outcomes of RCT were achieved in the general population, and whether survival differed by surgery type when stratified by age and hormone receptor (HR) status. METHODS: Information was obtained regarding all women diagnosed in the state of California with stage I or II breast cancer between 1990 and 2004, who were treated with either BCT or mastectomy and followed for vital status through December 2009. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compare overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) between BCT and mastectomy groups. Analyses were stratified by age group (< 50 years and >/= 50 years) and tumor HR status. RESULTS: A total of 112,154 women fulfilled eligibility criteria. Women undergoing BCT had improved OS and DSS compared with women with mastectomy (adjusted hazard ratio for OS entire cohort = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80-0.83). The DSS benefit with BCT compared with mastectomy was greater among women age >/= 50 with HR-positive disease (hazard ratio = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.82-0.91) than among women age < 50 with HR-negative disease (hazard ratio = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.79-0.98); however, this trend was seen among all subgroups analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with early stage breast cancer, BCT was associated with improved DSS. These data provide confidence that BCT remains an effective alternative to mastectomy for early stage disease regardless of age or HR status.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antigens, CD4/metabolism Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/*mortality/pathology/radiotherapy/surgery Combined Modality Therapy Female Humans Mastectomy/*mortality Mastectomy, Segmental/*mortality Middle Aged"
23364007,Risk of hospitalization or death from ischemic heart disease among British vegetarians and nonvegetarians: results from the EPIC-Oxford cohort study.,Am J Clin Nutr,Crowe FL and Appleby PN and Travis RC and Key TJ,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Few previous prospective studies have examined differences in incident ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk between vegetarians and nonvegetarians. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the association of a vegetarian diet with risk of incident (nonfatal and fatal) IHD. DESIGN: A total of 44,561 men and women living in England and Scotland who were enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Oxford study, of whom 34% consumed a vegetarian diet at baseline, were part of the analysis. Incident cases of IHD were identified through linkage with hospital records and death certificates. Serum lipids and blood pressure measurements were available for 1519 non cases, who were matched to IHD cases by sex and age. IHD risk by vegetarian status was estimated by using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: After an average follow-up of 11.6 y, there were 1235 IHD cases (1066 hospital admissions and 169 deaths). Compared with nonvegetarians, vegetarians had a lower mean BMI [in kg/m(2); -1.2 (95% CI: -1.3, -1.1)], non-HDL-cholesterol concentration [-0.45 (95% CI: -0.60, -0.30) mmol/L], and systolic blood pressure [-3.3 (95% CI: -5.9, -0.7) mm Hg]. Vegetarians had a 32% lower risk (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.81) of IHD than did nonvegetarians, which was only slightly attenuated after adjustment for BMI and did not differ materially by sex, age, BMI, smoking, or the presence of IHD risk factors. CONCLUSION: Consuming a vegetarian diet was associated with lower IHD risk, a finding that is probably mediated by differences in non-HDL cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure.","Adult Blood Pressure Body Mass Index Choice Behavior Cholesterol, LDL/blood Cohort Studies *Diet, Vegetarian England/epidemiology *European Continental Ancestry Group Female Follow-Up Studies *Food Habits Food Preferences Hospitalization Humans Incidence Life Style Male Middle Aged Myocardial Ischemia/*epidemiology Neoplasms/epidemiology Nutritional Status Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Scotland/epidemiology Smoking/adverse effects"
23352752,The effect of an ambulance diversion ban on emergency department length of stay and ambulance turnaround time.,Ann Emerg Med,Burke LG and Joyce N and Baker WE and Biddinger PD and Dyer KS and Friedman FD and Imperato J and King A and Maciejko TM and Pearlmutter MD and Sayah A and Zane RD and Epstein SK,harvard,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Massachusetts became the first state in the nation to ban ambulance diversion in 2009. It was feared that the diversion ban would lead to increased emergency department (ED) crowding and ambulance turnaround time. We seek to characterize the effect of a statewide ambulance diversion ban on ED length of stay and ambulance turnaround time at Boston-area EDs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, pre-post observational analysis of 9 Boston-area hospital EDs before and after the ban. We used ED length of stay as a proxy for ED crowding. We compared hospitals individually and in aggregate to determine any changes in ED length of stay for admitted and discharged patients, ED volume, and turnaround time. RESULTS: No ED experienced an increase in ED length of stay for admitted or discharged patients or ambulance turnaround time despite an increase in volume for several EDs. There was an overall 3.6% increase in ED volume in our sample, a 10.4-minute decrease in length of stay for admitted patients, and a 2.2-minute decrease in turnaround time. When we compared high- and low-diverting EDs separately, neither saw an increase in length of stay, and both saw a decrease in turnaround time. CONCLUSION: After the first statewide ambulance diversion ban, there was no increase in ED length of stay or ambulance turnaround time at 9 Boston-area EDs. Several hospitals actually experienced improvements in these outcome measures. Our results suggest that the ban did not worsen ED crowding or ambulance availability at Boston-area hospitals.","Ambulances/organization & administration/*statistics & numerical data Boston Crowding Emergency Service, Hospital/organization & administration/*statistics & numerical data Health Policy Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data Humans Length of Stay/*statistics & numerical data Patient Discharge/statistics & numerical data Patient Transfer/organization & administration Retrospective Studies Time Factors"
23340895,Randomized crossover study to examine the necessity of an injection-to-meal interval in patients with type 2 diabetes and human insulin.,Diabetes Care,Muller N and Frank T and Kloos C and Lehmann T and Wolf G and Muller UA,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with diabetes and insulin therapy with human insulin were usually instructed to use an interval of 20-30 min between the injection and meal. We examined the necessity of the injection-to-meal interval (IMI) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and flexible insulin therapy with human insulin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized, open crossover trial, 100 patients with T2DM (47% men, mean age = 66.7 years) were randomized to the IMI first group (phase 1, IMI 20 min; phase 2, no IMI) or IMI last group (phase 1, no IMI; phase 2, IMI 20 min). The main outcome measures were HbA1c, blood glucose profile, incidence of hypoglycemia, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and patient preference. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were randomized to the IMI first group and 51 patients to the IMI last group. Omitting the IMI only slightly increases HbA1c (average intraindividual difference = 0.08% [95% CI 0.01-0.15]). Since the difference is not clinically relevant, a therapy without IMI is noninferior to its application (P < 0.001). In the secondary outcomes, the incidence of mild hypoglycemia also did not differ between no IMI and IMI significantly (mean of differences = -0.10, P = 0.493). No difference in the blood glucose profile of both groups was found. Treatment satisfaction increased markedly, by 8.08, if IMI was omitted (P < 0.001). The total score of the quality of life measure did not show differences between applying an IMI or not. Insulin therapy without IMI was preferred by 86.5% of patients (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An IMI for patients with T2DM and preprandial insulin therapy is not necessary.","Aged Blood Glucose/drug effects Cross-Over Studies Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy Female Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated/metabolism Humans Hypoglycemia/chemically induced Hypoglycemic Agents/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Insulin/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Male Middle Aged Postprandial Period"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Diabetes cases were obtained through a retrospective population-based registry. Hospital inpatient and outpatient records were reviewed for cases of type 1 and type 2 diabetes diagnosed from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004. The secondary source of validation was the School District of Philadelphia. Time series analysis was used to evaluate the changing pattern of incidence over the 20-year period. RESULTS: The overall age-adjusted incidence rate in 2000-2004 of 17.0 per 100,000 per year was significantly higher than that of previous cohorts, with an average yearly increase of 1.5% and an average 5-year cohort increase of 7.8% (P = 0.025). The incidence in white children (19.2 per 100,000 per year) was 48% higher than in the previous cohort. Children aged 0-4 years had a 70% higher incidence (12.2 per 100,000 per year) than the original cohort; this increase was most marked in young black children. The overall age-adjusted incidence of type 2 diabetes was 5.8 per 100,000 per year and was significantly higher in black children. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of type 1 diabetes is rising among children in Philadelphia. The incidence rate has increased by 29% since the 1985-1989 cohort. The most marked increases were among white children ages 10-14 years and black children ages 0-4 years. The incidence of type 1 diabetes is 18 times higher than that of type 2 in white children but only 1.6 times higher in black children.","Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*epidemiology Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology Female Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Male Philadelphia/epidemiology"

The study goal was to compare the effectiveness of HBO with other conventional therapies administered in a wound care network for the treatment of a diabetic foot ulcer and prevention of lower-extremity amputation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a longitudinal observational cohort study. To address treatment selection bias, we used propensity scores to determine the ""propensity"" that an individual was selected to receive HBO. RESULTS: We studied 6,259 individuals with diabetes, adequate lower limb arterial perfusion, and foot ulcer extending through the dermis, representing 767,060 person-days of wound care. In the propensity score-adjusted models, individuals receiving HBO were less likely to have healing of their foot ulcer (hazard ratio 0.68 [95% CI 0.63-0.73]) and more likely to have an amputation (2.37 [1.84-3.04]). Additional analyses, including the use of an instrumental variable, were conducted to assess the robustness of our results to unmeasured confounding. HBO was not found to improve the likelihood that a wound might heal or to decrease the likelihood of amputation in any of these analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Use of HBO neither improved the likelihood that a wound would heal nor prevented amputation in a cohort of patients defined by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services eligibility criteria. The usefulness of HBO in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers needs to be reevaluated.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Amputation/*statistics & numerical data Diabetic Foot/*surgery/*therapy Female Humans *Hyperbaric Oxygenation Longitudinal Studies Male Middle Aged Treatment Outcome"
23429927,Cochlear implantation in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Gaylor JM and Raman G and Chung M and Lee J and Rao M and Lau J and Poe DS,bu,"IMPORTANCE: Sensorineural hearing loss is the third leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide. Cochlear implants may provide a viable alternative to hearing aids for this type of hearing loss. The Coverage and Analysis Group at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services was interested in an evaluation of recently published literature on this topic. In addition, this meta-analysis is to our knowledge the first to evaluate quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes in adults with cochlear implants. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the communication-related outcomes and health-related QOL outcomes after unilateral or bilateral cochlear implantation in adults with sensorineural hearing loss. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and previous reports from January 1, 2004, through May 31, 2012. STUDY SELECTION: Published studies of adult patients undergoing unilateral or bilateral procedures with multichannel cochlear implants and assessments using open-set sentence tests, multisyllable word tests, or QOL measures. DATA EXTRACTION: Five researchers extracted information on population characteristics, outcomes of interest, and study design and assessed the studies for risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. RESULTS: A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most unilateral implant studies showed a statistically significant improvement in mean speech scores as measured by open-set sentence or multisyllable word tests; meta-analysis revealed a significant improvement in QOL after unilateral implantation. Results from studies assessing bilateral implantation showed improvement in communication-related outcomes compared with unilateral implantation and additional improvements in sound localization compared with unilateral device use or implantation only. Based on a few studies, the QOL outcomes varied across tests after bilateral implantation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Unilateral cochlear implants provide improved hearing and significantly improve QOL, and improvements in sound localization are noted for bilateral implantation. Future studies of longer duration, higher-quality reporting, and large databases or registries of patients with long-term follow-up data are needed to yield stronger evidence.","Adult *Cochlear Implants Hearing Loss, Sensorineural/*rehabilitation Humans *Quality of Life Sound Localization Speech Perception"

The purpose of this analysis was to estimate the percentages of adults who, on a given day, drank more than these limits and the percentages who drank too heavily; that is, more than four drinks for men and more than three for women. Dietary intake data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2009-2010, were analyzed. Using a computer-assisted protocol, 24-hour dietary recalls were collected from 2,740 men and 2,941 women, age 21 years and older. Results were weighted to be nationally representative. Estimated mean daily intake was 1.2 drinks for men and 0.4 for women (1 drink=14 g of ethanol). On a given day, 36% of men and 21% of women consumed alcohol. Whereas 82% of men and 89% of women did not exceed the DGA's limits, 8% of men had more than four drinks, and 3% of women had more than three, amounts defined as heavy. The percentages who drank more than the DGA's limits varied by age group and were highest among men age 31 to 50 years and women age 51 to 70 years.

We conducted a randomized trial of this diet pattern for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. METHODS: In a multicenter trial in Spain, we randomly assigned participants who were at high cardiovascular risk, but with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment, to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat). Participants received quarterly individual and group educational sessions and, depending on group assignment, free provision of extra-virgin olive oil, mixed nuts, or small nonfood gifts. The primary end point was the rate of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes). On the basis of the results of an interim analysis, the trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 4.8 years. RESULTS: A total of 7447 persons were enrolled (age range, 55 to 80 years); 57% were women. The two Mediterranean-diet groups had good adherence to the intervention, according to self-reported intake and biomarker analyses. A primary end-point event occurred in 288 participants. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.92) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.96) for the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil (96 events) and the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with nuts (83 events), respectively, versus the control group (109 events). No diet-related adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Among persons at high cardiovascular risk, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events.

We examined whether adding adjunctive alcohol intervention to batterer intervention reduced the likelihood of substance use and violence relative to batterer intervention alone. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Batterer intervention programs in Rhode Island, USA. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 252 hazardous drinking men in batterer intervention programs. Participants were randomized to receive 40 hours of standard batterer program (SBP) or the SBP plus a 90-minute alcohol intervention (SBP + BAI). None withdrew due to adverse effects. Data were collected at baseline, 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up, with follow-up rates of 95, 89 and 82%, respectively. MEASUREMENTS: Substance use was measured with a well-validated calendar-assisted interview. Violence was measured with a validated questionnaire. Arrest records were obtained for all participants. The primary substance use outcome was drinks per drinking day (DPDD) and the primary violence outcome was frequency of any physical IPV. FINDINGS: Relative to SBP alone, men receiving SBP + BAI reported consuming fewer DPDD at 3-month follow-up [B = -1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.65, -0.04, P = 0.04] but not 6- or 12-month follow-up. In secondary analyses, men receiving SBP + BAI reported significantly greater abstinence at 3- (B = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.14, P = 0.002) and 6-month (B = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.11, P = 0.01) follow-up but not 12-month follow-up. There were no significant differences in physical IPV between men receiving SBP and men receiving SBP + BAI. In secondary analyses, men receiving SBP + BAI reported less severe physical aggression at 3-month (IRR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.65, P = 0.009) but not 6- or 12-month follow-up. Men receiving SBP + BAI reported less severe psychological aggression (B = -1.24, 95% CI: -2.47, -0.02, P = 0.04) and fewer injuries to partners at 3- and 6-month follow-up (IRR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.92, P = 0.03), with differences fading by 12 months.

23439629,Effectiveness of strengthened stimulation during acupuncture for the treatment of Bell palsy: a randomized controlled trial.,CMAJ,Xu SB and Huang B and Zhang CY and Du P and Yuan Q and Bi GJ and Zhang GB and Xie MJ and Luo X and Huang GY and Wang W,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The traditional Chinese theory of acupuncture emphasizes that the intensity of acupuncture must reach a threshold to generate de qi, which is necessary to achieve the best therapeutic effect. De qi is an internal compound sensation of soreness, tingling, fullness, aching, cool, warmth and heaviness, and a radiating sensation at and around the acupoints. However, the notion that de qi must be achieved for maximum benefit has not been confirmed by modern scientific evidence. METHODS: We performed a prospective multicentre randomized controlled trial involving patients with Bell palsy. Patients were randomly assigned to the de qi (n = 167) or control (n = 171) group. Both groups received acupuncture: in the de qi group, the needles were manipulated manually until de qi was reached, whereas in the control group, the needles were inserted without any manipulation. All patients received prednisone as a basic treatment. The primary outcome was facial nerve function at month 6. We also assessed disability and quality of life 6 months after randomization. RESULTS: After 6 months, patients in the de qi group had better facial function (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 4.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.23-7.78), better disability assessment (differences of least squares means 9.80, 95% CI 6.29-13.30) and better quality of life (differences of least squares means 29.86, 95% CI 22.33-37.38). Logistic regression analysis showed a positive effect of the de qi score on facial-nerve function (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.04-1.09). INTERPRETATION: Among patients with Bell palsy, acupuncture with strong stimulation that elicited de qi had a greater therapeutic effect, and stronger intensity of de qi was associated with the better therapeutic effects.

This study investigates the association between maternal alcohol-use disorder and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and infant mortality not classified as SIDS using linked, population-based health and mortality data. METHODS: Exposed mothers were identified through the presence of an International Classification of Diseases 9/10 alcohol diagnosis, a proxy for alcohol-use disorder, recorded on health, mental health, and/or drug and alcohol datasets (1983-2005). Comparison mothers without an alcohol diagnosis were frequency matched to exposed mothers on maternal age within maternal race and year of birth of their children. All offspring with their birth recorded on the Midwives Notification System compose the exposed (n = 21 841) and comparison (n = 56 054) cohorts. Cases of SIDS (n = 303) and infant mortality excluding SIDS (n = 598) were identified through linkage with the Western Australian Mortality Register. Analyses were conducted by using Cox regression and results presented as adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The highest risk of SIDS occurred when a maternal alcohol diagnosis was recorded during pregnancy (aHR 6.92, 95% CI 4.02-11.90) or within 1 year postpregnancy (aHR 8.61, 95% CI 5.04-14.69). An alcohol diagnosis recorded during pregnancy more than doubled the risk of infant deaths (excluding SIDS) (aHR 2.35, 95% CI 1.45-3.83). Maternal alcohol-use disorder is attributable for at least 16.41% (95% CI 9.73%-23.69%) of SIDS and 3.40% (95% CI 2.28%-4.67%) of infant deaths not classified as SIDS. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal alcohol-use disorder is a significant risk factor for SIDS and infant mortality excluding SIDS.","Adult Alcoholism/diagnosis/*epidemiology Cohort Studies Female Humans *Infant Mortality Infant, Newborn Population Surveillance/methods Pregnancy Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/diagnosis/*mortality Sudden Infant Death/diagnosis/*epidemiology Young Adult"

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. Clinical information and results of sleep tests were extracted from hospital notes between August 2011 and February 2012 and reviewed by an expert panel to confirm the diagnosis. Vaccination and clinical histories were obtained from general practitioners. SETTING: Sleep centres and paediatric neurology centres in England. PARTICIPANTS: Children and young people aged 4-18 with onset of narcolepsy from January 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The odds of vaccination in those with narcolepsy compared with the age matched English population after adjustment for clinical conditions that were indications for vaccination. The incidence of narcolepsy within six months of vaccination compared with the incidence outside this period measured with the self controlled cases series method. RESULTS: Case notes for 245 children and young people were reviewed; 75 had narcolepsy (56 with cataplexy) and onset after 1 January 2008. Eleven had been vaccinated before onset; seven within six months. In those with a diagnosis by July 2011 the odds ratio was 14.4 (95% confidence interval 4.3 to 48.5) for vaccination at any time before onset and 16.2 (3.1 to 84.5) for vaccination within six months before onset. The relative incidence from the self controlled cases series analysis in those with a diagnosis by July 2011 with onset from October 2008 to December 2010 was 9.9 (2.1 to 47.9). The attributable risk was estimated as between 1 in 57,500 and 1 in 52,000 doses. CONCLUSION: The increased risk of narcolepsy after vaccination with ASO3 adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 vaccine indicates a causal association, consistent with findings from Finland. Because of variable delay in diagnosis, however, the risk might be overestimated by more rapid referral of vaccinated children.","Adjuvants, Immunologic/adverse effects Adolescent Child Child, Preschool England/epidemiology Female Humans Incidence Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/*immunology Influenza Vaccines/*adverse effects Male Narcolepsy/*epidemiology/etiology Odds Ratio Retrospective Studies"
23440730,Annual number of lung cancer deaths potentially avertable by screening in the United States.,Cancer,Ma J and Ward EM and Smith R and Jemal A,cancer,"BACKGROUND: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), which was conducted between 2002 and 2009, demonstrated that screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduced lung cancer mortality by 20% among screening-eligible populations compared with chest x-ray. In this article, the authors provide an estimate of the annual number of lung cancer deaths that can be averted by screening, assuming the screening regimens adopted in the NLST are fully implemented in the United States. METHODS: The annual number of lung cancer deaths that can be averted by screening was estimated as a product of the screening effect, the US population size (obtained from the 2010 US Census data), the prevalence of screening eligibility (estimated using the 2010 National Health Interview Survey [NHIS] data), and the lung cancer mortality rates among screening-eligible populations (estimated using the NHIS data from 2000-2004 and the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey linked mortality files). Analyses were performed separately by sex, age, and smoking status, with Poisson regression analysis used for mortality rate estimation. Uncertainty of the estimates of the number of avertable lung cancer deaths was quantified by simulation. RESULTS: Approximately 8.6 million Americans (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 8.0 million-9.2 million), including 5.2 million men (95% CI, 4.8 million-5.7 million) and 3.4 million women (95% CI, 3.0 million -3.8 million), were eligible for lung cancer screening in 2010. If the screening regimen adopted in the NLST was fully implemented among these screening-eligible US populations, a total of 12,250 (95% CI, 10,170-15,671) lung cancer deaths (8990 deaths in men and 3260 deaths in women) would be averted each year. CONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study indicate that LDCT screening could potentially avert approximately 12,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States. Further studies are needed to estimate the number of avertable lung cancer deaths and the cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening under different scenarios of risk, various screening frequencies, and various screening uptake rates.","Aged Early Detection of Cancer Female Humans Lung Neoplasms/*mortality/*prevention & control Male Middle Aged Smoking Tomography, X-Ray Computed United States/epidemiology"

Prime Time, a youth development intervention, aims to reduce pregnancy risk among adolescent girls seeking clinic services who are at high risk for pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sexual risk behaviors and related outcomes with a 24-month postbaseline survey, 6 months after the conclusion of the Prime Time intervention. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Community and school-based primary care clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Of 253 sexually active 13- to 17-year-old girls meeting specified risk criteria, 236 (93.3%) completed the 24-month follow-up survey. INTERVENTION: Offered during an 18-month period, Prime Time includes case management and youth leadership programs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported consistency of condom, hormonal, and dual-method contraceptive use with most recent male sex partner and number of male sex partners in the past 6 months. RESULTS: At 24-month follow-up, the intervention group reported significantly more consistent use of condoms, hormonal contraception, and dual-method contraception than the control group. Intervention participants also reported improvements in family connectedness and self-efficacy to refuse unwanted sex, and reductions in the perceived importance of having sex. No between-group differences were found in the number of recent male sex partners. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study contributes to what has been a dearth of evidence regarding youth development interventions offered through clinic settings, where access to high-risk adolescents is plentiful but few efforts have emphasized a dual approach of strengthening sexual and nonsexual protective factors while addressing risk. Findings suggest that health services grounded in a youth development framework can lead to long-term reductions in sexual risk among vulnerable youth.",Adolescent Female Humans Intention to Treat Analysis Leadership Peer Group Pregnancy Pregnancy in Adolescence/*prevention & control Risk-Taking Sexual Behavior Trust

In this BTBI, an ""encoder"" rat performed sensorimotor tasks that required it to select from two choices of tactile or visual stimuli. While the encoder rat performed the task, samples of its cortical activity were transmitted to matching cortical areas of a ""decoder"" rat using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS). The decoder rat learned to make similar behavioral selections, guided solely by the information provided by the encoder rat's brain. These results demonstrated that a complex system was formed by coupling the animals' brains, suggesting that BTBIs can enable dyads or networks of animal's brains to exchange, process, and store information and, hence, serve as the basis for studies of novel types of social interaction and for biological computing devices.","Animals Behavior, Animal/physiology Brain/*physiology Electric Stimulation Microelectrodes Motor Cortex/*physiology Rats Rats, Long-Evans"

The purpose of this study is to assess the self-reported nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among Head Start teachers from one urban Head Start organization in Harris County, TX. A cross-sectional, descriptive analysis was conducted using baseline surveys in the 2008-2009 school year. One hundred eighty-one Head Start teachers completed self-reported surveys of their nutrition knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, weight status, and other weight-related behaviors. The sample was predominantly female (97%) and minority (93%); 24% were overweight and 55% were obese. One fourth of the sample did not consume fruit (26%) or vegetables (23%) the previous day. Half of the teachers reported consuming french fries (52%) and soda (44%), and one fourth consumed fried meat (28%) at least once on the previous day. Only four teachers (3%) answered at least four of the five nutrition knowledge questions correctly. Half of the teachers (54%) agreed that it was hard to know which nutrition information to believe, and only 9% reported that their nutrition habits were healthy. A majority of teachers were trying to lose weight (71%) and said they would like to weigh less (81%). This study underscores the importance of providing nutrition education and wellness opportunities to Head Start teachers to better enable them to teach nutrition education to their students and to improve their own health.","Adult Cross-Sectional Studies Diet/*statistics & numerical data Early Intervention (Education) Faculty/*statistics & numerical data Female *Health Behavior *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Humans Male Middle Aged Minority Groups/statistics & numerical data Nutritional Sciences/education Obesity/epidemiology Overweight/*epidemiology Questionnaires Texas/epidemiology Young Adult"
23439904,Screening for hypertension in children and adolescents to prevent cardiovascular disease.,Pediatrics,Thompson M and Dana T and Bougatsos C and Blazina I and Norris SL,Missing,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of hypertension is increasing in children, and may persist into adulthood. This systematic review was conducted for the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation on the effectiveness of screening asymptomatic children and adolescents for hypertension in order to prevent cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified from Medline and the Cochrane Library (through July 2012). We included trials and controlled observational studies in asymptomatic children and adolescents on the effectiveness and harms of screening and treatment, as well as accuracy of blood pressure measurement. One author extracted study characteristics and results, which were checked for accuracy by a second author. RESULTS: No studies evaluated the effects of screening for hypertension on health outcomes. Two studies of screening tests for elevated blood pressure reported moderate sensitivities (0.65, 0.72) and specificities (0.75, 0.92). Sensitivities and specificities of child hypertension for the later presence of adult hypertension (7 studies) were wide ranging (0-0.63 and 0.77-1.0, respectively), and associations between child hypertension and carotid intima media thickening and proteinuria in young adults (3 studies) were inconsistent. Seven studies reported that drug interventions effectively lowered blood pressure in adolescents over short follow-up periods. No serious treatment-related adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: There is no direct evidence that screening for hypertension in children and adolescents reduces adverse cardiovascular outcomes in adults. Additional studies are needed to improve diagnosis and risk stratification of children with elevated blood pressure and to quantify risks and benefits of interventions.",Adolescent Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology/*prevention & control Child Clinical Trials as Topic/methods Humans Hypertension/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology Mass Screening/*methods

Previous studies have raised the possibility that glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP-1)-based therapies, including a GLP-1 mimetic (exenatide) and a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (sitagliptin phosphate), may increase the risk of acute pancreatitis. OBJECTIVE: To test whether GLP-1-based therapies such as exenatide and sitagliptin are associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis. We used conditional logistic regression to analyze the data. DESIGN: Population-based case-control study. SETTING: A large administrative database in the United States from February 1, 2005, through December 31, 2008. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 18 to 64 years. We identified 1269 hospitalized cases with acute pancreatitis using a validated algorithm and 1269 control subjects matched for age category, sex, enrollment pattern, and diabetes complications. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hospitalization for acute pancreatitis. RESULTS: The mean age of included individuals was 52 years, and 57.45% were male. Cases were significantly more likely than controls to have hypertriglyceridemia (12.92% vs 8.35%), alcohol use (3.23% vs 0.24%), gallstones (9.06% vs 1.34), tobacco abuse (16.39% vs 5.52%), obesity (19.62% vs 9.77%), biliary and pancreatic cancer (2.84% vs 0%), cystic fibrosis (0.79% vs 0%), and any neoplasm (29.94% vs 18.05%). After adjusting for available confounders and metformin hydrochloride use, current use of GLP-1-based therapies within 30 days (adjusted odds ratio, 2.24 [95% CI, 1.36-3.68]) and recent use past 30 days and less than 2 years (2.01 [1.37-3.18]) were associated with significantly increased odds of acute pancreatitis relative to the odds in nonusers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this administrative database study of US adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, treatment with the GLP-1-based therapies sitagliptin and exenatide was associated with increased odds of hospitalization for acute pancreatitis.","Acute Disease Adolescent Adult Case-Control Studies Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors/adverse effects Female Glucagon-Like Peptide 1/*adverse effects *Hospitalization Humans Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Pancreatitis/*chemically induced/therapy Peptides/adverse effects Pyrazines/adverse effects Risk Factors Triazoles/adverse effects Venoms/adverse effects"
23439759,Effects of melatonin on appetite and other symptoms in patients with advanced cancer and cachexia: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial.,J Clin Oncol,Del Fabbro E and Dev R and Hui D and Palmer L and Bruera E,Missing,"PURPOSE: Prior studies have suggested that melatonin, a frequently used integrative medicine, can attenuate weight loss, anorexia, and fatigue in patients with cancer. These studies were limited by a lack of blinding and absence of placebo controls. The primary purpose of this study was to compare melatonin with placebo for appetite improvement in patients with cancer cachexia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, 28-day trial of melatonin 20 mg versus placebo in patients with advanced lung or GI cancer, appetite scores >/= 4 on a 0 to 10 scale (10 = worst appetite), and history of weight loss >/= 5%. Assessments included weight, symptoms by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, and quality of life by the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy (FAACT) questionnaire. Differences between groups from baseline to day 28 were analyzed using one-sided, two-sample t tests or Wilcoxon two-sample tests. Interim analysis halfway through the trial had a Lan-DeMets monitoring boundary with an O'Brien-Fleming stopping rule. Decision boundaries were to accept the null hypothesis of futility if the test statistic z < 0.39 (P >/= .348) and reject the null hypothesis if z > 2.54 (P </= .0056). RESULTS: After interim analysis of 48 patients, the study was closed for futility. There were no significant differences between groups for appetite (P = .78) or other symptoms, weight (P = .17), FAACT score (P = .95), toxicity, or survival from baseline to day 28. CONCLUSION: In cachectic patients with advanced cancer, oral melatonin 20 mg at night did not improve appetite, weight, or quality of life compared with placebo.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antioxidants/adverse effects/therapeutic use Appetite/*drug effects Body Weight/drug effects Cachexia/complications/*drug therapy Depression/chemically induced Double-Blind Method Fatigue/chemically induced Female Humans Male Melatonin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Middle Aged Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy Quality of Life Questionnaires Survival Analysis Time Factors Treatment Outcome"

STUDY DESIGN: Children aged 6-12 years were randomized to control (n = 138 from 106 families) or intervention arm (n = 147 from 106 families). The intervention included incentives for meeting step targets as measured by pedometers and structured weekend outdoor activities. Outcomes included trends in activity for the intervention group and between-group differences in pedometer steps, 6-minute walk test, body mass index, and parent-reported Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. RESULTS: At follow-up, children in the intervention group recorded significantly more pedometer steps than controls over the entire week (8660 vs 7767; P = .010), on weekdays (8646 vs 7826; P = .041), and on weekends (8779 vs 7684; P = .018). Three different trajectory classes were identified. The first group increased activity but was not sustained, the second group met the target step levels, and the third group significantly surpassed the step goals. The intervention group showed trends toward longer 6-minute walk test times and higher Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory scores, but the differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Incentives for increased step activity were effective in producing greater steps and showed a (nonsignificant) trend toward improvements in other health outcomes. Thus, future incentive trials should be incorporate greater step targets and longer follow-up periods to provide evidence of the long-term effect of these incentives on children's health.",Child Cluster Analysis *Exercise Female Humans Male *Motivation Motor Activity *Physical Fitness

We conducted a case-control study nested within the prospective Nurses' Health Study II (1991-2001). Participants were free from PMS at baseline. After 10 years, 1,057 women were confirmed as PMS cases and 1,968 as controls. Mineral intake was assessed using food frequency questionnaires completed in 1991, 1995, and 1999. After adjustment for calcium intake and other factors, women in the highest quintile of nonheme iron intake had a relative risk of PMS of 0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44, 0.92; P for trend = 0.04) compared with women in the lowest quintile. Women in the highest quintile of potassium intake had a relative risk of 1.46 (95% CI: 0.99, 2.15; P for trend = 0.04) compared with women in the lowest quintile. High intake of zinc from supplements was marginally associated with PMS (for intake of >/=25 mg/day vs. none, relative risk = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.46, 1.02; P for trend = 0.05). Intakes of sodium, magnesium, and manganese were unrelated to PMS risk. These findings suggest that dietary minerals may be useful in preventing PMS.

Several policy initiatives and structural reforms of the health system have been undertaken. Health expenditure has increased substantially since 1990, albeit from relatively low levels compared with other countries. We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) to examine the patterns of health loss in the UK, the leading preventable risks that explain some of these patterns, and how UK outcomes compare with a set of comparable countries in the European Union and elsewhere in 1990 and 2010. METHODS: We used results of GBD 2010 for 1990 and 2010 for the UK and 18 other comparator nations (the original 15 members of the European Union, Australia, Canada, Norway, and the USA; henceforth EU15+). We present analyses of trends and relative performance for mortality, causes of death, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We present results for 259 diseases and injuries and for 67 risk factors or clusters of risk factors relevant to the UK. We assessed the UK's rank for age-standardised YLLs and DALYs for their leading causes compared with EU15+ in 1990 and 2010. We estimated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all measures. FINDINGS: For both mortality and disability, overall health has improved substantially in absolute terms in the UK from 1990 to 2010. Life expectancy in the UK increased by 4.2 years (95% UI 4.2-4.3) from 1990 to 2010. However, the UK performed significantly worse than the EU15+ for age-standardised death rates, age-standardised YLL rates, and life expectancy in 1990, and its relative position had worsened by 2010. Although in most age groups, there have been reductions in age-specific mortality, for men aged 30-34 years, mortality rates have hardly changed (reduction of 3.7%, 95% UI 2.7-4.9). In terms of premature mortality, worsening ranks are most notable for men and women aged 20-54 years. For all age groups, the contributions of Alzheimer's disease (increase of 137%, 16-277), cirrhosis (65%, ?15 to 107), and drug use disorders (577%, 71-942) to premature mortality rose from 1990 to 2010. In 2010, compared with EU15+, the UK had significantly lower rates of age-standardised YLLs for road injury, diabetes, liver cancer, and chronic kidney disease, but significantly greater rates for ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, breast cancer, other cardiovascular and circulatory disorders, oesophageal cancer, preterm birth complications, congenital anomalies, and aortic aneurysm. Because YLDs per person by age and sex have not changed substantially from 1990 to 2010 but age-specific mortality has been falling, the importance of chronic disability is rising. The major causes of YLDs in 2010 were mental and behavioural disorders (including substance abuse; 21.5% [95 UI 17.2-26.3] of YLDs), and musculoskeletal disorders (30.5% [25.5-35.7]). The leading risk factor in the UK was tobacco (11.8% [10.5-13.3] of DALYs), followed by increased blood pressure (9.0 % [7.5-10.5]), and high body-mass index (8.6% [7.4-9.8]). Diet and physical inactivity accounted for 14.3% (95% UI 12.8-15.9) of UK DALYs in 2010. INTERPRETATION: The performance of the UK in terms of premature mortality is persistently and significantly below the mean of EU15+ and requires additional concerted action. Further progress in premature mortality from several major causes, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers, will probably require improved public health, prevention, early intervention, and treatment activities. The growing burden of disability, particularly from mental disorders, substance use, musculoskeletal disorders, and falls deserves an integrated and strategic response.

23433765,Relation between optimism and lipids in midlife.,Am J Cardiol,Boehm JK and Williams DR and Rimm EB and Ryff C and Kubzansky LD,harvard,"The present research examined optimism's relation with total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. The hypothesis that optimism is associated with a healthier lipid profile was tested. The participants were 990 mostly white men and women from the Midlife in the United States study, who were, on average, 55.1 years old. Optimism was assessed by self-report using the Life Orientation Test. A fasting blood sample was used to assess the serum lipid levels. Linear and logistic regression models examined the cross-sectional association between optimism and lipid levels, accounting for covariates such as demographic characteristics (e.g., education) and health status (e.g., chronic medical conditions). After adjusting for covariates, the results suggested that greater optimism was associated with greater high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower triglycerides. Optimism was not associated with low-density lipoprotein or total cholesterol. The findings were robust to a variety of modeling strategies that considered the effect of treatment of cholesterol problems. The results also indicated that diet and body mass index might link optimism with lipids. In conclusion, this is the first study to suggest that optimism is associated with a healthy lipid profile; moreover, these associations can be explained, in part, by the presence of healthier behaviors and a lower body mass index.",Adult Affect/*physiology Age Factors Aged Aging/*blood Body Mass Index Cross-Sectional Studies Dyslipidemias/*blood/epidemiology Female Humans Incidence Lipids/*blood Male Middle Aged Retrospective Studies Risk Factors United States/epidemiology

Without demographically and behaviorally similar uninfected comparators and without uniformly measured clinical data on risk factors and fatal and nonfatal AMI events, any potential association between HIV status and AMI may be confounded. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether HIV is associated with an increased risk of AMI after adjustment for all standard Framingham risk factors among a large cohort of HIV-positive and demographically and behaviorally similar (ie, similar prevalence of smoking, alcohol, and cocaine use) uninfected veterans in care. DESIGN AND SETTING: Participants in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study Virtual Cohort from April 1, 2003, through December 31, 2009. PARTICIPANTS: After eliminating those with baseline cardiovascular disease, we analyzed data on HIV status, age, sex, race/ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, smoking, hepatitis C infection, body mass index, renal disease, anemia, substance use, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA, antiretroviral therapy, and incidence of AMI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Acute myocardial infarction. RESULTS: We analyzed data on 82 459 participants. During a median follow-up of 5.9 years, there were 871 AMI events. Across 3 decades of age, the mean (95% CI) AMI events per 1000 person-years was consistently and significantly higher for HIV-positive compared with uninfected veterans: for those aged 40 to 49 years, 2.0 (1.6-2.4) vs 1.5 (1.3-1.7); for those aged 50 to 59 years, 3.9 (3.3-4.5) vs 2.2 (1.9-2.5); and for those aged 60 to 69 years, 5.0 (3.8-6.7) vs 3.3 (2.6-4.2) (P < .05 for all). After adjusting for Framingham risk factors, comorbidities, and substance use, HIV-positive veterans had an increased risk of incident AMI compared with uninfected veterans (hazard ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.27-1.72). An excess risk remained among those achieving an HIV-1 RNA level less than 500 copies/mL compared with uninfected veterans in time-updated analyses (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.17-1.66).

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a case-crossover study to estimate the association between nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug use (zolpidem tartrate, eszopiclone, or zaleplon) and the risk for hip fracture among a nationwide sample of long-stay nursing home residents, overall and stratified by individual and facility-level characteristics. DESIGN AND SETTING: Case-crossover study performed in an academic research setting. PARTICIPANTS: The study participants included 15,528 long-stay US nursing home residents 50 years or older with a hip fracture documented in Medicare Part A and Part D fee-for-service claims between July 1, 2007, and December 31, 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios (ORs) of hip fracture were estimated using conditional logistic regression models by comparing the exposure to nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs during the 0 to 29 days before the hip fracture (hazard period) with the exposure during the 60 to 89 and 120 to 149 days before the hip fracture (control periods). Analyses were stratified by individual and facility-level characteristics. RESULTS: Among the study participants, 1715 (11.0%) were dispensed a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug before the hip fracture, with 927 exposure-discordant pairs included in the analyses. The mean (SD) age of participants was 81.0 (9.7) years, and 77.6% were female. The risk for hip fracture was elevated among users of a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.45-1.90). The association between nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug use and hip fracture was somes greater in new users (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.76-2.74) and in residents with mild vs moderate to severe impairment in cognition (OR, 1.86 vs 1.43; P = .06), with moderate vs total or severe functional impairment (OR, 1.71 vs 1.16; P = .11), with limited vs full assistance required with transfers (OR, 2.02 vs 1.43; P = .02), or in a facility with fewer Medicaid beds (OR, 1.90 vs 1.46; P = .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The risk for hip fracture is elevated among nursing home residents using a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug. New users and residents having mild to moderate cognitive impairment or requiring limited assistance with transfers may be most vulnerable to the use of these drugs. Caution should be exercised when prescribing sleep medications to nursing home residents.","Administration, Oral Aged Aged, 80 and over Cross-Over Studies Drug Prescriptions/*statistics & numerical data Female Hip Fractures/*epidemiology/*etiology Humans Hypnotics and Sedatives/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects Logistic Models Male Medicare Middle Aged Mild Cognitive Impairment/complications Moving and Lifting Patients/adverse effects Nursing Homes/*statistics & numerical data Odds Ratio United States/epidemiology"

BACKGROUND: Heart failure hospital stay rates, LOS, and mortality have fallen over the past decade for older Medicare beneficiaries, but whether this holds true for younger adults is unknown. METHODS: From the National Inpatient Sample, we calculated HF hospital stay rates, LOS, and in-hospital mortality from 2001 to 2009 with survey data analysis techniques. RESULTS: Hospital stays (n = 1,686,089) with a primary discharge diagnosis of HF were identified from National Inpatient Sample data between 2001 and 2009. The overall national hospital stay rate decreased from 633 to 463 hospital stays/100,000 persons, (-26.9%, p-for-trend <0.001). However, statistically significant declines (p < 0.001) were only observed for patients 55 to 64 years of age (-36.5%) 65 to 74 years (-37.4%), and >/= 75 years (-28.3%) but not for patients 18 to 44 years of age (-12.8%, p = 0.57) or 45 to 55 years (-16.2%, p = 0.04). Statistically significant declines in LOS were only observed for patients 65 years of age and older. Overall in-hospital mortality fell from 4.5% to 3.3%, a relative decline of -27.4%, (p-for-trend <0.001), but patients 18 to 44 years of age did not exhibit a significant decline (-8.1%, p-for-trend = 0.18). In secondary analyses significant declines in HF hospital stay rate over time were observed for white men, white women, and black women but not for black men (-9.5%, p-for-trend = 0.43). CONCLUSIONS: Younger patients have not experienced comparable declines in HF hospital stay, LOS, and in-hospital mortality as older patients.

Recent studies that reconstructed regulatory networks in mammalian cells have focused on short-term responses and relied on perturbation-based approaches that cannot be readily applied to primary T cells. Here we combine transcriptional profiling at high temporal resolution, novel computational algorithms, and innovative nanowire-based perturbation tools to systematically derive and experimentally validate a model of the dynamic regulatory network that controls the differentiation of mouse TH17 cells, a proinflammatory T-cell subset that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases. The TH17 transcriptional network consists of two self-reinforcing, but mutually antagonistic, modules, with 12 novel regulators, the coupled action of which may be essential for maintaining the balance between TH17 and other CD4(+) T-cell subsets. Our study identifies and validates 39 regulatory factors, embeds them within a comprehensive temporal network and reveals its organizational principles; it also highlights novel drug targets for controlling TH17 cell differentiation.","Animals Antigens, CD95/metabolism Cell Differentiation/*genetics Cells, Cultured DNA/genetics/metabolism Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism Gene Knockdown Techniques Gene Regulatory Networks/*genetics Genome/genetics Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis Interleukin-2/genetics Mice Mice, Inbred C57BL Nanowires Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism Nuclear Proteins/metabolism RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism Reproducibility of Results Silicon Th17 Cells/*cytology/immunology/*metabolism Time Factors Trans-Activators/metabolism Transcription Factors/metabolism Transcription, Genetic/genetics"
23473846,Subcallosal cingulate deep brain stimulation for treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa: a phase 1 pilot trial.,Lancet,Lipsman N and Woodside DB and Giacobbe P and Hamani C and Carter JC and Norwood SJ and Sutandar K and Staab R and Elias G and Lyman CH and Smith GS and Lozano AM,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa is characterised by a chronic course that is refractory to treatment in many patients and has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been applied to circuit-based neuropsychiatric diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and major depression, with promising results. We aimed to assess the safety of DBS to modulate the activity of limbic circuits and to examine how this might affect the clinical features of anorexia nervosa. METHODS: We did a phase 1, prospective trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS in six patients with chronic, severe, and treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa. Eligible patients were aged 20-60 years, had been diagnosed with restricting or binge-purging anorexia nervosa, and showed evidence of chronicity or treatment resistance. Patients underwent medical optimisation preoperatively and had baseline body-mass index (BMI), psychometric, and neuroimaging investigations, followed by implantation of electrodes and pulse generators for continuous delivery of electrical stimulation. Patients were followed up for 9 months after DBS activation, and the primary outcome of adverse events associated with surgery or stimulation was monitored at every follow-up visit. Repeat psychometric assessments, BMI measurements, and neuroimaging investigations were also done at various intervals. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01476540. FINDINGS: DBS was associated with several adverse events, only one of which (seizure during programming, roughly 2 weeks after surgery) was serious. Other related adverse events were panic attack during surgery, nausea, air embolus, and pain. After 9 months, three of the six patients had achieved and maintained a BMI greater than their historical baselines. DBS was associated with improvements in mood, anxiety, affective regulation, and anorexia nervosa-related obsessions and compulsions in four patients and with improvements in quality of life in three patients after 6 months of stimulation. These clinical benefits were accompanied by changes in cerebral glucose metabolism (seen in a comparison of composite PET scans at baseline and 6 months) that were consistent with a reversal of the abnormalities seen in the anterior cingulate, insula, and parietal lobe in the disorder. INTERPRETATION: Subcallosal cingulate DBS seems to be generally safe in this sample of patients with chronic and treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa.

23439620,The effect of socioeconomic status on access to primary care: an audit study.,CMAJ,Olah ME and Gaisano G and Hwang SW,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Health care office staff and providers may discriminate against people of low socioeconomic status, even in the absence of economic incentives to do so. We sought to determine whether socioeconomic status affects the response a patient receives when seeking a primary care appointment. METHODS: In a single unannounced telephone call to a random sample of family physicians and general practices (n = 375) in Toronto, Ontario, a male and a female researcher each played the role of a patient seeking a primary care physician. Callers followed a script suggesting either high (i.e., bank employee transferred to the city) or low (i.e., recipient of social assistance) socioeconomic status, and either the presence or absence of chronic health conditions (diabetes and low back pain). We randomized the characteristics of the caller for each office. Our primary outcome was whether the caller was offered an appointment. RESULTS: The proportion of calls resulting in an appointment being offered was significantly higher when the callers presented themselves as having high socioeconomic status than when they presented as having low socioeconomic status (22.6% v.14.3%, p = 0.04) and when the callers stated the presence of chronic health conditions than when they did not (23.5% v. 12.8%, p = 0.008). In a model adjusted for all independent variables significant at a p value of 0.10 or less (presence of chronic health conditions, time since graduation from medical school and membership in the College of Family Physicians of Canada), high socioeconomic status was associated with an odds ratio of 1.78 (95% confidence interval 1.02-3.08) for the offer of an appointment. Socioeconomic status and chronic health conditions had independent effects on the likelihood of obtaining an appointment. INTERPRETATION: Within a universal health insurance system in which physician reimbursement is unaffected by patients' socioeconomic status, people presenting themselves as having high socioeconomic status received preferential access to primary care over those presenting themselves as having low socioeconomic status.",Canada Female *Health Services Accessibility/economics/statistics & numerical data Health Services Research Humans Logistic Models Male *Primary Health Care/economics *Social Class *Social Discrimination/economics/statistics & numerical data
23439902,Associations of food stamp participation with dietary quality and obesity in children.,Pediatrics,Leung CW and Blumenthal SJ and Hoffnagle EE and Jensen HH and Foerster SB and Nestle M and Cheung LW and Mozaffarian D and Willett WC,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if obesity and dietary quality in low-income children differed by participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly the Food Stamp Program. METHODS: The study population included 5193 children aged 4 to 19 with household incomes </=130% of the federal poverty level from the 1999-2008 NHANES. Diet was measured by using 24-hour recalls. RESULTS: Among low-income US children, 28% resided in households currently receiving SNAP benefits. After adjusting for sociodemographic differences, SNAP participation was not associated with a higher rate of childhood obesity (odds ratio = 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-1.74). Both SNAP participants and low-income nonparticipants were below national recommendations for whole grains, fruits, vegetables, fish, and potassium, while exceeding recommended limits for processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, saturated fat, and sodium. Zero percent of low-income children met at least 7 of 10 dietary recommendations. After multivariate adjustment, compared with nonparticipants, SNAP participants consumed 43% more sugar-sweetened beverages (95% CI: 8%-89%), 47% more high-fat dairy (95% CI: 7%, 101%), and 44% more processed meats (95% CI: 9%-91%), but 19% fewer nuts, seeds, and legumes (95% CI: -35% to 0%). In part due to these differences, intakes of calcium, iron, and folate were significantly higher among SNAP participants. Significant differences by SNAP participation were not evident in total energy, macronutrients, Healthy Eating Index 2005 scores, or Alternate Healthy Eating Index scores. CONCLUSIONS: The diets of low-income children are far from meeting national dietary recommendations. Policy changes should be considered to restructure SNAP to improve children's health.","Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Diet/economics/standards/*trends Female Food Assistance/economics/*trends Humans Male Nutrition Surveys/methods/*trends *Nutritive Value Obesity/economics/*epidemiology Poverty/economics/*trends Young Adult"
23439323,Perinatal implications of motor vehicle accident trauma during pregnancy: identifying populations at risk.,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Luley T and Fitzpatrick CB and Grotegut CA and Hocker MB and Myers ER and Brown HL,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between restraint use, race, and perinatal outcome after motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) during pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: The Duke Trauma Registry and medical records were searched for information on pregnant women at >14 weeks' gestation who were involved in an MVA and who received care through the Emergency Department and the Obstetric Units. Between January 1994 and December 31, 2010, 126 women were identified. Variables that were collected included type of trauma, gestational age at presentation, and delivery outcomes. A prognostic study was performed that evaluated the associations between maternal demographics, details of the accident that included restraint use, and maternal treatment that was related to the accident in relationship to perinatal outcome. RESULTS: There was no difference in the mean age or median gravidity or parity by race among pregnant women who were cared for after an MVA. There was no difference in mean age or racial distribution between women who were restrained compared with women who were unrestrained; unrestrained women were more likely to be nulliparous. Unrestrained women were more likely to require nonobstetric surgery that was related to the trauma. The overall rate of placental abruption was 6%. There were 6 intrauterine fetal deaths, 3 each in the unrestrained (25%) and restrained groups (3.5%; P = .018). Airbags deployed in 17 accidents. Among the 7 women with placenta abruption, 4 women (57%) experienced air bag deployment. CONCLUSION: Lack of restraint use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of fetal death.","Abruptio Placentae/epidemiology/ethnology/etiology Accidents, Traffic/*statistics & numerical data Adolescent Adult Air Bags/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data Continental Population Groups Female Fetal Death/epidemiology/ethnology/etiology Humans Medical Records Motor Vehicles Pregnancy *Pregnancy Complications Pregnancy Outcome Registries Risk Factors Seat Belts/*utilization Wounds and Injuries/complications/*epidemiology/ethnology Young Adult"
23467813,Randomized multicenter investigation of folate plus vitamin B12 supplementation in schizophrenia.,JAMA Psychiatry,Roffman JL and Lamberti JS and Achtyes E and Macklin EA and Galendez GC and Raeke LH and Silverstein NJ and Smoller JW and Hill M and Goff DC,partners,"IMPORTANCE: More effective treatments are needed for negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which are typically chronic, disabling, and costly. Negative symptoms have previously been associated with reduced blood folate levels, especially among patients with low-functioning variants in genes that regulate folate metabolism, suggesting the potential utility of folate supplementation. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether folic acid plus vitamin B12 supplementation reduces negative symptoms of schizophrenia and whether functional variants in folate-related genes influence treatment response. DESIGN: Parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 16 weeks of treatment with 2 mg of folic acid and 400 mug of vitamin B12. SETTING: Three community mental health centers affiliated with academic medical centers in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Outpatients with chronic schizophrenia who were psychiatrically stable but displayed persistent symptoms despite antipsychotic treatment. Eligible patients were 18 to 68 years old, were treated with an antipsychotic agent for 6 months or more at a stable dose for 6 weeks or more, and scored 60 or more on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. INTERVENTION: One hundred forty subjects were randomized to receive daily oral folic acid plus vitamin B12 or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in negative symptoms (Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms [SANS]), as well as positive and total symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale). RESULTS: Folate plus vitamin B12 improved negative symptoms significantly compared with placebo (group difference, -0.33 change in SANS score per week; 95% CI, -0.62 to -0.05) when genotype was taken into account but not when genotype was excluded. An interaction of the 484C>T variant of FOLH1 (rs202676) with treatment was observed (P = .02), where only patients homozygous for the 484T allele demonstrated significantly greater benefit with active treatment (-0.59 change in SANS score per week; 95% CI, -0.99 to -0.18). In parallel, we observed an inverse relationship between red blood cell folate concentration at baseline and 484C allele load (P = .03), which persisted until 8 weeks of treatment. Change in positive and total symptoms did not differ between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Folate plus vitamin B12 supplementation can improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but treatment response is influenced by genetic variation in folate absorption. These findings support a personalized medicine approach for the treatment of negative symptoms.

The results of randomized supplementation trials using various n-3 LCPUFA sources and amounts are mixed. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that 600 mg/d of the n-3 LCPUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can increase maternal and newborn DHA status, gestation duration, birth weight, and length. Safety was assessed. DESIGN: This phase III, double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted between January 2006 and October 2011. Women (n = 350) consumed capsules (placebo, DHA) from <20 wk of gestation to birth. Blood (enrollment, birth, and cord) was analyzed for red blood cell (RBC) phospholipid DHA. The statistical analysis was intent-to-treat. RESULTS: Most of the capsules were consumed (76% placebo; 78% DHA); the mean DHA intake for the treated group was 469 mg/d. In comparison with placebo, DHA supplementation resulted in higher maternal and cord RBC-phospholipid-DHA (2.6%; P < 0.001), longer gestation duration (2.9 d; P = 0.041), and greater birth weight (172 g; P = 0.004), length (0.7 cm; P = 0.022), and head circumference (0.5 cm; P = 0.012). In addition, the DHA group had fewer infants born at <34 wk of gestation (P = 0.025) and shorter hospital stays for infants born preterm (40.8 compared with 8.9 d; P = 0.026) than did the placebo group. No safety concerns were identified. CONCLUSIONS: A supplement of 600 mg DHA/d in the last half of gestation resulted in overall greater gestation duration and infant size. A reduction in early preterm and very-low birth weight could be important clinical and public health outcomes of DHA supplementation.

However, SARS coronavirus caused severe lower respiratory disease with nearly 10% mortality and evidence of systemic spread. Recently, another coronavirus (human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center (hCoV-EMC)) was identified in patients with severe and sometimes lethal lower respiratory tract infection. Viral genome analysis revealed close relatedness to coronaviruses found in bats. Here we identify dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) as a functional receptor for hCoV-EMC. DPP4 specifically co-purified with the receptor-binding S1 domain of the hCoV-EMC spike protein from lysates of susceptible Huh-7 cells. Antibodies directed against DPP4 inhibited hCoV-EMC infection of primary human bronchial epithelial cells and Huh-7 cells. Expression of human and bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) DPP4 in non-susceptible COS-7 cells enabled infection by hCoV-EMC. The use of the evolutionarily conserved DPP4 protein from different species as a functional receptor provides clues about the host range potential of hCoV-EMC. In addition, it will contribute critically to our understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this emerging human coronavirus, and may facilitate the development of intervention strategies.","Animals Bronchioles/cytology COS Cells Cercopithecus aethiops Chiroptera Coronavirus/*classification/*metabolism Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology/genetics/metabolism/virology Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/genetics/*metabolism Epithelial Cells/virology Host Specificity Humans Molecular Sequence Data Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism"

METHODS: All women who birthed in Queensland, Australia, from February 1 to May 31, 2010, received a survey 4 months postpartum. Maternal, infant, and hospital characteristics; pregnancy and birth complications; and infant feeding outcomes were measured. RESULTS: Sample size was 6752 women. Breastfeeding initiation rates were high (96%) and similar in BFHI-accredited and nonaccredited hospitals. After adjustment for significant maternal, infant, clinical, and hospital variables, women who birthed in BFHI-accredited hospitals had significantly lower odds of breastfeeding at 1 month (adjusted odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.58-0.90) than those who birthed in non-BFHI-accredited hospitals. BFHI accreditation did not affect the odds of breastfeeding at 4 months or exclusive breastfeeding at 1 or 4 months. Four in-hospital practices (early skin-to-skin contact, attempted breastfeeding within the first hour, rooming-in, and no in-hospital supplementation) were experienced by 70% to 80% of mothers, with 50.3% experiencing all 4. Women who experienced all 4 hospital practices had higher odds of breastfeeding at 1 month (adjusted odds ratio 2.20, 95% confidence interval 1.78-2.71) and 4 months (adjusted odds ratio 2.93, 95% confidence interval 2.40-3.60) than women who experienced fewer than 4. CONCLUSIONS: When breastfeeding-initiation rates are high and evidence-based practices that support breastfeeding are common within the hospital environment, BFHI accreditation per se has little effect on both exclusive or any breastfeeding rates.","*Accreditation Adult Breast Feeding/*statistics & numerical data Cohort Studies Female Health Care Surveys Health Surveys Hospitals/*standards/statistics & numerical data Humans Infant Infant Care/*standards/statistics & numerical data Infant, Newborn Logistic Models Multivariate Analysis Postnatal Care/*standards/statistics & numerical data Queensland Retrospective Studies"

However, the impact of NSAIDs on the risk of melanoma has been inconsistent. The authors evaluated the association between NSAID use and cutaneous melanoma risk in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study (OS). METHODS: At study entry, use of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) and nonaspirin NSAIDs was assessed among 59,806 postmenopausal Caucasian women ages 50 to 79 years. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed after adjusting for participant skin type, sun exposure history, and medical indications for NSAID use among other confounders. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12 years, 548 incident melanomas were confirmed by medical review. Women who used ASA had a 21% lower risk of melanoma (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.98) relative to nonusers. Increased duration of ASA use (<1 year, 1-4 years, and >/= 5 years) was associated with an 11% lower risk of melanoma for each categorical increase (Ptrend = .01), and women with >/= 5 years of use had a 30% lower melanoma risk (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.94). In contrast, use of non-ASA NSAIDs and acetaminophen were not associated with melanoma risk. CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal women who used ASA had a significantly lower risk of melanoma, and longer duration of ASA use was associated with greater protection. Although this study was limited by the observational design and self-report of NSAID use, the findings suggest that ASA may have a chemopreventive effect against the development of melanoma and warrant further clinical investigation.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*administration & dosage Aspirin/*administration & dosage Cohort Studies European Continental Ancestry Group/*statistics & numerical data Female Humans Incidence Melanoma/*epidemiology/ethnology/prevention & control Middle Aged Postmenopause Proportional Hazards Models Risk Factors Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology/ethnology/prevention & control United States/epidemiology"

We evaluated associations between high- and low-fat dairy intake, recurrence, and mortality after breast cancer diagnosis. METHODS: We included 1893 women from the Life After Cancer Epidemiology study diagnosed with early-stage invasive breast cancer from 1997 to 2000, who completed the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Food Frequency Questionnaire after diagnosis. A total of 349 women had a recurrence and 372 died during a median follow-up of 11.8 years, with 189 deaths from breast cancer. We used delayed entry Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate associations between categories of the cumulative average of dairy fat at baseline and at follow-up 5 to 6 years later and subsequent outcomes. Tests of statistical significance were two-sided. RESULTS: In multivariable-adjusted analyses, overall dairy intake was unrelated to breast cancer-specific outcomes, although it was positively related to overall mortality. Low-fat dairy intake was unrelated to recurrence or survival. However, high-fat dairy intake was positively associated with outcomes. Compared with the reference (0 to <0.5 servings/day), those consuming larger amounts of high-fat dairy had higher breast cancer mortality (0.5 to <1.0 servings/day: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.82 to 1.77; and >/=1.0 servings/day: HR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.00 to 2.24, P trend = .05), higher all-cause mortality (P trend < .001), and higher non-breast cancer mortality (P trend = .007); the relationship with breast cancer recurrence was positive but not statistically significant.

Given the difficulty of eradicating HIV-1, a functional cure for HIV-infected patients appears to be a more reachable short-term goal. We identified 14 HIV patients (post-treatment controllers [PTCs]) whose viremia remained controlled for several years after the interruption of prolonged cART initiated during the primary infection. Most PTCs lacked the protective HLA B alleles that are overrepresented in spontaneous HIV controllers (HICs); instead, they carried risk-associated HLA alleles that were largely absent among the HICs. Accordingly, the PTCs had poorer CD8+ T cell responses and more severe primary infections than the HICs did. Moreover, the incidence of viral control after the interruption of early antiretroviral therapy was higher among the PTCs than has been reported for spontaneous control. Off therapy, the PTCs were able to maintain and, in some cases, further reduce an extremely low viral reservoir. We found that long-lived HIV-infected CD4+ T cells contributed poorly to the total resting HIV reservoir in the PTCs because of a low rate of infection of naive T cells and a skewed distribution of resting memory CD4+ T cell subsets. Our results show that early and prolonged cART may allow some individuals with a rather unfavorable background to achieve long-term infection control and may have important implications in the search for a functional HIV cure.",Missing

Although the psychological effects of conflict are well documented, the potential legacy of violent offending has yet to be ascertained. We describe our use of criminal records to investigate the effect of deployment, combat, and post-deployment mental health problems on violent offending among military personnel relative to pre-existing risk factors. METHODS: In this cohort study, we linked data from 13,856 randomly selected, serving and ex-serving UK military personnel with national criminal records stored on the Ministry of Justice Police National Computer database. We describe offending during the lifetime of the participants and assess the risk factors for violent offending. FINDINGS: 2,139 (weighted 17.0%) of 12,359 male UK military personnel had a criminal record for any offence during their lifetime. Violent offenders (1,369 [11.0%]) were the most prevalent offender types; prevalence was highest in men aged 30 years or younger (521 [20.6%] of 2,728) and fell with age (164 [4.7%] of 3027 at age >45 years). Deployment was not independently associated with increased risk of violent offending, but serving in a combat role conferred an additional risk, even after adjustment for confounders (violent offending in 137 [6.3%] of 2178 men deployed in a combat role vs 140 (2.4%) of 5,797 deployed in a non-combat role; adjusted hazard ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.15-2.03; p=0.003). Increased exposure to traumatic events during deployment also increased risk of violent offending (violent offending in 104 [4.1%] of 2753 men with exposure to two to four traumatic events vs 56 [1.6%] of 2944 with zero to one traumatic event, 1.77, 1.21-2.58, p=0.003; and violent offending in 122 [5.1%] of 2582 men with exposure to five to 16 traumatic events, 1.65, 1.12-2.40, p=0.01; test for trend, p=0.032). Violent offending was strongly associated with post-deployment alcohol misuse (violent offending in 120 [9.0%] of 1363 men with alcohol misuse vs 155 [2.3%] of 6768 with no alcohol misuse; 2.16, 1.62-2.90; p<0.0001), post-traumatic stress disorder (violent offending in 25 [8.6%] of 344 men with post-traumatic stress disorder vs 221 [3.0%] of 7256 with no symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder; 2.20, 1.36-3.55; p=0.001), and high levels of self-reported aggressive behaviour (violent offending in 56 [6.7%] of 856 men with an aggression score of six to 16 vs 22 [1.2%] of 1685 with an aggression score of zero; 2.47, 1.37-4.46; p=0.003). Of the post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, the hyperarousal cluster was most strongly associated with violent offending (2.01, 1.50-2.70; p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Alcohol misuse and aggressive behaviour might be appropriate targets for interventions, but any action must be evidence based. Post-traumatic stress disorder, though less prevalent, is also a risk factor for violence, especially hyperarousal symptoms, so if diagnosed it should be appropriately treated and associated risk monitored.

23446890,Eating attentively: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of food intake memory and awareness on eating.,Am J Clin Nutr,Robinson E and Aveyard P and Daley A and Jolly K and Lewis A and Lycett D and Higgs S,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive processes such as attention and memory may influence food intake, but the degree to which they do is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine whether such cognitive processes influence the amount of food eaten either immediately or in subsequent meals. DESIGN: We systematically reviewed studies that examined experimentally the effect that manipulating memory, distraction, awareness, or attention has on food intake. We combined studies by using inverse variance meta-analysis, calculating the standardized mean difference (SMD) in food intake between experimental and control groups and assessing heterogeneity with the I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were reviewed. Evidence indicated that eating when distracted produced a moderate increase in immediate intake (SMD: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.53) but increased later intake to a greater extent (SMD: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.45, 1.07). The effect of distraction on immediate intake appeared to be independent of dietary restraint. Enhancing memory of food consumed reduced later intake (SMD: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.68), but this effect may depend on the degree of the participants' tendencies toward disinhibited eating. Removing visual information about the amount of food eaten during a meal increased immediate intake (SMD: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.68). Enhancing awareness of food being eaten may not affect immediate intake (SMD: 0.09; 95% CI: -0.42, 0.35). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence indicates that attentive eating is likely to influence food intake, and incorporation of attentive-eating principles into interventions provides a novel approach to aid weight loss and maintenance without the need for conscious calorie counting.",*Attention Awareness Eating/*psychology *Energy Intake Humans Meals Memory
23432436,"Moderate, excessive or heavy alcohol consumption: each is significantly associated with increased mortality in patients with chronic hepatitis C.",Aliment Pharmacol Ther,Younossi ZM and Zheng L and Stepanova M and Venkatesan C and Mir HM,inova,"BACKGROUND: The impact of moderate alcohol consumption on long-term outcomes of chronic hepatitis C (CH-C) infected patients remains controversial. AIM: To assess the impact of moderate alcohol consumption on long-term outcomes of CH-C patients using population-based data. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)-mortality linked files. Alcohol consumption was estimated as grams/day. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was utilized to assess the effects of CH-C and alcohol consumption on mortality (all causes, cardiovascular disease, and liver disease). RESULTS: A total of 8985 participants were included as the study cohort. Of these, 218 had CH-C. The follow-up time was 162.95 months for CH-C and 178.27 months for controls. CH-C patients had increased risk for both overall mortality and liver-related mortality. CH-C patients with excessive alcohol consumption had even higher risks for overall mortality and liver-related mortality. The risk of overall mortality associated with CH-C increased with moderate alcohol consumption of 1-19 g/day and heavy alcohol consumption >/=30 g/day. CONCLUSION: Although chronic hepatitis C is associated with increased risks for overall and liver-related mortality, these risks are even higher for patients consuming moderate and excessive amounts of alcohol.","Adult Aged Alcohol Drinking/adverse effects/*mortality Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality Cause of Death Cohort Studies Female Hepatitis C, Chronic/*mortality Humans Male Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Nutrition Surveys Proportional Hazards Models Questionnaires Risk Factors United States/epidemiology Young Adult"

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 1,296,517 encounters by 208,015 children to 222 clinicians in 25 practices in 2009. Clinical, antibiotic prescribing, and demographic data were obtained from a shared electronic health record. We estimated within-clinician associations between patient race (black versus nonblack) and (1) antibiotic prescribing or (2) acute respiratory tract infection diagnosis after adjusting for potential patient-level confounders. RESULTS: Black children were less likely to receive an antibiotic prescription from the same clinician per acute visit (23.5% vs 29.0%, odds ratio [OR] 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72-0.77) or per population (0.43 vs 0.67 prescriptions/child/year, incidence rate ratio 0.64; 95% CI 0.63-0.66), despite adjustment for age, gender, comorbid conditions, insurance, and stratification by practice. Black children were also less likely to receive diagnoses that justified antibiotic treatment, including acute otitis media (8.7% vs 10.7%, OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.75-0.82), acute sinusitis (3.6% vs 4.4%, OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.73-0.86), and group A streptococcal pharyngitis (2.3% vs 3.7%, OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.55-0.66). When an antibiotic was prescribed, black children were less likely to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics at any visit (34.0% vs 36.9%, OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.82-0.93) and for acute otitis media (31.7% vs 37.8%, OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.68-0.83). CONCLUSIONS: When treated by the same clinician, black children received fewer antibiotic prescriptions, fewer acute respiratory tract infection diagnoses, and a lower proportion of broad-spectrum antibiotic prescriptions than nonblack children.

A critical analysis.,Addiction,Fekjaer HO,Missing,"BACKGROUND: In observational studies, moderate drinking is associated with a reduced risk of more than twenty different diseases and health problems. However, it would be premature to conclude that there is a causal relationship. METHOD: This paper critically reviews the evidence for such associations. FINDINGS: It was found that reasons for questioning the causal association of moderate drinking and a reduced health risk are: the lack of dose-response relationships; the characteristics and lifestyles of today's abstainers and moderate drinkers; the lack of plausible biological mechanisms; the problems in the classification of drinking groups, and; the general limitations of observational studies.

23552572,High variation between hospitals in vena cava filter use for venous thromboembolism.,JAMA Intern Med,White RH and Geraghty EM and Brunson A and Murin S and Wun T and Spencer F and Romano PS,ucdavis,"BACKGROUND: The extent to which vena cava filter (VCF) use varies between hospitals in the management of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) is not clear. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study that compared the frequency of VCF use among California hospitals from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2010. Using administrative hospital discharge data, we followed explicit criteria to identify nontrauma patients with acute VTE, and determined the frequency of VCF placement in each of the hospitals that admitted more than 55 VTE patients. Multivariable hierarchical regression models to predict VCF use included important clinical and demographic variables as fixed effects and hospital as a random effect. RESULTS: Among the 263 hospitals included, 130 643 acute VTE hospitalizations occurred with the placement of 19 537 VCFs (14.95%). Variation in the percentage of acute VTE hospitalizations that included VCF placement was very high, from 0% to 38.96% (interquartile range, 6.23%-18.14%), with 18.49% of the observed variation due to differences among the hospitals that provided care. Significant clinical predictors of VCF use included acute bleeding at the time of admission (odds ratio, 3.4 [95% CI, 3.2-3.6]), a major operation after admission for VTE (3.4 [3.3-3.5]), presence of metastatic cancer (1.7 [1.6-1.8]), and extreme severity of illness (2.5 [2.3-2.7] vs mild). Insertion of VCFs occurred more frequently than expected in 109 hospitals and less frequently in 59. Hospital characteristics associated with VCF use included a small number of beds (odds ratio, 0.2 [95% CI, 0.2-0.4], <100 vs >400 beds), a rural location (0.4 [0.2-0.5]), and other private vs Kaiser hospitals (1.5 [1.1-2.0]). Use of VCFs varied widely even in geographically proximate areas. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of VCF use in patients with acute VTE varied widely and depended on which hospital provided the care, even after adjusting for clinical and socioeconomic factors. Further research is needed to determine whether this variation is associated with local cultural differences between hospitals or with differences in the availability of interventional radiologists or specialists, or whether it reflects the absence of high-quality evidence that VCFs are effective.",California Hospital Records *Hospitals Humans Retrospective Studies Vena Cava Filters/*utilization Venous Thromboembolism/*therapy
23478861,Sentinel injuries in infants evaluated for child physical abuse.,Pediatrics,Sheets LK and Leach ME and Koszewski IJ and Lessmeier AM and Nugent M and Simpson P,chw,"OBJECTIVE: Relatively minor abusive injuries can precede severe physical abuse in infants. Our objective was to determine how often abused infants have a previous history of ""sentinel"" injuries, compared with infants who were not abused. METHODS: Case-control, retrospective study of 401, <12-month-old infants evaluated for abuse in a hospital-based setting and found to have definite, intermediate concern for, or no abuse after evaluation by the hospital-based Child Protection Team. A sentinel injury was defined as a previous injury reported in the medical history that was suspicious for abuse because the infant could not cruise, or the explanation was implausible. RESULTS: Of the 200 definitely abused infants, 27.5% had a previous sentinel injury compared with 8% of the 100 infants with intermediate concern for abuse (odds ratio: 4.4, 95% confidence interval: 2.0-9.6; P < .001). None of the 101 nonabused infants (controls) had a previous sentinel injury (P < .001). The type of sentinel injury in the definitely abused cohort was bruising (80%), intraoral injury (11%), and other injury (7%). Sentinel injuries occurred in early infancy: 66% at <3 months of age and 95% at or before the age of 7 months. Medical providers were reportedly aware of the sentinel injury in 41.9% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Previous sentinel injuries are common in infants with severe physical abuse and rare in infants evaluated for abuse and found to not be abused.

23552850,Influence of race on the management of lower extremity ischemia: revascularization vs amputation.,JAMA Surg,Durazzo TS and Frencher S and Gusberg R,yale,"IMPORTANCE: Among patients presenting with critical lower extremity ischemia, it has been previously documented that white individuals are more likely to undergo revascularization than nonwhite individuals, with the disparity largely attributed to differences in resources and access to care. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the amputation disparity between white and nonwhite patients with critical lower extremity ischemia in more detail using a larger data set than previous studies, with a focus on the role of confounding factors such as access and hospital resources. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: All hospital discharge records from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of adult patients with the primary diagnosis of critical lower extremity ischemia from 2002-2008 were examined in detail using multiple logistic regression (n = 774,399). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of amputation and revascularization for peripheral vascular disease across race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Controlling for confounding factors, black patients were found to have 1.77 times the odds of receiving an amputation compared with white patients (95% CI, 1.72-1.84; P < .001). Further analysis revealed the black to white odds ratio paradoxically increased with increasing revascularization capacity of the presenting hospital, from a low of 1.43 (95% CI, 1.23-1.65) to a high of 1.98 (95% CI, 1.83-2.24). The amputation disparity also paradoxically increased for patients living in wealthier zip codes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Black patients have greater odds of undergoing amputation than white patients, even after correcting for an array of confounding parameters. Contrary to current beliefs that the disparity is mainly secondary to differences in access, this study found that the disparity was magnified in settings where resources were greatest. Whether the explanation lies primarily in patient-specific, physician-specific, or institutional-specific factors remains to be determined but is critical to better understanding our health care system and maintaining approaches that are consistently fair and equitable.",*African Americans Aged Amputation/*statistics & numerical data Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) Female Healthcare Disparities/ethnology Humans Ischemia/*ethnology/*surgery Logistic Models Lower Extremity/*blood supply Male Retrospective Studies Vascular Surgical Procedures/*statistics & numerical data
23553111,Autism risk across generations: a population-based study of advancing grandpaternal and paternal age.,JAMA Psychiatry,Frans EM and Sandin S and Reichenberg A and Langstrom N and Lichtenstein P and McGrath JJ and Hultman CM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Advancing paternal age has been linked to autism. OBJECTIVE: To further expand knowledge about the association between paternal age and autism by studying the effect of grandfathers' age on childhood autism. DESIGN: Population-based, multigenerational, case-control study. SETTING: Nationwide multigeneration and patient registers in Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a study of individuals born in Sweden since 1932. Parental age at birth was obtained for more than 90% of the cohort. Grandparental age at the time of birth of the parent was obtained for a smaller subset (5936 cases and 30 923 controls). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: International Classification of Diseases diagnosis of childhood autism in the patient registry. RESULTS: A statistically significant monotonic association was found between advancing grandpaternal age at the time of birth of the parent and risk of autism in grandchildren. Men who had fathered a daughter when they were 50 years or older were 1.79 times (95% CI, 1.35-2.37; P < .001) more likely to have a grandchild with autism, and men who had fathered a son when they were 50 years or older were 1.67 times (95% CI, 1.35-2.37; P < .001) more likely to have a grandchild with autism, compared with men who had fathered children when they were 20 to 24 years old, after controlling for birth year and sex of the child, age of the spouse, family history of psychiatric disorders, highest family educational level, and residential county. A statistically significant monotonic association was also found between advancing paternal age and risk of autism in the offspring. Sensitivity analyses indicated that these findings were not the result of bias due to missing data on grandparental age. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Advanced grandparental age was associated with increased risk of autism, suggesting that risk of autism could develop over generations.

Only those patients able to achieve a second remission with no minimal residual disease (MRD) have a hope for long-term survival in the context of a subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We have treated five relapsed B-ALL subjects with autologous T cells expressing a CD19-specific CD28/CD3zeta second-generation dual-signaling chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) termed 19-28z. All patients with persistent morphological disease or MRD(+) disease upon T cell infusion demonstrated rapid tumor eradication and achieved MRD(-) complete remissions as assessed by deep sequencing polymerase chain reaction. Therapy was well tolerated, although significant cytokine elevations, specifically observed in those patients with morphologic evidence of disease at the time of treatment, required lymphotoxic steroid therapy to ameliorate cytokine-mediated toxicities. Indeed, cytokine elevations directly correlated to tumor burden at the time of CAR-modified T cell infusions. Tumor cells from one patient with relapsed disease after CAR-modified T cell therapy, who was ineligible for additional allo-HSCT or T cell therapy, exhibited persistent expression of CD19 and sensitivity to autologous 19-28z T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which suggests potential clinical benefit of additional CAR-modified T cell infusions. These results demonstrate the marked antitumor efficacy of 19-28z CAR-modified T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL and the reliability of this therapy to induce profound molecular remissions, forming a highly effective bridge to potentially curative therapy with subsequent allo-HSCT.","Adult Aged Antigens, CD19/*metabolism Cells, Cultured Female Humans Immunotherapy/methods Male Middle Aged Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/*physiology Treatment Outcome Young Adult"
23508604,Risks and benefits associated with antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections: a cohort study.,Ann Fam Med,Meropol SB and Localio AR and Metlay JP,Missing,"PURPOSE: Antibiotics are frequently prescribed for acute nonspecific respiratory infections (ARIs), presumably to avoid small risks of progression to serious bacterial illness. However, even low risks of associated adverse drug events could result in many such events at the population level. Our objective was to assess the risks and benefits of antibiotic use in a cohort of patients with ARIs, comparing outcomes of patients who were prescribed antibiotics with outcomes of patients not receiving antibiotics. METHODS: We used a June 1986 to August 2006 cohort of adult patients with ARI visits from a UK primary care database. Exposure was an antibiotic prescribed with the visit. Primary outcomes were hospitalization within 15 days for (1) severe adverse drug events (hypersensitivity, diarrhea, seizure, arrhythmia, hepatic or renal failure), and (2) community-acquired pneumonia. RESULTS: The cohort included 1,531,019 visits with an ARI diagnosis; prescriptions for antibiotics were given in 65% of cases. The adjusted risk difference for treated vs untreated patients per 100,000 visits was 1.07 fewer adverse events (95% CI, -4.52 to 2.38; P = .54) and 8.16 fewer pneumonia hospitalizations (95% CI, -13.24 to -3.08; P = .002). The number needed to treat to prevent 1 hospitalization for pneumonia was 12,255. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients with ARI who were not treated with antibiotics, patients who were treated with antibiotics were not at increased risk of severe adverse drug events and had a small decreased risk of pneumonia hospitalization. This small benefit from antibiotics for a common ambulatory diagnosis creates persistent tension; at the societal level, physicians are compelled to reduce antibiotic prescribing, thus minimizing future resistance, whereas at the encounter level, they are compelled to optimize the benefit-risk balance for that patient.","Acute Disease Adult Anti-Bacterial Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use Community-Acquired Infections/*epidemiology Female Great Britain/epidemiology Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data Humans Male Medical Records/statistics & numerical data Middle Aged Outcome Assessment (Health Care)/statistics & numerical data Pneumonia, Bacterial/*epidemiology/etiology Primary Health Care/methods/*statistics & numerical data Respiratory Tract Infections/complications/*drug therapy Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment"
23519941,Promoting the well-being of children whose parents are gay or lesbian.,Pediatrics,Missing,Missing,"To promote optimal health and well-being of all children, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supports access for all children to (1) civil marriage rights for their parents and (2) willing and capable foster and adoptive parents, regardless of the parents' sexual orientation. The AAP has always been an advocate for, and has developed policies to support, the optimal physical, mental, and social health and well-being of all infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. In so doing, the AAP has supported families in all their diversity, because the family has always been the basic social unit in which children develop the supporting and nurturing relationships with adults that they need to thrive. Children may be born to, adopted by, or cared for temporarily by married couples, nonmarried couples, single parents, grandparents, or legal guardians, and any of these may be heterosexual, gay or lesbian, or of another orientation. Children need secure and enduring relationships with committed and nurturing adults to enhance their life experiences for optimal social-emotional and cognitive development. Scientific evidence affirms that children have similar developmental and emotional needs and receive similar parenting whether they are raised by parents of the same or different genders. If a child has 2 living and capable parents who choose to create a permanent bond by way of civil marriage, it is in the best interests of their child(ren) that legal and social institutions allow and support them to do so, irrespective of their sexual orientation. If 2 parents are not available to the child, adoption or foster parenting remain acceptable options to provide a loving home for a child and should be available without regard to the sexual orientation of the parent(s).","Adolescent Adoption/*legislation & jurisprudence/psychology Child Child Development Child Psychology *Child Welfare Child, Preschool Female Foster Home Care/*legislation & jurisprudence/psychology *Homosexuality, Female *Homosexuality, Male Humans Infant Male Marriage/*legislation & jurisprudence/psychology Parent-Child Relations *Parents Public Policy United States Young Adult"
23508597,Screening for hypertension annually compared with current practice.,Ann Fam Med,Garrison GM and Oberhelman S,mayo,"PURPOSE: Hypertension is the most common diagnosis in ambulatory care, yet little evidence exists regarding recommended screening intervals or the sensitivity and specificity of a routine office-based blood pressure measurement, the most common screening test. Screening for hypertension is usually performed by measuring blood pressure at every outpatient visit, which often results in transiently elevated findings among adults who do not have a diagnosis of hypertension. We hypothesize that a more limited annual screening strategy may increase specificity while maintaining sensitivity. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study of 372 adults without hypertension and 68 patients with newly diagnosed hypertension was conducted to compare the usual screening practice of checking blood pressure at every visit with a second strategy that considered only annual blood pressure measurements. RESULTS: Specificity improved from 70.4% (95% CI, 65.5%-75.0%) for the usual practice to 82.0% (95% CI, 77.7%-85.8%) for the annual screening strategy. No statistically significant difference in sensitivity existed between the 2 methods.

With changing sexual behaviors, SCCA incidence and patient demographics may also have changed in recent years. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results public-use data set from 1973 to 2009 was analyzed to determine incidence trends for and demographic factors characterizing SCCA. Joinpoint analyses identified time points when incidence rates changed. For comparison, similar analyses were conducted for anal adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Joinpoint analyses identified 1997 as the single inflection point among 11,231 patients with SCCA, at which the slope of incidence rates statistically increased (1997 to 2009 v 1973 to 1996: risk ratio [RR], 2.2; 95% CI, 2.1 to 2.3). Annual percent change (APC) increased for all SCCA stages and was the greatest for anal carcinoma in situ (CIS; APC, 14.2; 95% CI, 10.2 to 18.4). Demographic changes characterizing later versus earlier time period included younger age at diagnosis and rising incidence rates in all stage, sex, and racial groups. During 1997 to 2009, women were less likely to present with CIS (RR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.3) but more likely to present with localized (RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.3) and regional SCCA (RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4 to 1.7). In contrast, adenocarcinoma APCs among 1,791 patients remained stable during this time period. CONCLUSION: CIS and SCCA incidence increased dramatically after 1997 for men and women, although men were more likely to be diagnosed with CIS. These changes likely resulted from available screening in men and argue for efforts to identify high-risk individuals who may benefit from screening.","Adenocarcinoma/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality Adult Age Factors Aged Anus Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality Carcinoma in Situ/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Neoplasm Staging Prognosis Prospective Studies SEER Program Survival Rate United States/epidemiology Young Adult"

METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial design was used to study OMT and UST for short-term relief of nonspecific chronic low back pain. The 455 patients were randomized to OMT (n = 230) or sham OMT (n = 225) main effects groups, and to UST (n = 233) or sham UST (n = 222) main effects groups. Six treatment sessions were provided over 8 weeks. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed to measure moderate and substantial improvements in low back pain at week 12 (30% or greater and 50% or greater pain reductions from baseline, respectively). Five secondary outcomes, safety, and treatment adherence were also assessed. RESULTS: There was no statistical interaction between OMT and UST. Patients receiving OMT were more likely than patients receiving sham OMT to achieve moderate (response ratio [RR] = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.16-1.64; P <.001) and substantial (RR = 1.41, 95% CI, 1.13-1.76; P = .002) improvements in low back pain at week 12. These improvements met the Cochrane Back Review Group criterion for a medium effect size. Back-specific functioning, general health, work disability specific to low back pain, safety outcomes, and treatment adherence did not differ between patients receiving OMT and sham OMT. Nevertheless, patients in the OMT group were more likely to be very satisfied with their back care throughout the study (P <.001). Patients receiving OMT used prescription drugs for low back pain less frequently during the 12 weeks than did patients in the sham OMT group (use ratio = 0.66, 95% CI, 0.43-1.00; P = .048). Ultrasound therapy was not efficacious. CONCLUSIONS: The OMT regimen met or exceeded the Cochrane Back Review Group criterion for a medium effect size in relieving chronic low back pain. It was safe, parsimonious, and well accepted by patients.","Adult Chronic Disease Female Humans Low Back Pain/*therapy Male *Manipulation, Osteopathic Middle Aged Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care) Statistics, Nonparametric Texas *Ultrasonic Therapy"

The effect size for aggressive lung cancers was larger than that observed for other types of lung cancer. Therefore, we hypothesized that soy consumption may favorably affect the overall survival of patients with lung cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This analysis included 444 women with incident lung cancer identified from the Shanghai Women's Health Study. Prediagnosis soy food intake was assessed at enrollment and reassessed 2 years later. Proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between soy food intake and overall survival. RESULTS: Of the 444 patients with lung cancer, 318 died during follow-up. Initial analyses including all patients showed that higher intake of soy food was associated with better overall survival after adjusting for demographic and lifestyle characteristics and other nonclinical factors. Larger effect sizes for the association were found after additional adjustment for tumor stage and treatment in analyses including 301 patients with data available on these clinical factors. Compared with the median intake of soy food, fully adjusted hazard ratios for total mortality associated with the 10th, 30th, 70th, and 90th percentiles of intake were 1.81 (95% CI, 1.26 to 2.59), 1.25 (95% CI, 1.09 to 1.42), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.97), and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.16), respectively. Similar inverse associations were observed for dietary isoflavone intake. CONCLUSION: This study suggests, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, that, among women with lung cancer, prediagnosis intake of soy food is associated with better overall survival.",Adult Aged China/epidemiology *Eating Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Longitudinal Studies Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/*mortality Male Middle Aged Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Staging Prognosis Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Soy Foods/*statistics & numerical data Survival Rate
23511234,Does fetal exposure to SSRIs or maternal depression impact infant growth?,Am J Psychiatry,Wisner KL and Bogen DL and Sit D and McShea M and Hughes C and Rizzo D and Confer A and Luther J and Eng H and Wisniewski SW,northwestern,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the growth of infants born to women with antenatal major depressive disorder, either untreated or treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, and infants born to a nondepressed, nonmedicated comparison group across the first year of life. METHOD: In this prospective observational study, pregnant women were evaluated at weeks 20, 30, and 36 of gestation, and mother and infant pairs were assessed at 2, 12, 26, and 52 weeks postpartum. Three nonoverlapping groups of women were defined according to their pregnancy exposures: 1) no SSRI and no depression (N=97), 2) SSRI (N=46), and 3) major depression without SSRI (N=31). Maternal demographic and clinical characteristics and newborn outcomes were compared across exposure groups. Infant weight, length, and head circumference were measured by a physician or physician's assistant who was blind to depression and SSRI exposure status at each postpartum time point. RESULTS: Both adjusted and unadjusted analyses revealed neither antenatal major depression nor SSRI exposure was significantly associated with infant weight, length, or head circumference relative to nonexposure to either. In addition, the interaction of group and prepregnancy body mass index was also evaluated, and no significant synergistic effect was identified. Similarly, no differential effect of group over time was observed for weight, length, or head circumference. CONCLUSIONS: In utero exposure to major depression or SSRI antidepressants did not affect infant growth with respect to weight, length, or head circumference from birth through 12 months of age.","Adolescent Adult Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/adverse effects/therapeutic use Body Size/*drug effects Case-Control Studies Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy Female Fetal Development/*drug effects Head/growth & development Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Pregnancy Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*chemically induced Prospective Studies Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use"

METHODS: A population cohort with hip/knee arthritis (osteoarthritis [OA] or inflammatory arthritis) ages >/=55 years was recruited between 1996 and 1998 (baseline) and assessed annually for demographics, troublesome joints, health status, and overall hip/knee arthritis severity using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA Index (WOMAC). Survey data were linked with administrative databases to identify primary TJAs. Good outcome was defined as an improvement in WOMAC summary score greater than or equal to the minimal important difference (MID; 0.5 SD of the mean change). Logistic regression and Akaike's information criterion were used to determine the optimal number of predictors and the best model of that size. Log Poisson regression was used to determine the relative risk (RR) for a good outcome. RESULTS: Primary TJA was performed in 202 patients (mean age 71.0 years; 79.7% female; 82.7% with >1 troublesome hip/knee; 65.8% knee replacements). Mean improvement in WOMAC summary score was 10.2 points (SD 18.05; MID 9 points). Of these patients, 53.5% experienced a good outcome. Four predictors were optimal. The best 4-variable model included pre-TJA WOMAC, comorbidity, number of troublesome hips/knees, and arthritis type (C statistic 0.80). The probability of a good outcome was greater with worse (higher) pre-TJA WOMAC summary scores (adjusted RR 1.32 per 10-point increase; P < 0.0001), fewer troublesome hips/knees (adjusted RR 0.82 per joint; P = 0.002), OA (adjusted RR for rheumatoid arthritis versus OA 0.33; P = 0.009), and fewer comorbidities (adjusted RR per condition 0.88; P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: In an OA cohort with a high prevalence of multiple troublesome joints and comorbidity, only half achieved a good TJA outcome, defined as improved pain and disability. A more comprehensive assessment of the benefits and risks of TJA is warranted.","Aged Arthritis, Rheumatoid/physiopathology/rehabilitation/*surgery *Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip *Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee Comorbidity Female Health Status Humans Male Osteoarthritis, Hip/physiopathology/rehabilitation/*surgery Osteoarthritis, Knee/physiopathology/rehabilitation/*surgery Pain/rehabilitation Postoperative Complications Predictive Value of Tests Prospective Studies Quality of Life Recovery of Function Risk Assessment Severity of Illness Index Treatment Outcome"
23568182,Development of an audio-based virtual gaming environment to assist with navigation skills in the blind.,J Vis Exp,Connors EC and Yazzolino LA and Sanchez J and Merabet LB,Missing,"Audio-based Environment Simulator (AbES) is virtual environment software designed to improve real world navigation skills in the blind. Using only audio based cues and set within the context of a video game metaphor, users gather relevant spatial information regarding a building's layout. This allows the user to develop an accurate spatial cognitive map of a large-scale three-dimensional space that can be manipulated for the purposes of a real indoor navigation task. After game play, participants are then assessed on their ability to navigate within the target physical building represented in the game. Preliminary results suggest that early blind users were able to acquire relevant information regarding the spatial layout of a previously unfamiliar building as indexed by their performance on a series of navigation tasks. These tasks included path finding through the virtual and physical building, as well as a series of drop off tasks. We find that the immersive and highly interactive nature of the AbES software appears to greatly engage the blind user to actively explore the virtual environment.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether vitamin D3 supplementation inhibits the progression of PD on the basis of patient VDR subgroups. DESIGN: Patients with PD (n = 114) were randomly assigned to receive vitamin D3 supplements (n = 56; 1200 IU/d) or a placebo (n = 58) for 12 mo in a double-blind setting. Outcomes were clinical changes from baseline and the percentage of patients who showed no worsening of the modified Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). RESULTS: Compared with the placebo, vitamin D3 significantly prevented the deterioration of the HY stage in patients [difference between groups: P = 0.005; mean +/- SD change within vitamin D3 group: +0.02 +/- 0.62 (P = 0.79); change within placebo group: +0.33 +/- 0.70 (P = 0.0006)]. Interaction analyses showed that VDR FokI genotypes modified the effect of vitamin D3 on changes in the HY stage (P-interaction = 0.045), UPDRS total (P-interaction = 0.039), and UPDRS part II (P-interaction = 0.021). Compared with the placebo, vitamin D3 significantly prevented deterioration of the HY stage in patients with FokI TT [difference between groups: P = 0.009; change within vitamin D3 group: -0.38 +/- 0.48 (P = 0.91); change within placebo group, +0.63 +/- 0.77 (P = 0.009)] and FokI CT [difference between groups: P = 0.020; change within vitamin D3 group: +/-0.00 +/- 0.60 (P = 0.78); change within placebo group: +0.37 +/- 0.74 (P = 0.014)] but not FokI CC. Similar trends were observed in UPDRS total and part II. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D3 supplementation may stabilize PD for a short period in patients with FokI TT or CT genotypes without triggering hypercalcemia, although this effect may be nonspecific for PD.

23400833,"Does removal of out-of-pocket costs for cervical and breast cancer screening work? A quasi-experimental study to evaluate the impact on attendance, attendance inequality and average cost per uptake of a Japanese government intervention.",Int J Cancer,Tabuchi T and Hoshino T and Nakayama T and Ito Y and Ioka A and Miyashiro I and Tsukuma H,Missing,"Reducing out-of-pocket costs is known to improve mammography attendance, but an evidence gap remains concerning Pap smear testing. The Japanese government implemented a politically determined intervention to remove out-of-pocket costs for Pap smear tests and mammography attendance, costing US$148 million, in 2009. It targeted women when they reached the first year of a 5-year age group (i.e., 20, 25, 30 years) with the aim of reducing attendance inequality. Our objective is to evaluate the intervention in terms of uptake and average cost per uptake for cancer screening attendance and to assess socioeconomic inequalities in cancer screening attendance pre- and postintervention. A quasi-experimental study utilizing national repeated cross sections, observed pre- and postintervention, which compared intervention and comparison groups by the Difference-in-Differences method, was conducted. Outcome measures were uptake of cancer screening attendance resulting from the intervention with average cost per uptake and broad inequality indicators for cancer screening attendance according to socioeconomic inequality. In total, 34,043 age-eligible, noninstitutionalized women were analyzed. Uptake among the overall population was 13.9% point in the age- and income-adjusted model for Pap smear and 9.8% point for mammography, with an average cost of US$139 per uptake. The intervention increased inequality indicators in Pap smear attendance (more than +100%) but decreased inequality in mammography attendance (ranging from -12.9 to -74.1%) within the intervention group. In conclusion, removing out-of-pocket costs improves female cancer screening uptake in Japan but may not be cost-saving. Although cost removal reduces inequalities in attendance for mammography, it appears to increase inequalities in Pap smear attendance.","Adult Female *Financing, Personal *Health Care Costs Humans Japan Mass Screening/*economics/utilization Middle Aged *Social Justice Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*diagnosis Uterine Neoplasms/*diagnosis"
23536013,Conserved shifts in the gut microbiota due to gastric bypass reduce host weight and adiposity.,Sci Transl Med,Liou AP and Paziuk M and Luevano JM Jr and Machineni S and Turnbaugh PJ and Kaplan LM,Missing,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) results in rapid weight loss, reduced adiposity, and improved glucose metabolism. These effects are not simply attributable to decreased caloric intake or absorption, but the mechanisms linking rearrangement of the gastrointestinal tract to these metabolic outcomes are largely unknown. Studies in humans and rats have shown that RYGB restructures the gut microbiota, prompting the hypothesis that some of the effects of RYGB are caused by altered host-microbial interactions. To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model of RYGB that recapitulates many of the metabolic outcomes in humans. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of murine fecal samples collected after RYGB surgery, sham surgery, or sham surgery coupled to caloric restriction revealed that alterations to the gut microbiota after RYGB are conserved among humans, rats, and mice, resulting in a rapid and sustained increase in the relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria (Escherichia) and Verrucomicrobia (Akkermansia). These changes were independent of weight change and caloric restriction, were detectable throughout the length of the gastrointestinal tract, and were most evident in the distal gut, downstream of the surgical manipulation site. Transfer of the gut microbiota from RYGB-treated mice to nonoperated, germ-free mice resulted in weight loss and decreased fat mass in the recipient animals relative to recipients of microbiota induced by sham surgery, potentially due to altered microbial production of short-chain fatty acids. These findings provide the first empirical support for the claim that changes in the gut microbiota contribute to reduced host weight and adiposity after RYGB surgery.","Adiposity/*physiology Animals Body Weight/*physiology Eating/physiology *Gastric Bypass Gastrointestinal Tract/*microbiology Male Metagenome/*physiology Mice Mice, Inbred C57BL"

Current inactivated virus vaccines require expensive high containment facilities for their production and maintenance of a cold-chain for their activity. We have addressed both of these major drawbacks. Firstly we have developed methods to efficiently express recombinant empty capsids. Expression constructs aimed at lowering the levels and activity of the viral protease required for the cleavage of the capsid protein precursor were used; this enabled the synthesis of empty A-serotype capsids in eukaryotic cells at levels potentially attractive to industry using both vaccinia virus and baculovirus driven expression. Secondly we have enhanced capsid stability by incorporating a rationally designed mutation, and shown by X-ray crystallography that stabilised and wild-type empty capsids have essentially the same structure as intact virus. Cattle vaccinated with recombinant capsids showed sustained virus neutralisation titres and protection from challenge 34 weeks after immunization. This approach to vaccine antigen production has several potential advantages over current technologies by reducing production costs, eliminating the risk of infectivity and enhancing the temperature stability of the product. Similar strategies that will optimize host cell viability during expression of a foreign toxic gene and/or improve capsid stability could allow the production of safe vaccines for other pathogenic picornaviruses of humans and animals.","Animals Antigens, Viral/chemistry/genetics/immunology Biomedical Engineering/*methods Capsid Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism Cattle Cattle Diseases/immunology/prevention & control Cercopithecus aethiops Crystallography, X-Ray Foot-and-Mouth Disease/immunology/*prevention & control Genetic Vectors/chemistry/genetics HEK293 Cells Humans Models, Molecular Picornaviridae/*genetics/metabolism/physiology Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics Sf9 Cells Spodoptera Vaccination/adverse effects/methods/veterinary Vaccinia virus/chemistry/genetics/immunology Viral Vaccines/adverse effects/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics"
23401486,Effect of moderate to vigorous physical activity on long-term clinical outcomes and pain severity in fibromyalgia.,Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken),Kaleth AS and Saha CK and Jensen MP and Slaven JE and Ang DC,iupui,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between long-term maintenance of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and clinical outcomes in fibromyalgia (FM). METHODS: Patients with FM (n = 170) received individualized exercise prescriptions and completed baseline and followup physical activity assessments using the Community Health Activities Model Program for Seniors questionnaire at weeks 12, 24, and 36. The primary outcome was the change in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Physical Impairment (FIQ-PI) score. The secondary outcomes included improvements in overall well-being (FIQ total score), pain severity ratings, and depression. RESULTS: Using a threshold increase in MVPA of >/=10 metabolic equivalent hours/week above usual activities, 27 subjects (15.9%) increased and sustained (SUS-PA), 68 (40%) increased but then declined (UNSUS-PA), and 75 (44.1%) did not achieve (LO-PA) this benchmark. Compared to LO-PA subjects, both SUS-PA and UNSUS-PA subjects reported greater improvement in FIQ-PI (P < 0.01) and FIQ total score (P < 0.05). Additionally, the SUS-PA group reported greater improvement in pain severity compared to the LO-PA group (P < 0.05). However, there were no significant group differences between SUS-PA and UNSUS-PA for any primary or secondary outcome measure. CONCLUSION: Increased participation in MVPA for at least 12 weeks improved physical function and overall well-being in patients with FM. Although sustained physical activity was not associated with greater clinical benefit compared with unsustained physical activity, these findings also suggest that performing greater volumes of physical activity is not associated with worsening pain in FM.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of prebiotic given to infants for the prevention of allergy. SEARCH METHODS: We performed an updated search in August 2012 of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, citations, expert informants and clinical trials registries. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared the use of a prebiotic to no prebiotic, or a specific prebiotic compared to a different prebiotic in infants for prevention of allergy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Assessment of trial quality, data extraction and synthesis of data were performed using the standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration. MAIN RESULTS: The 2012 update identified 13 studies classified as ongoing or awaiting classification (yet to report allergy outcomes). Forty-three studies were excluded, primarily as no allergy data were reported, although none of these enrolled infants were at high risk of allergy. Four studies enrolling 1428 infants were eligible for inclusion. All studies were at high risk of attrition bias. Allergy outcomes were reported from four months to two years of age.Meta-analysis of two studies (226 infants) found no significant difference in infant asthma although significant heterogeneity was found between studies. Meta-analysis of four studies found a significant reduction in eczema (1218 infants, typical risk ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.97; typical risk difference -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.00; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 25, 95% CI 14 to > 100; P = 0.03). No statistically significant heterogeneity was found between studies. One study reported no significant difference in urticaria.No statistically significant subgroup differences were found according to infant risk of allergy or type of infant feed. However, individual studies reported a significant reduction in asthma and eczema from supplementation with a mixture of galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharide (GOS/FOS 9:1 ratio) (8 g/L) in infants at high risk of allergy; and in eczema from supplementation with GOS/FOS (9:1) (6.8 g/L) and acidic oligosacccharide (1.2 g/L) in infants not selected for allergy risk. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed before routine use of prebiotics can be recommended for prevention of allergy in formula fed infants. There is some evidence that a prebiotic supplement added to infant feeds may prevent eczema. It is unclear whether the use of prebiotic should be restricted to infants at high risk of allergy or may have an effect in low risk populations; or whether it may have an effect on other allergic diseases including asthma.","Asthma/prevention & control Eczema/prevention & control Food Hypersensitivity/prevention & control Humans Hypersensitivity/*prevention & control Infant *Infant Formula Infant, Newborn Milk Hypersensitivity/prevention & control Oligosaccharides/*therapeutic use *Prebiotics Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Urticaria/prevention & control"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study involving patients who presented to urology and family practice clinics. A questionnaire was used to assess knowledge regarding the association between smoking and various diseases. Participants were also asked to evaluate a novel smoking warning label for bladder cancer. RESULTS: A total of 291 (97%) patients responded to the questionnaire including 143 (95.3%) at urology clinics and 148 (98.7%) at family practice clinics. Overall only 45.2% of respondents were aware of the association between smoking and bladder cancer compared to 97.4% who knew that there was an association between smoking and lung cancer. There were no significant differences in knowledge between those at urology and family practice clinics. After viewing the warning label, 58.1% of respondents stated that it had changed their opinion on smoking and bladder cancer, and 74.8% felt that this label would be an effective tool to raise awareness of the issue. Patients who changed their opinion had statistically significantly less initial knowledge about the association between smoking and bladder cancer (36.7% vs 57.5% for those who did not change their opinion, p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of the link between smoking and bladder cancer remains low. The use of a smoking warning label may help raise awareness of this important public health issue.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over *Awareness Chi-Square Distribution Cross-Sectional Studies Female Humans Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Pilot Projects *Product Labeling Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Smoking/*adverse effects *Smoking Cessation Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*etiology"

With the development of robotic surgery, surgeons are faced with new surgical positioning, requiring attention to ensure patient safety. Published reports that address positioning injury during robotic surgery are sparse and none address the overall incidence. In this study we determine the incidence of positioning injury during robotic assisted urological surgery, identify risk factors and describe the time to resolution of the neurological injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed all adult urological cases at our institution that used the da Vinci(R) Si and da Vinci Standard(R) Surgical System from January 2010 to December 2011. We characterized risk factors into the 4 domains of positioning, operative, patient specific and anesthesia related. Within these 4 categories we collected data on 13 specific aspects of patient care to determine their association with positioning injury. RESULTS: Of 334 operations 22 positioning injuries (6.6%) were documented. Of these injuries 13 (59.1%) resolved within 1 month, 4 (18.2%) resolved between 1 and 6 months, and 5 (22.7%) persisted beyond 6 months. We found operative time (p <0.0001), in-room time (p <0.0001) and ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) class (p = 0.0033) were significantly associated with injury. CONCLUSIONS: Positioning injuries are under recognized in robotic assisted urological surgery and may persist beyond 6 months. Consideration must be given to counseling patients about the risks of positioning injuries, especially for long operations.

Previous reports indicate that the incidence of CD is increasing. We examined the prevalence of CD in a well-defined US county. METHODS: Population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, USA. Using the infrastructure of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, medical, histopathology, and CD serology records were used to identify all new cases of CD in Olmsted County since 2000. Age- and sex-specific and adjusted (to the US white 2000 population) incidence rates for CD were estimated. Clinical presentation at diagnosis was also assessed. RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2010, 249 individuals (157 female or 63%, median age 37.9 years) were diagnosed with CD in Olmsted County. The overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence of CD in the study period was 17.4 (95% confidence interval (CI)=15.2-19.6) per 100,000 person-years, increasing from 11.1 (95% CI=6.8-15.5) in 2000-2001 to 17.3 (95% CI=13.3-21.3) in 2008-2010. The temporal trend in incidence rates was modeled as a two-slope pattern, with the incidence leveling off after 2004. Based on the two classic CD symptoms of diarrhea and weight loss, the relative frequency of classical CD among incident cases decreased over time between 2000 and 2010 (P=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CD has continued to increase in the past decade in a North-American population.","Adolescent Adult Age Distribution Aged Aged, 80 and over Celiac Disease/*diagnosis/*epidemiology Child Child, Preschool Female Humans Incidence Infant Male Middle Aged Minnesota/epidemiology Models, Statistical Prevalence Sex Distribution"

However, evidence on the effectiveness of this intervention is limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the effects of a 50% price discount on F&Vs or nutrition education or a combination of both on supermarket purchases. DESIGN: A 6-mo randomized controlled trial within Dutch supermarkets was conducted. Regular supermarket shoppers were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: 50% price discounts on F&Vs, nutrition education, 50% price discounts plus nutrition education, or no intervention. A total of 199 participants provided baseline data; 151 (76%) were included in the final analysis. F&V purchases were measured by using supermarket register receipts at baseline, at 1 mo after the start of the intervention, at 3 mo, at 6 mo (end of the intervention period), and 3 mo after the intervention ended (9 mo). RESULTS: Adjusted multilevel models showed significantly higher F&V purchases (per household/2 wk) as a result of the price discount (+3.9 kg; 95% CI: 1.5, 6.3 kg) and the discount plus education intervention (+5.6 kg; 95% CI: 3.2, 7.9 kg) at 6 mo compared with control. Moreover, the percentage of participants who consumed recommended amounts of F&Vs (>/=400 g/d) increased from 42.5% at baseline to 61.3% at 6 mo in both discount groups (P = 0.03). Education alone had no significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: Discounting F&Vs is a promising intervention strategy because it resulted in substantially higher F&V purchases, and no adverse effects were observed. Therefore, pricing strategies form an important focus for future interventions or policy. However, the long-term effects and the ultimate health outcomes require further investigation.

METHODS: Medline, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, PsycInfo, and Education Resources Information Center were searched from 1980 to November 24, 2011. Selected studies were comparative, and enrolled children <6 years with clinically significant disruptive behavior, including ADHD. The interventions evaluated were parent behavior training (PBT), combined home and school/day care interventions, and methylphenidate use. Data were extracted by using customized software. Two independent raters evaluated studies as good, fair, or poor by using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies Risk of Bias. Overall strength of evidence (SOE) was rated for each intervention's effectiveness, accounting for study design, systematic error, consistency of results, directness of evidence, and certainty regarding outcome. RESULTS: Fifty-five studies were examined. Only studies examining PBT interventions could be pooled statistically using meta-analysis. Eight ""good"" studies examined PBT, total n = 424; SOE was high for improved child behavior, standardized mean difference = -0.68 (95% confidence interval: -0.88 to -0.47), with minimal heterogeneity among studies. Only 1 good study evaluated methylphenidate, total n = 114; therefore, SOE for methylphenidate was low. Combined home and school/day care interventions showed inconsistent results. The literature reported adverse effects for methylphenidate but not for PBT. CONCLUSIONS: With more studies consistently documenting effectiveness, PBT interventions have greater evidence of effectiveness than methylphenidate for treatment of preschoolers at risk for ADHD.","Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*diagnosis/*therapy Behavior Therapy/*methods Central Nervous System Stimulants/therapeutic use Child Behavior Child, Preschool Combined Modality Therapy Female Humans Intervention Studies Male Methylphenidate/*therapeutic use Monitoring, Physiologic/methods Ontario Parents/*education Prognosis Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Risk Assessment Severity of Illness Index Treatment Outcome"

FINDINGS: The rates of alcohol use [risk difference (RD) = 7.85, 99.91% confidence interval (CI) = 4.44-11.26], binge drinking (RD = 8.02, 99.91% CI = 4.91-11.13), marijuana use (RD = 5.30, 99.91% CI = 2.83-7.77), other illegal drug use (RD = 7.10, 99.91% CI = 4.63-9.56) and prescription drug misuse (RD = 8.58, 99.91% CI = 5.64-11.51) are greater for children of currently or recently deployed parents than for children of parents who are not in the military. The magnitude of the effects is consistent across 6th, 8th and 11th grades. Disrupted living arrangements further accentuate increased substance use, with the largest effect seen in children with a deployed parent who was not living with a parent or relative. CONCLUSIONS: Children of deployed military personnel should be considered at higher risk for substance use than children of non-military citizens.",Alcohol Drinking/*epidemiology Analysis of Variance Child Cross-Sectional Studies *Family Female Humans Iowa Male Military Personnel/*statistics & numerical data Parents Risk Factors Substance-Related Disorders/*epidemiology
23546563,Plasma phospholipid long-chain omega-3 fatty acids and total and cause-specific mortality in older adults: a cohort study.,Ann Intern Med,Mozaffarian D and Lemaitre RN and King IB and Song X and Huang H and Sacks FM and Rimm EB and Wang M and Siscovick DS,harvard,"BACKGROUND: Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega3-PUFAs), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (20:5omega-3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) (22:5omega-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6omega-3), have been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk, but effects on cause-specific and total mortality and potential dose-responses remain controversial. Most observational studies have assessed self-reported dietary intake and most randomized trials have tested effects of adding supplements to dietary intake and evaluated secondary prevention, thus limiting inference for dietary omega3-PUFAs or primary prevention. OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations of plasma phospholipid EPA, DPA, DHA, and total omega3-PUFA levels with total and cause-specific mortality among healthy older adults not receiving supplements. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: 4 U.S. communities. PARTICIPANTS: 2692 U.S. adults aged 74 years (+/-5 years) without prevalent coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, or heart failure at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: Phospholipid fatty acid levels and cardiovascular risk factors were measured in 1992. Relationships with total and cause-specific mortality and incident fatal or nonfatal CHD and stroke through 2008 were assessed. RESULTS: During 30 829 person-years, 1625 deaths (including 570 cardiovascular deaths), 359 fatal and 371 nonfatal CHD events, and 130 fatal and 276 nonfatal strokes occurred. After adjustment, higher plasma levels of omega3-PUFA biomarkers were associated with lower total mortality, with extreme-quintile hazard ratios of 0.83 for EPA (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.98; P for trend = 0.005), 0.77 for DPA (CI, 0.66 to 0.90; P for trend = 0.008), 0.80 for DHA (CI, 0.67 to 0.94; P for trend = 0.006), and 0.73 for total omega3-PUFAs (CI, 0.61 to 0.86; P for trend < 0.001). Lower risk was largely attributable to fewer cardiovascular than noncardiovascular deaths. Individuals in the highest quintile of phospholipid omega3-PUFA level lived an average of 2.22 more years (CI, 0.75 to 3.13 years) after age 65 years than did those in the lowest quintile. LIMITATION: Temporal changes in fatty acid levels and misclassification of causes of death may have resulted in underestimated associations, and unmeasured or imperfectly measured covariates may have caused residual confounding. CONCLUSION: Higher circulating individual and total omega3-PUFA levels are associated with lower total mortality, especially CHD death, in older adults.

23547084,Associations between cigarette smoking status and colon cancer prognosis among participants in North Central Cancer Treatment Group Phase III Trial N0147.,J Clin Oncol,Phipps AI and Shi Q and Newcomb PA and Nelson GD and Sargent DJ and Alberts SR and Limburg PJ,fhcrc,"PURPOSE: By using data from North Central Cancer Treatment Group Phase III Trial N0147, a randomized adjuvant trial of patients with stage III colon cancer, we assessed the relationship between smoking and cancer outcomes, disease-free survival (DFS), and time to recurrence (TTR), accounting for heterogeneity by patient and tumor characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS Before random assignment to infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or FOLFOX plus cetuximab, 1,968 participants completed a questionnaire on smoking history and other risk factors. Cox models assessed the association between smoking history and the primary trial outcome of DFS (ie, time to recurrence or death), as well as TTR, adjusting for other clinical and patient factors. The median follow-up was 3.5 years among patients who did not experience events. RESULTS: Compared with never-smokers, ever smokers experienced significantly shorter DFS (3-year DFS proportion: 70% v 74%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.42). This association persisted after multivariate adjustment (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.49). There was significant interaction in this association by BRAF mutation status (P = .03): smoking was associated with shorter DFS in patients with BRAF wild-type (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.66) but not BRAF mutated (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.29) colon cancer. Smoking was more strongly associated with poorer DFS in those with KRAS mutated versus KRAS wild-type colon cancer (HR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.12 to 2.00] v HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.39]), although interaction by KRAS mutation status was not statistically significant (P = .07). Associations were comparable in analyses of TTR. CONCLUSION: Overall, smoking was significantly associated with shorter DFS and TTR in patients with colon cancer.

23487389,"A meta-analysis of self-administered vs directly observed therapy effect on microbiologic failure, relapse, and acquired drug resistance in tuberculosis patients.",Clin Infect Dis,Pasipanodya JG and Gumbo T,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies and Monte Carlo simulations have suggested that there is a relatively limited role of adherence in acquired drug resistance (ADR) and that very high levels of nonadherence are needed for therapy failure. We evaluated the superiority of directly observed therapy (DOT) for tuberculosis patients vs self-administered therapy (SAT) in decreasing ADR, microbiologic failure, and relapse in meta-analyses. METHODS: Prospective studies performed between 1965 and 2012 in which adult patients with microbiologically proven pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis were separately assigned to either DOT or SAT as part of short-course chemotherapy were chosen. Endpoints were microbiologic failure, relapse, and ADR in patients on either DOT or SAT. RESULTS: Ten studies, 5 randomized and 5 observational, met selection criteria: 8774 patients were allocated to DOT and 3708 were allocated to SAT. For DOT vs SAT, the pooled risk difference for microbiologic failure was .0 (95% confidence interval [CI], -.01 to .01), for relapse .01 (95% CI, -.03 to .06), and for ADR 0.0 (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.01). The incidence rates for DOT vs SAT were 1.5% (95% CI, 1.3%-1.8%) vs 1.7% (95% CI, 1.2%-2.2%) for microbiologic failure, 3.7% (95% CI, 0.7%-17.6%) vs 2.3% (95% CI, 0.7%-7.2%) for relapse, and 1.5% (95% CI, 0.2%-9.90%) vs 0.9% (95% CI, 0.4%-2.3%) for ADR, respectively. There was no evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: DOT was not significantly better than SAT in preventing microbiologic failure, relapse, or ADR, in evidence-based medicine. Resources should be shifted to identify other causes of poor microbiologic outcomes.","Adult Antitubercular Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology Directly Observed Therapy/*methods *Drug Resistance, Bacterial Humans Medication Adherence Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*drug effects/isolation & purification Recurrence Self Administration/methods Treatment Failure Tuberculosis/*drug therapy/*microbiology"
23333061,Recovery of cognitive function after coronary artery bypass graft operations.,Ann Thorac Surg,Bruce KM and Yelland GW and Smith JA and Robinson SR,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The effect of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) operations on cognition was examined after controlling for the operation, emotional state, preexisting cognitive impairment, and repeated experience with cognitive tests. METHODS: On-pump CABG patients (n=16), thoracic surgical patients (n=15), and a nonsurgical control group (n=15) were tested preoperatively, and at 1 and 8 weeks postoperatively, using a battery of cognitive tests and an emotional state assessment. Patient groups were similar in age, sex, level of education, and premorbid intelligence quotient score. Surgical group data were normalized against data from the nonsurgical control group before statistical analysis. RESULTS: CABG patients performed worse on every subtest before the operation, and this disadvantage persisted after the operation. Anxiety, depression, and stress were associated with impaired cognitive performance in the surgical groups 1 week after the operation: 44% of CABG patients and 33% of surgical control patients were significantly impaired; yet, by 8 weeks, nearly all patients had recovered to preoperative levels, with 25% of CABG and 13% of surgical control patients improving beyond their preoperative performance. CONCLUSIONS: Stress, anxiety, and depression impair cognitive performance in association with CABG and thoracic operations. Most patients recover to, or exceed, preoperative levels of cognition within 8 weeks. Thus, after controlling for nonsurgical factors, the prospects of a tangible improvement in cognition after CABG are high.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cognition/*physiology Coronary Artery Bypass/*psychology Coronary Artery Disease/psychology/*surgery Emotions/*physiology Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Middle Aged Postoperative Period *Recovery of Function Treatment Outcome"

DESIGN AND SETTING: Online survey hosted at the University of East London with links from TECC/TWEL websites from September 2011 to May 2012. MEASUREMENTS: Online questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand three hundred and forty-seven respondents from 33 countries (72% European), mean age 43 years, 70% male, 96% Causasian, 44% educated to degree level or above. FINDINGS: Seventy-four percent of participants reported not smoking for at least a few weeks since using the e-cigarette and 70% reported reduced urge to smoke. Seventy-two percent of participants used a 'tank' system, most commonly, the eGo-C (23%). Mean duration of use was 10 months. Only 1% reported exclusive use of non-nicotine (0 mg) containing liquid. E-cigarettes were generally considered to be satisfying to use; elicit few side effects; be healthier than smoking; improve cough/breathing; and be associated with low levels of craving. Among ex-smokers, 'time to first vape' was significantly longer than 'time to first cigarette' (t1104 = 11.16, P < 0.001) suggesting a lower level of dependence to e-cigarettes. Ex-smokers reported significantly greater reduction in craving than current smokers (chi(2) 1 = 133.66, P < 0.0007) although few other differences emerged between these groups. Compared with males, females opted more for chocolate/sweet flavours (chi(2) 1 = 16.16, P < 0.001) and liked the e-cigarette because it resembles a cigarette (chi(2) 3 = 42.65, P < 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: We studied the effects of T supplementation with and without progressive resistance training (PRT) on functional performance, strength, and body composition. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 167 generally healthy community-dwelling older men (66 +/- 5 years) with low-normal baseline total T levels (200-350 ng/dL). INTERVENTION: Subjects were randomized to placebo or transdermal T gel [2 doses targeting either a lower (400-550 ng/dL) or higher (600-1000 ng/dL) T range] and to either PRT or no exercise for 12 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was functional performance, whereas secondary outcomes were strength and body composition. RESULTS: A total of 143 men completed the study. At 12 months, total T was 528 +/- 287 ng/dL in subjects receiving any T and 287 +/- 65 ng/dL in the placebo group. In the PRT group, function and strength were not different between T- and placebo-treated subjects, despite greater improvements in fat mass (P = .04) and fat-free mass (P = .01) with T. In the non-PRT group, T did not improve function but improved fat mass (P = .005), fat-free mass (P = .03), and upper body strength (P = .03) compared with placebo. There were fewer cardiovascular events in the T-treated groups compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: T supplementation was well tolerated and improved body composition but had no effect on functional performance. T supplementation improved upper body strength only in nonexercisers compared with placebo.","Activities of Daily Living Aged *Aging Body Composition/drug effects Cardiovascular Diseases/prevention & control Combined Modality Therapy Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Geriatric Assessment *Hormone Replacement Therapy/adverse effects Humans Lost to Follow-Up Male Muscle Strength/drug effects Patient Compliance Patient Dropouts *Resistance Training Severity of Illness Index Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/analysis Testosterone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*deficiency/*therapeutic use Upper Extremity"
23559265,Chronic pain syndromes after ischemic stroke: PRoFESS trial.,Stroke,O'Donnell MJ and Diener HC and Sacco RL and Panju AA and Vinisko R and Yusuf S,Missing,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chronic pain syndromes are reported to be common after stroke, but most previous epidemiological studies have generally included small cohorts of patients with relatively short-term follow-up. In a large cohort with ischemic stroke (Prevention Regimen for Effectively avoiding Second Stroke [PRoFESS] trial), we determined the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical consequence of new poststroke pain syndromes. METHODS: Within the PRoFESS trial (mean follow-up 2.5 years), a standardized chronic pain questionnaire was administered (at the penultimate follow-up visit) to all participants who reported chronic pain since their stroke and did not have a history of chronic pain before their index stroke. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine risk factors for poststroke pain (and pain subtypes), and the association between poststroke pain and cognitive (>/= 3 reduction in Mini-Mental State Examination score) and functional decline (>/= 1 increase in m-Rankin). RESULTS: In total, 15 754 participants were included; of which 1665 participants (10.6%) reported new chronic poststroke pain, and included 431 participants (2.7%) with central poststroke pain, 238 (1.5%) with peripheral neuropathic pain, 208 (1.3%) with pain from spasticity, and 136 participants (0.9%) with pain from shoulder subluxation. More than 1 pain subtype was reported in 86 participants (0.6%). Predictors of poststroke pain included increased stroke severity, female sex, alcohol intake, statin use, depressive symptoms, diabetes mellitus, antithrombotic regimen, and peripheral vascular disease. A new chronic pain syndrome was associated with greater dependence (odds ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.82-2.56). Peripheral neuropathy and pain from spasticity/shoulder subluxation were associated with cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pain syndromes are common after ischemic stroke and are associated with increased functional dependence and cognitive decline.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Brain Ischemia/*complications/epidemiology/psychology Chronic Pain/epidemiology/*etiology Cognition Disorders/epidemiology/etiology Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Pain Measurement Risk Factors Severity of Illness Index Stroke/*complications/epidemiology/psychology"
23535174,"Dietary calcium from dairy and nondairy sources, and risk of symptomatic kidney stones.",J Urol,Taylor EN and Curhan GC,partners,"PURPOSE: Because of high correlations between dairy intake and total dietary calcium, previously reported associations between lower calcium intake and increased kidney stone risk represent de facto associations between milk products and risk. We examined associations between dietary calcium from nondairy and dairy sources, and symptomatic nephrolithiasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed prospective studies in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) in 30,762 men, and in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) I and II in 94,164 and 101,701 women, respectively. We excluded men 60 years old or older because we previously reported inverse associations between calcium intake and risk only in men younger than 60 years. Food frequency questionnaires were used to assess calcium intake every 4 years. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to adjust for age, body mass index, supplemental calcium, diet and other factors. RESULTS: We documented 5,270 incident kidney stones during the combined 56 years of followup. In participants in the highest vs the lowest quintile of nondairy dietary calcium the multivariate relative risk of kidney stones was 0.71 (95% CI 0.56-0.92, p for trend 0.007) in HPFS, 0.82 (95% CI 0.69-0.98, p trend 0.08) in NHS I and 0.74 (95% CI 0.63-0.87, p trend 0.002) in NHS II. When comparing the highest to the lowest quintile of dairy calcium, the multivariate relative risk was 0.77 (95% CI 0.63-0.95, p trend 0.01) for HPFS, 0.83 (95% CI 0.69-0.99, p trend 0.05) for NHS I and 0.76 (95% CI 0.65-0.88, p trend 0.001) for NHS II. CONCLUSIONS: Higher dietary calcium from nondairy or dairy sources is independently associated with a lower kidney stone risk.","Adult Aged *Calcium, Dietary/administration & dosage Dairy Products Humans Kidney Calculi/*epidemiology Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies Risk Assessment"

For some patients, dengue is a life-threatening illness. There are currently no licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics, and substantial vector control efforts have not stopped its rapid emergence and global spread. The contemporary worldwide distribution of the risk of dengue virus infection and its public health burden are poorly known. Here we undertake an exhaustive assembly of known records of dengue occurrence worldwide, and use a formal modelling framework to map the global distribution of dengue risk. We then pair the resulting risk map with detailed longitudinal information from dengue cohort studies and population surfaces to infer the public health burden of dengue in 2010. We predict dengue to be ubiquitous throughout the tropics, with local spatial variations in risk influenced strongly by rainfall, temperature and the degree of urbanization. Using cartographic approaches, we estimate there to be 390 million (95% credible interval 284-528) dengue infections per year, of which 96 million (67-136) manifest apparently (any level of disease severity). This infection total is more than three times the dengue burden estimate of the World Health Organization. Stratification of our estimates by country allows comparison with national dengue reporting, after taking into account the probability of an apparent infection being formally reported. The most notable differences are discussed. These new risk maps and infection estimates provide novel insights into the global, regional and national public health burden imposed by dengue. We anticipate that they will provide a starting point for a wider discussion about the global impact of this disease and will help to guide improvements in disease control strategies using vaccine, drug and vector control methods, and in their economic evaluation.","Cohort Studies Databases, Factual/standards Dengue/*epidemiology/transmission/virology Dengue Virus/physiology Humans Incidence Public Health/statistics & numerical data Quality Control Rain Risk Factors Temperature Tropical Climate Urbanization World Health/*statistics & numerical data World Health Organization"

These relationships have not been examined in low-income minority children. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate, in low-income minority children, whether there is a relationship among the frequency of RTEC consumption and nutrient intakes measured at baseline, and whether there is a relationship between the frequency of RTEC and BMI controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, and energy intake. DESIGN: A longitudinal study design where a cohort was followed for 3 years. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Participants were 625 fourth- through sixth-grade, low-income children living in San Antonio, Texas, and enrolled in the control arm of the Bienestar Diabetes Prevention Program's cluster randomized trial. Three multiple-pass 24-hour dietary recalls were collected at the beginning of their fourth-grade year and at the end of their fifth- and sixth-grade years. Children's age, sex, ethnicity, and height and weight (used to calculate BMI) were collected between August 2001 and May 2004. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed. The frequency of breakfast consumption was examined using a 6x4 cross-tabulation table with chi(2) test to establish categorical differences. The degree of association between BMI percentile and frequency of RTEC consumption adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and nutrition-related parameters were calculated using a partial correlation multivariate linear model analysis. RESULTS: There was a significant positive relationship between the frequency of RTEC consumption and nutrient intakes measured at baseline. There was also a significant inverse relationship between frequency of RTEC consumption and BMI percentile over the cumulative 3-year period controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, and energy intake. CONCLUSIONS: Children who frequently consumed RTEC had greater intakes of essential nutrients at baseline and significantly lower BMI over a 3-year period.","*Body Mass Index *Cereals Child Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena/*physiology Cluster Analysis Cohort Studies Diet/*statistics & numerical data Energy Intake Fast Foods Female Food Habits/physiology *Food, Fortified Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Micronutrients/*administration & dosage Minority Groups/*statistics & numerical data Nutritional Status Nutritive Value Poverty Texas"

Identification of disease-associated variants helps identify targets for genetic testing, prevention, and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic loci associated with late-onset Alzheimer disease in African Americans. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) assembled multiple data sets representing a total of 5896 African Americans (1968 case participants, 3928 control participants) 60 years or older that were collected between 1989 and 2011 at multiple sites. The association of Alzheimer disease with genotyped and imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was assessed in case-control and in family-based data sets. Results from individual data sets were combined to perform an inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis, first with genome-wide analyses and subsequently with gene-based tests for previously reported loci. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Presence of Alzheimer disease according to standardized criteria. RESULTS: Genome-wide significance in fully adjusted models (sex, age, APOE genotype, population stratification) was observed for a SNP in ABCA7 (rs115550680, allele = G; frequency, 0.09 cases and 0.06 controls; odds ratio [OR], 1.79 [95% CI, 1.47-2.12]; P = 2.2 x 10(-9)), which is in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs previously associated with Alzheimer disease in Europeans (0.8 < D' < 0.9). The effect size for the SNP in ABCA7 was comparable with that of the APOE 4-determining SNP rs429358 (allele = C; frequency, 0.30 cases and 0.18 controls; OR, 2.31 [95% CI, 2.19-2.42]; P = 5.5 x 10(-47)).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this meta-analysis of data from African American participants, Alzheimer disease was significantly associated with variants in ABCA7 and with other genes that have been associated with Alzheimer disease in individuals of European ancestry.

However, little is known about diets on drinking days in the US population. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether the diets of drinkers differ on drinking compared with nondrinking days. DESIGN: Data were from the 2003-2008 NHANES Mobile Examination Center interview. We identified 1864 current drinkers (1126 men and 738 women) who completed two 24-h dietary recalls, one of which was on a drinking day and the other of which was on a nondrinking day. Sex-specific repeated-measures analyses that were adjusted for dietary recall order and recall day of the week were used to compare within-individual differences in energy, nutrient, and food-group intakes. Analyses were weighted to produce representative estimates. RESULTS: On their drinking (compared with nondrinking) days, men consumed an excess 168 nonalcohol kcal (P < 0.01), which was reflected in higher intakes of nutrients including total protein (P < 0.001), total fat (P < 0.01), saturated fat (P < 0.01), monounsaturated fat (P < 0.01), potassium (P < 0.001), and sodium (P < 0.05). Men also had higher intakes of food groups including meat (P < 0.001), white potatoes (P < 0.05), and discretionary oil and solid fat (P < 0.05) and lower intakes of total fruit (P < 0.05) and milk (P < 0.05). Women did not consume excess nonalcohol kilocalories but had higher intakes of total fat (P < 0.05), monounsaturated fat (P < 0.05), polyunsaturated fat (P < 0.05), potassium (P < 0.01), and discretionary oil and solid fat (P < 0.05) and lower intakes of milk (P < 0.01) and milk products (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These mostly moderate drinkers had poorer diets on drinking days.

RESULT(S): Among women who had a history of infertility, use of fertility drugs was reported by 44 (24%) of 182 controls and 38 (17%) of 226 cases. Infertile women who used fertility drugs were not at increased risk of developing ovarian tumors compared with infertile women who did not use fertility drugs; the adjusted odds ratio was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.37, 1.11). The findings were similar when stratified by gravidity and when analyzed separately for borderline versus invasive tumors. CONCLUSION(S): We found no statistically significant association between fertility drug use and risk of ovarian tumors. Further larger, prospective studies are needed to confirm this observation.","Aged Case-Control Studies Female Fertility Fertility Agents, Female/*adverse effects Gravidity Humans Incidence Infertility, Female/*drug therapy/physiopathology Logistic Models Middle Aged Minnesota/epidemiology Multivariate Analysis Odds Ratio Ovarian Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology Pregnancy Prevalence Questionnaires Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/*adverse effects Risk Assessment Risk Factors"

Here we address this challenge with a method (termed CLARITY) for the transformation of intact tissue into a nanoporous hydrogel-hybridized form (crosslinked to a three-dimensional network of hydrophilic polymers) that is fully assembled but optically transparent and macromolecule-permeable. Using mouse brains, we show intact-tissue imaging of long-range projections, local circuit wiring, cellular relationships, subcellular structures, protein complexes, nucleic acids and neurotransmitters. CLARITY also enables intact-tissue in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry with multiple rounds of staining and de-staining in non-sectioned tissue, and antibody labelling throughout the intact adult mouse brain. Finally, we show that CLARITY enables fine structural analysis of clinical samples, including non-sectioned human tissue from a neuropsychiatric-disease setting, establishing a path for the transmutation of human tissue into a stable, intact and accessible form suitable for probing structural and molecular underpinnings of physiological function and disease.","Animals Brain/*anatomy & histology Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry Formaldehyde/chemistry Humans Hydrogel/chemistry Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods In Situ Hybridization/methods Lipids/isolation & purification Mice Molecular Imaging/*methods Permeability Phenotype Scattering, Radiation"

In contrast, the relation between alcohol consumption and breast cancer survival is less clear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed pre- and postdiagnostic alcohol intake in a cohort of 22,890 women with incident invasive breast cancer who were residents of Wisconsin, Massachusetts, or New Hampshire and diagnosed from 198 to 200 at ages 20 to 79 years. All women reported on prediagnostic intake; a subsample of 4,881 reported on postdiagnostic intake. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 11.3 years from diagnosis, 7,780 deaths occurred, including 3,484 resulting from breast cancer. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs were estimated. Based on a quadratic analysis, moderate alcohol consumption before diagnosis was modestly associated with disease-specific survival (compared with nondrinkers, HR = 0.93 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.02], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.95], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.02], and 0.89 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.04] for two or more, three to six, seven to nine, and >/= 10 drinks/wk, respectively). Alcohol consumption after diagnosis was not associated with disease-specific survival (compared with nondrinkers, HR = 0.88 [95% CI, 0.61 to 1.27], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.49 to 1.32], 1.01 [95% CI, 0.55 to 1.87], and 0.83 [95% CI, 0.45 to 1.54] for two or more, three to six, seven to nine, and >/= 10 drinks/wk, respectively). Results did not vary by beverage type. Women consuming moderate levels of alcohol, either before or after diagnosis, experienced better cardiovascular and overall survival than nondrinkers. CONCLUSION: Overall alcohol consumption before diagnosis was not associated with disease-specific survival, but we found a suggestion favoring moderate consumption. There was no evidence for an association with postdiagnosis alcohol intake and breast cancer survival. This study, however, does provide support for a benefit of limited alcohol intake for cardiovascular and overall survival in women with breast cancer.",Adult Aged *Alcohol Drinking/adverse effects Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/*mortality/pathology Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/*mortality/prevention & control Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Massachusetts/epidemiology Middle Aged New Hampshire/epidemiology Odds Ratio Risk Assessment Risk Factors Survival Analysis Wisconsin/epidemiology

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to quantify associations of raw fruit and fruit juice consumption with BP by using cross-sectional data from the INTERnational study on MAcro/micronutrients and blood Pressure (INTERMAP) of 4680 men and women aged 40-59 y from Japan, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States. DESIGN: During 4 visits, 8 BP, four 24-h dietary recalls, and two 24-h urine samples were collected. Country-specific multivariate-controlled linear regression coefficients, including adjustment for urinary sodium excretion, were estimated and pooled, weighted by inverse of their variance. RESULTS: The average total raw fruit consumption varied from a mean +/- SD of 52 +/- 65 g/1000 kcal in the United States to 68 +/- 70 g/1000 kcal in China. Individual raw fruit intake was not associated with BP in pooled analyses for all countries or in participants from Western countries, although a positive association with diastolic BP was observed in East Asian participants (per 50 g/1000 kcal; 0.37 mm Hg; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.71). Positive relationships with diastolic BP were found for citrus fruit intake in Western consumers (per 25 g/1000 kcal; 0.47 mm Hg; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.81) and for apple intake in East Asian consumers (0.40 mm Hg; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.78). Among East Asian banana consumers, banana intake was inversely associated with diastolic BP (-1.01 mm Hg; 95% CI: -1.88, -0.02). Fruit juice intake, which was negligible in Asia, was not related to BP in Western countries.

23569324,Risk of colorectal cancer after diagnosis of endometrial cancer: a population-based study.,J Clin Oncol,Singh H and Nugent Z and Demers A and Czaykowski PM and Mahmud SM,Missing,"PURPOSE: Site-specific risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) among survivors of endometrial cancer (EC) is not known. The objective of the present study was to assess the risk of CRC (overall and subsite specific) among EC survivors. METHODS: A historical cohort study was performed by linking the Manitoba Cancer Registry and the Manitoba Health administrative databases. Each subject diagnosed with EC as her first cancer between 1987 and 2008 was age matched with up to five women with no history of invasive cancer on the index date (date of EC diagnosis). All subjects were followed up to the date of diagnosis of CRC or another cancer, death, migration, or study end point (December 31, 2009). Competing-risk proportional hazards models were used to compare the CRC incidence rates with adjustment for age, history of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, and socioeconomic status. There were three mutually exclusive (and competing) outcomes: CRC, another primary cancer, and death. RESULTS: A total of 3,115 women with EC and 15,084 without EC were followed up for a total of 145,502 person-years. Women diagnosed with EC at age </= 50 years had an increased risk of being diagnosed with CRC (all CRC: hazard ratio [HR] = 4.41; 95% CI, 1.47 to 13.26; right-sided CRC: HR = 7.48; 95% CI, 1.29 to 43.28). There was no increased risk of all CRC among women 51 to 65 years of age or those older than 65 years at the time of EC diagnosis. However, women 51 to 65 years of age at EC diagnosis had an increased risk of right-sided CRC (HR = 2.30; 95% CI, 1.05 to 5.01). CONCLUSION: This study suggests young women (age </= 50 years) with EC are at increased risk of CRC; risk of right-sided CRC is also increased in women 51 to 65 years old at EC diagnosis.",Adult Aged Cohort Studies Colorectal Neoplasms/*epidemiology Endometrial Neoplasms/*epidemiology Female Humans Incidence Manitoba/epidemiology Medical Record Linkage Middle Aged Registries Risk Assessment Risk Factors
23507996,"The effect of physicians' body weight on patient attitudes: implications for physician selection, trust and adherence to medical advice.",Int J Obes (Lond),Puhl RM and Gold JA and Luedicke J and DePierre JA,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Research has documented negative stigma by health providers toward overweight and obese patients, but it is unknown whether physicians themselves are vulnerable to weight bias from patients. PURPOSE: This study assessed public perceptions of normal weight, overweight or obese physicians to identify how physicians' body weight affects patients' selection, trust and willingness to follow the medical advice of providers. METHODS: An online sample of 358 adults were randomly assigned to one of three survey conditions in which they completed a questionnaire assessing their perceptions of physicians who were described as normal weight, overweight or obese. Participants also completed a measure of explicit weight bias (Fat Phobia Scale) to determine whether antifat attitudes are associated with weight-related perceptions of physicians. RESULTS: Respondents reported more mistrust of physicians who are overweight or obese, were less inclined to follow their medical advice, and were more likely to change providers if the physician was perceived to be overweight or obese, compared to normal-weight physicians who elicited significantly more favorable reactions. These weight biases remained present regardless of participants' own body weight. Inspection of interaction effects revealed opposing effects of weight bias between the obese/overweight and normal-weight physician conditions. Stronger weight bias led to higher trust, more compassion, more inclination to follow advice, and less inclination to change doctors when the physician was presented as normal weight. In contrast, stronger weight bias led to less trust, less compassion, less inclination to follow advice and higher inclination to change doctors when the physician was presented as obese. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that providers perceived to be overweight or obese may be vulnerable to biased attitudes from patients, and that providers' excess weight may negatively affect patients' perceptions of their credibility, level of trust and inclination to follow medical advice.","Adult Body Mass Index Female Health Behavior Humans Internal-External Control Male Outcome Assessment (Health Care) Overweight/prevention & control/*psychology Perception *Personnel Selection Physician's Role/*psychology *Physician-Patient Relations *Physicians, Primary Care/psychology/statistics & numerical data Questionnaires Trust United States"
23582238,Weight change at 12 months in users of three progestin-only contraceptive methods.,Contraception,Vickery Z and Madden T and Zhao Q and Secura GM and Allsworth JE and Peipert JF,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Concerns about weight gain may influence contraceptive use. We compared the change in body weight over the first 12 months of use between women using the etonogestrel (ENG) implant, the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) with women using the copper intrauterine device (IUD). STUDY DESIGN: This was a substudy of the Contraceptive CHOICE Project, a prospective cohort study of 9256 women provided no-cost contraception. Women who had been using the ENG implant, LNG-IUS, DMPA or copper IUD continuously for at least 11 months were eligible for participation. We obtained body weight at enrollment and at 12 months and compared the weight change for each progestin-only method to the copper IUD. RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 427 women: 130 ENG implant users, 130 LNG-IUS users, 67 DMPA users and 100 copper IUD users. The mean weight change (in kilograms) over 12 months was 2.1 for ENG implant users [standard deviation (SD)=6.7]; 1.0 for LNG-IUS users (SD=5.3); 2.2 for DMPA users (SD=4.9) and 0.2 for copper IUD users (SD=5.1). The range of weight change was broad across all contraceptive methods. In the unadjusted linear regression model, ENG implant and DMPA use were associated with weight gain compared to the copper IUD. However, in the adjusted model, no difference in weight gain with the ENG implant, LNG-IUS or DMPA was observed. Only Black race was associated with significant weight gain (1.3 kg, 95% confidence interval=0.2-2.4) when compared to other racial groups. CONCLUSIONS: Weight change was variable among women using progestin-only contraceptives. Black race was a significant predictor of weight gain among contraceptive users.","Adolescent Adult African Americans Cohort Studies Contraceptive Agents, Female/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Delayed-Action Preparations/administration & dosage/adverse effects Desogestrel/administration & dosage/adverse effects Drug Implants Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Intrauterine Devices, Medicated/adverse effects Levonorgestrel/administration & dosage/adverse effects Medroxyprogesterone Acetate/administration & dosage/adverse effects Missouri Progestins/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Prospective Studies Urban Health/ethnology Weight Gain/*drug effects/ethnology Young Adult"

Suicides and accidents have not been studied in these patients. This study sought to determine whether there is an excess of suicide and accidental deaths after HSCT, and to determine risk factors. METHODS: The incidence of suicidal and accidental death in patients after undergoing HSCT, standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and absolute excess risk (AER) of suicide and accidental deaths was determined, compared with the general European population. A case-control analysis was done to define factors associated with suicide and accidental deaths. Data were derived from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry, including 294,922 patients who underwent autologous or allogeneic HSCT from 1980 to 2009. RESULTS: The 10-year cumulative incidence of suicide and accidental deaths was 101.8 and 55.6 per 100,000 patients, respectively. SMR and AER of suicide after HSCT were 2.12 (P < .001) and 10.91, higher than in the European general population for 100,000 deaths, respectively. SMR and AER of accidental death were 1.23 (P < .05) and 2.54, respectively. In the case-control study, relapses were more frequent among patients who committed suicide after autologous HSCT (37% versus 18%; P < .0001). Chronic graft-versus-host disease was higher among patients who committed suicide after allogeneic HSCT (64% versus 37%; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: There is an excess of deaths due to suicide and accidents in patients after undergoing HSCT as compared with the European general population. Relapse was associated with more suicide and accidental deaths after autologous HSCT, and chronic graft-versus-host disease was associated with more deaths by suicide after allogeneic HSCT.","Accidents/psychology/*statistics & numerical data Adolescent Adult Aged Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Disease Progression Europe/epidemiology Female Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/psychology/*statistics & numerical data Humans Incidence Infant Male Middle Aged Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Suicide/psychology/*statistics & numerical data Young Adult"

The creation of a transplantable graft to permanently replace kidney function would address donor organ shortage and the morbidity associated with immunosuppression. Such a bioengineered graft must have the kidney's architecture and function and permit perfusion, filtration, secretion, absorption and drainage of urine. We decellularized rat, porcine and human kidneys by detergent perfusion, yielding acellular scaffolds with vascular, cortical and medullary architecture, a collecting system and ureters. To regenerate functional tissue, we seeded rat kidney scaffolds with epithelial and endothelial cells and perfused these cell-seeded constructs in a whole-organ bioreactor. The resulting grafts produced rudimentary urine in vitro when perfused through their intrinsic vascular bed. When transplanted in an orthotopic position in rat, the grafts were perfused by the recipient's circulation and produced urine through the ureteral conduit in vivo.","Animals Biomedical Engineering/methods Bioreactors Endothelial Cells/cytology Epithelial Cells/cytology Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells Humans Kidney/*pathology/*physiology Kidney Transplantation/*methods Male Perfusion Rats Rats, Sprague-Dawley Swine Tissue Engineering/*methods Tissue Scaffolds"

OBJECTIVE: To determine associations between CAD use during screening mammography and the incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive breast cancer, invasive cancer stage, and diagnostic testing. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Medicare program. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 67 to 89 years having screening mammography between 2001 and 2006 in U.S. SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) regions (409 459 mammograms from 163 099 women). MEASUREMENTS: Incident DCIS and invasive breast cancer within 1 year after mammography, invasive cancer stage, and diagnostic testing within 90 days after screening among women without breast cancer. RESULTS: From 2001 to 2006, CAD prevalence increased from 3.6% to 60.5%. Use of CAD was associated with greater DCIS incidence (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.17 [95% CI, 1.11 to 1.23]) but no difference in invasive breast cancer incidence (adjusted OR, 1.00 [CI, 0.97 to 1.03]). Among women with invasive cancer, CAD was associated with greater likelihood of stage I to II versus III to IV cancer (adjusted OR, 1.27 [CI, 1.14 to 1.41]). In women without breast cancer, CAD was associated with increased odds of diagnostic mammography (adjusted OR, 1.28 [CI, 1.27 to 1.29]), breast ultrasonography (adjusted OR, 1.07 [CI, 1.06 to 1.09]), and breast biopsy (adjusted OR, 1.10 [CI, 1.08 to 1.12]). LIMITATION: Short follow-up for cancer stage, potential unmeasured confounding, and uncertain generalizability to younger women. CONCLUSION: Use of CAD during screening mammography among Medicare enrollees is associated with increased DCIS incidence, the diagnosis of invasive breast cancer at earlier stages, and increased diagnostic testing among women without breast cancer.

Our objective was to evaluate if quality improvement (QI) methods could improve appropriate antibiotic prescribing in a setting without a formal antimicrobial stewardship program. METHODS: At a tertiary children's hospital, QI methods were used to rapidly implement the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society/Infectious Disease Society of America guideline recommendations for appropriate first-line antibiotic therapy in children with CAP. QI interventions focused on 4 key drivers and were tested separately in the emergency department and on the hospital medicine resident teams, using multiple plan-do-study-act cycles. Medical records of eligible patients were reviewed weekly to determine the success of prescribing recommended antibiotic therapy. The impact of these interventions on our outcome was tracked over time on run charts. RESULTS: Appropriate first-line antibiotic prescribing for children admitted with the diagnosis of CAP increased in the emergency department from a median baseline of 0% to 100% and on the hospital medicine resident teams from 30% to 100% within 6 months of introducing the guidelines locally at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and has been sustained for 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that QI methods can rapidly improve adherence to national guidelines even in settings without a formal antimicrobial stewardship program to encourage judicious antibiotic prescribing for CAP.","Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage Child Child, Hospitalized Child, Preschool Community-Acquired Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology Drug Prescriptions Emergency Service, Hospital Female Guideline Adherence/*statistics & numerical data Hospitals, Pediatric Humans Infant Length of Stay Male Physician's Practice Patterns/standards Pneumonia/*drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards Quality Improvement/*standards Risk Factors Severity of Illness Index Tertiary Care Centers Treatment Outcome United States"

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether we could decrease the number of laboratory tests ordered by presenting providers with test fees at the time of order entry in a tertiary care hospital, without adding extra steps to the ordering process. DESIGN: Controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: All providers, including physicians and nonphysicians, who ordered laboratory tests through the computerized provider order entry system at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. INTERVENTION: We randomly assigned 61 diagnostic laboratory tests to an ""active"" arm (fee displayed) or to a control arm (fee not displayed). During a 6-month baseline period (November 10, 2008, through May 9, 2009), we did not display any fee data. During a 6-month intervention period 1 year later (November 10, 2009, through May 9, 2010), we displayed fees, based on the Medicare allowable fee, for active tests only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We examined changes in the total number of orders placed, the frequency of ordered tests (per patient-day), and total charges associated with the orders according to the time period (baseline vs intervention period) and by study group (active test vs control). RESULTS: For the active arm tests, rates of test ordering were reduced from 3.72 tests per patient-day in the baseline period to 3.40 tests per patient-day in the intervention period (8.59% decrease; 95% CI, -8.99% to -8.19%). For control arm tests, ordering increased from 1.15 to 1.22 tests per patient-day from the baseline period to the intervention period (5.64% increase; 95% CI, 4.90% to 6.39%) (P < .001 for difference over time between active and control tests). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Presenting fee data to providers at the time of order entry resulted in a modest decrease in test ordering. Adoption of this intervention may reduce the number of inappropriately ordered diagnostic tests.","Adult Aged Baltimore Clinical Laboratory Techniques/*economics/statistics & numerical data Cost Control *Data Display Diagnostic Tests, Routine/*economics/statistics & numerical data *Fees and Charges Female Hospitals/*statistics & numerical data Humans Male Medicare Middle Aged Physician's Practice Patterns/*economics/statistics & numerical data Prescriptions/*economics/*statistics & numerical data United States"

Although cases of GBS have been reported following a wide range of vaccines, a clear association has only been established with the 1976 H1N1 inactivated influenza vaccine. METHODS: We identified hospitalized GBS cases from Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) from 1995 through 2006. The medical record of each suspected case was neurologist-reviewed according to the Brighton Collaboration GBS case definition; only confirmed cases were included in the analyses, and cases of Miller Fisher syndrome were excluded. Using a case-centered design, we compared the odds of vaccination in the 6 and 10 weeks prior to onset of GBS to the odds of vaccination during the same time intervals in all vaccinated individuals in the entire KPNC population. RESULTS: We confirmed 415 incident cases of GBS (including Brighton levels 1, 2, and 3) during the study period (>30 million person-years). Incidence peaked during the winter months. The odds ratio of influenza vaccination within a 6-week interval prior to GBS, compared with the prior 9 months, was 1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], .4-3.1). The risk in the 6-week interval compared to the prior 12 months for tetanus diphtheria combination, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide, and for all vaccines combined was 1.4 (95% CI, .3-4.5), 0.7 (95% CI, .1-2.9), and 1.3 (95% CI, .8-2.3), respectively.

BACKGROUND: Studies have evaluated predictors of delay in D2BT, highlighting system-related issues and patient demographic characteristics. Limited data exist, however, for nonsystem reasons for delay in D2BT. METHODS: We analyzed nonsystem reasons for delay in D2BT among 82,678 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention within 24 h of symptom onset in the CathPCI Registry from January 1, 2009, to June 30, 2011. RESULTS: Nonsystem delays occurred in 14.7% of patients (n = 12,146). Patients with nonsystem delays were more likely to be older, female, African American, and have greater comorbidities. The in-hospital mortality for patients treated without delay was 2.5% versus 15.1% for those with delay (p < 0.01). Nonsystem delay reasons included delays in providing consent (4.4%), difficult vascular access (8.4%), difficulty crossing the lesion (18.8%), ""other"" (31%), and cardiac arrest/intubation (37.4%). Cardiac arrest/intubation delays had the highest in-hospital mortality (29.9%) despite the shortest time delay (median D2BT: 84 min; 25th to 75th percentile: 64 to 108 min); delays in providing consent had a relatively lower in-hospital mortality rate (9.4%) despite the longest time delay (median D2BT: 100 min; 25th to 75th percentile: 80 to 131 min). Mortality for delays due to difficult vascular access, difficulty crossing a lesion, and other was also higher (8.0%, 5.6%, and 5.9%, respectively) compared with nondelayed patients (p < 0.0001). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, in-hospital mortality remained higher for patients with nonsystem delays. CONCLUSIONS: Nonsystem reasons for delay in D2BT in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients presenting for primary percutaneous coronary intervention are common and associated with high in-hospital mortality.","Aged Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary/adverse effects/*mortality Coronary Angiography Female *Hospital Mortality Humans Male Middle Aged Myocardial Infarction/mortality/*therapy Registries Retrospective Studies Time Factors"

METHODS: Multiple electronic databases were searched for healthy participant studies reporting fiber intake and incidence of first hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, published between January 1990 and May 2012. RESULTS: Eight cohort studies from the United States, northern Europe, Australia, and Japan met inclusion criteria. Total dietary fiber intake was inversely associated with risk of hemorrhagic plus ischemic stroke, with some evidence of heterogeneity between studies (I(2); relative risk per 7 g/day, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-0.98; I(2)=59%). Soluble fiber intake, per 4 g/day, was not associated with stroke risk reduction with evidence of low heterogeneity between studies, relative risk 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.01; I(2)=21%). There were few studies reporting stroke risk in relation to insoluble fiber or fiber from cereals, fruit, or vegetables. CONCLUSIONS: Greater dietary fiber intake is significantly associated with lower risk of first stroke. Overall, findings support dietary recommendations to increase intake of total dietary fiber. However, a paucity of data on fiber from different foods precludes conclusions regarding the association between fiber type and stroke. There is a need for future studies to focus on fiber type and to examine risk for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes separately.",*Dietary Fiber Fruit Humans Incidence Risk Stroke/*epidemiology/etiology Vegetables

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness and safety of 4 weeks of low-frequency rTMS to the left temporoparietal junction in a cohort of patients with bothersome tinnitus. DESIGN: Crossover, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: The study population comprised 14 adults aged between 22 and 59 years with subjective, unilateral or bilateral, nonpulsatile tinnitus of 6 months' duration or greater and a score of 34 or greater on the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). INTERVENTIONS: Low-frequency (1 Hz) 110% motor threshold rTMS or sham to the left temporoparietal junction for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The difference of the change in the THI score between active rTMS and sham rTMS. RESULTS: Active treatment was associated with a median reduction in THI score of 10 (range, -20 to +4) points, and sham treatment was associated with a median reduction of 6 (range, -24 to +12) points. The median difference in THI score between the change associated with active and sham rTMS was 4 (95% CI, -9 to 10; and range, -32 to +14) points. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Daily low-frequency active rTMS to the left temporoparietal junction area for 4 weeks was no more effective than sham for patients with chronic bothersome tinnitus. Possible explanations for this negative study include the failure of rTMS to stimulate deeper parts of auditory cortex within the sylvian fissure and more widespread cortical network changes not amenable to localized rTMS effects.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the associations between dietary patterns and risk of VMSs by using data from middle-aged women born between 1946 and 1951 in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of 6040 women with a natural menopause were followed up at 3-y intervals over 9 y. Dietary intake was assessed at baseline in 2001, and the presence of VMSs was assessed at baseline and follow-up. Factor analysis and generalized estimating equation models for binary repeated measures were performed. RESULTS: Six dietary patterns were identified from factor analysis: cooked vegetables, fruit, Mediterranean style, meat and processed meat, dairy, and high fat and sugar. A higher consumption of the fruit or Mediterranean-style diet was inversely associated with VMSs in a comparison of the top with the bottom quintile, with adjusted ORs of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.93; P-trend = 0.0009) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.92; P-trend = 0.0004), respectively. The high-fat and -sugar pattern increased the risk of VMSs in a comparison of the top with the bottom quintile, with an adjusted OR of 1.23 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.44; P-trend = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of a fruit or Mediterranean-style diet decreased the risk of reporting VMSs, whereas consumption of a high-fat and -sugar diet increased the risk of VMSs. These results may eventually lead to a basis for the development of dietary preventive measures for VMSs.","Australia Body Mass Index *Diet, Mediterranean Dietary Fats/*administration & dosage Dietary Sucrose/*administration & dosage Factor Analysis, Statistical Female Follow-Up Studies *Food Habits *Fruit Humans Life Style Longitudinal Studies Meat Products Menopause/physiology Middle Aged Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Socioeconomic Factors"
23605683,Trends in mammography screening rates after publication of the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations.,Cancer,Pace LE and He Y and Keating NL,Missing,"BACKGROUND: In November 2009, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued new recommendations regarding mammography screening. The Task Force recommended against routine screening for women ages 40 to 49 years and recommended biennial screening for women ages 50 to 74 years. The recommendations met great controversy in mass media and medical literature; whether they have had an impact on screening patterns is not known. The objective of this study was to determine whether the 2009 USPSTF recommendations led to changes in screening rates among women ages 40 to 49 years and ages 50 to 74 years. METHODS: The authors performed cross-sectional assessments of mammography screening in 2005, 2008, and 2011 using data from the National Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative, in-person, household survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. In total, 27,829 women ages >/= 40 years responded to the 2005, 2008, or 2011 surveys and reported about their mammography use. The primary outcome assessed was self-reported mammography screening in the past year. RESULTS: When adjusted for race, income, education level, insurance, and immigration status, mammography rates increased slightly from 2008 to 2011 (from 51.9% to 53.6%; P = .07) and did not decline within any age group. Among women ages 40 to 49 years, screening rates were 46.1% in 2008 and 47.5% in 2011 (P = 0.38). For women ages 50 to 74, screening rates were 57.2 in 2008 and 59.1 in 2011 (P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Mammography rates did not decrease among women aged >40 years after publication of the USPSTF recommendations in 2009, suggesting that the vigorous policy debates and coverage in the media and medical literature have had an impact on the adoption of these recommendations.",Adult Age Factors Aged Breast Neoplasms/ethnology/*prevention & control/*radiography Cross-Sectional Studies Early Detection of Cancer/*methods Educational Status Emigrants and Immigrants/statistics & numerical data Ethnic Groups/statistics & numerical data Female Humans Income Mammography/standards/*statistics & numerical data Mass Screening/methods/*statistics & numerical data Medically Uninsured Middle Aged Minority Groups/statistics & numerical data Practice Guidelines as Topic Self Report United States

The objective of this study was to determine the impact of a physician ending a code status discussion with a question (autonomy approach) versus a recommendation (beneficence approach) on patients' do-not-resuscitate (DNR) preference. METHODS: Patients in a supportive care clinic watched 2 videos showing a physician-patient discussion regarding code status. Both videos were identical except for the ending: one ended with the physician asking for the patient's code status preference and the other with the physician recommending DNR. Patients were randomly assigned to watch the videos in different sequences. The main outcome was the proportion of patients choosing DNR for the video patient. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients completed the study, and 74% chose DNR after the question video, whereas 73% chose DNR after the recommendation video. Median physician compassion score was very high and not different for both videos. All 30 of 30 patients who had chosen DNR for themselves and 30 of 48 patients who had not chosen DNR for themselves chose DNR for the video patient (100% versus 62%). Age (odds ratio = 1.1/year) and white ethnicity (odds ratio = 9.43) predicted DNR choice for the video patient. CONCLUSIONS: Ending DNR discussions with a question or a recommendation did not impact DNR choice or perception of physician compassion. Therefore, both approaches are clinically appropriate. All patients who chose DNR for themselves and most patients who did not choose DNR for themselves chose DNR for the video patient.

In this study, we examine the incidence of this condition in a United States population based setting, and assess patient and emergency department attributes associated with an increased likelihood of hospitalization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Emergency department visits with a primary diagnosis of priapism between 2006 and 2009 were abstracted from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed of patient and hospital characteristics of those admitted with priapism. RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2009 a weighted estimate of 32,462 visits to the emergency department for priapism was recorded in the United States, which represents a national incidence of 5.34 per 100,000 male subjects per year. The incidence of emergency department visits increased by 31.4% during the summer compared to the winter months. Overall 4,320 visits (13.3%) resulted in hospitalization/admission for further management. On multivariable analyses independent predictors of admission included Charlson comorbidity index score 3 or greater (OR 5.67, p <0.001), insurance status (Medicaid vs private OR 1.60, p = 0.001), hospital location (rural vs urban nonteaching OR 0.32, p <0.001), median ZIP code income (very high OR 0.65, p = 0.005), emergency department volume (very high vs very low OR 1.61, p = 0.004), sickle cell disease (OR 2.22, p <0.001) and drug abuse (OR 5.47, p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Emergency department visits for priapism are relatively uncommon and occur more frequently during the summer months. The majority of patients are treated and released expediently. Predictors of hospital admission included comorbidity profile, insurance, hospital location and emergency department volume.","Adult Emergency Service, Hospital Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Priapism/*epidemiology United States"

While previous studies showed no systematic impacts in the first 2 years post-reform, the impact on mortality in subsequent years has not been examined. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether duty hour regulations were associated with changes in mortality among Medicare patients in hospitals of different teaching intensity after the first 2 years post-reform. DESIGN: Observational study using interrupted time series analysis with data from July 1, 2000 to June 30, 2008. Logistic regression was used to examine the change in mortality for patients in more versus less teaching-intensive hospitals before (2000-2003) and after (2003-2008) duty hour reform, adjusting for patient comorbidities, time trends, and hospital site. PATIENTS: Medicare patients (n = 13,678,956) admitted to short-term acute care non-federal hospitals with principal diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), gastrointestinal bleeding, or congestive heart failure (CHF); or a diagnosis-related group (DRG) classification of general, orthopedic, or vascular surgery. MAIN MEASURE: All-location mortality within 30 days of hospital admission. KEY RESULTS: In medical and surgical patients, there were no consistent changes in the odds of mortality at more vs. less teaching intensive hospitals in post-reform years 1-3. However, there were significant relative improvements in mortality for medical patients in the fourth and fifth years post-reform: Post4 (OR 0.88, 95 % CI [0.93-0.94]); Post5 (OR 0.87, [0.82-0.92]) and for surgical patients in the fifth year post-reform: Post5 (OR 0.91, [0.85-0.96]). CONCLUSIONS: Duty hour reform was associated with no significant change in mortality in the early years after implementation, and with a trend toward improved mortality among medical patients in the fourth and fifth years. It is unclear whether improvements in outcomes long after implementation can be attributed to the reform, but concerns about worsening outcomes seem unfounded.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Female Hospital Mortality/*trends Hospitals, Teaching/*trends Humans Internship and Residency/legislation & jurisprudence/*trends Male Medicare/*trends Personnel Staffing and Scheduling/legislation & jurisprudence/*trends Time and Motion Studies United States/epidemiology Work Schedule Tolerance"

Warmer temperatures accelerate growth and reproduction of ectotherms, whereas these processes are slowed or halted in colder temperatures. Female blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus inhabiting the Chesapeake Bay, exhibit a seasonal migratory behavior that is closely tied with spawning and the release of larvae. To better understand reproductive activities of the migratory adult females, we examined two reproductive parameters of these crabs sampled monthly (April-December, 2006): the levels of vitellogenin (VtG) in the hemolymph and VtG expression in the hepatopancreas and ovary. The full-length cDNA of VtG (CasVtG-ova) has been isolated from the ovary. The putative CasVtG sequence found in the ovary is >99% identical to that of the hepatopancreas and is related most closely to the sequences reported in other crab species. In female C. sapidus, the hepatopancreas produces over 99% of the total VtG toward the ovarian development. Ovarian stages 2 and 3 in the sampled females are characterized by significant high levels of VtG in hemolymph and VtG expression in both the hepatopancreas and ovary. However, during the southbound migration in fall, females at ovarian stages 2 and 3 have decreased VtG levels, compared to those in spring and summer. The decreased vitellogenesis activity during the fall migration suggests seasonal adaptation to ensure successful spawning and the larval release.",Missing
23567264,"Dietary supplements and prostate cancer: a systematic review of double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials.",Maturitas,Posadzki P and Lee MS and Onakpoya I and Lee HW and Ko BS and Ernst E,Missing,"Dietary supplements are popular among patients with prostate cancer (PC). The objective of this systematic review was to critically examine double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of non-herbal dietary supplements and vitamins (NHDS) for evidence that prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were reduced in PC patients. Five databases were searched from their inception through December 2012 to identify studies that met our inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers using the Cochrane tool. Eight RCTs met the eligibility criteria and were of high methodological quality. The following supplements were tested: isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and glycitein), minerals (Se) or vitamins (vitamin D) or a combination of antioxidants, bioflavonoids, carotenoids, lycopenes, minerals (Se, Zn, Cu, and Mg), phytoestrogens, phytosterols, vitamins (B2, B6, B9, B12, C, and E), and other substances (CoQ10 and n-acetyl-l cysteine). Five RCTs reported no significant effects compared with placebo. Two RCTs reported that a combination of antioxidants, isoflavones, lycopenes, minerals, plant oestrogens and vitamins significantly decreased PSA levels compared with placebo. One RCT did not report differences in PSA levels between the groups. In conclusion, the hypothesis that dietary supplements are effective treatments for PC patients is not supported by sound clinical evidence. There are promising data for only two specific remedies, which contained a mixture of ingredients, but even for these supplements, additional high quality evidence is necessary before firm recommendations would be justified.",Acetylcysteine/pharmacology/therapeutic use Antioxidants/*pharmacology/therapeutic use *Dietary Supplements Humans Male Minerals/pharmacology/therapeutic use Plant Extracts/*pharmacology/therapeutic use Prostate-Specific Antigen/*blood Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy Trace Elements/*pharmacology/therapeutic use Vitamins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use

However, clinical trials that evaluated nut consumption on adiposity have been scarce and inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published, randomized nut-feeding trials to estimate the effect of nut consumption on adiposity measures. DESIGN: MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for relevant clinical trials of nut intake that provided outcomes of body weight, BMI (in kg/m(2)), or waist-circumference measures and were published before December 2012. There were no language restrictions. Two investigators independently selected and reviewed eligible studies. The weighted mean difference (WMD) between nut or control diets was estimated by using a random-effects meta-analysis with 95% CIs. RESULTS: Thirty-three clinical trials met our inclusion criteria. Pooled results indicated a nonsignificant effect on body weight (WMD: -0.47 kg; 95% CI: -1.17, 0.22 kg; I(2) = 7%), BMI (WMD: -0.40 kg/m(2); 95% CI: -0.97, 0.17 kg/m(2); I(2) = 49%), or waist circumference (WMD: -1.25 cm; 95% CI: -2.82, 0.31 cm; I(2) = 28%) of diets including nuts compared with control diets. These findings were remarkably robust in the sensitivity analysis. No publication bias was shown. CONCLUSION: Compared with control diets, diets enriched with nuts did not increase body weight, body mass index, or waist circumference in controlled clinical trials.","Adiposity/*physiology Body Composition Body Mass Index Body Weight Databases, Factual *Diet Humans *Nuts Obesity/prevention & control Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Waist Circumference"

Latin American and Caribbean countries are struggling to respond to increasing morbidity and death from advanced disease. Health ministries and health-care systems in these countries face many challenges caring for patients with advanced cancer: inadequate funding; inequitable distribution of resources and services; inadequate numbers, training, and distribution of health-care personnel and equipment; lack of adequate care for many populations based on socioeconomic, geographic, ethnic, and other factors; and current systems geared toward the needs of wealthy, urban minorities at a cost to the entire population. This burgeoning cancer problem threatens to cause widespread suffering and economic peril to the countries of Latin America. Prompt and deliberate actions must be taken to avoid this scenario. Increasing efforts towards prevention of cancer and avoidance of advanced, stage IV disease will reduce suffering and mortality and will make overall cancer care more affordable.

Our objective was to describe the types of errors occurring in the home medication management of children with cancer. METHODS: In a prospective observational study at 3 pediatric oncology clinics in the northeastern and southeastern United States, patients undergoing chemotherapy and their parents were recruited from November 2007 through April 2011. We reviewed medical records and checked prescription doses. A trained nurse visited the home, reviewed medication bottles, and observed administration. Two physicians independently made judgments regarding whether an error occurred and its severity. Overall rates of errors were weighted to account for clustering within sites. RESULTS: We reviewed 963 medications and observed 242 medication administrations in the homes of 92 patients. We found 72 medication errors. Four errors led to significant patient injury. An additional 40 errors had potential for injury: 2 were life-threatening, 13 were serious, and 25 were significant. Error rates varied between study sites (40-121 errors per 100 patients); the weighted overall rate was 70.2 errors per 100 patients (95% confidence interval [CI]: 58.9-81.6). The weighted rate of errors with injury was 3.6 (95% CI: 1.7-5.5) per 100 patients and with potential to injure the patient was 36.3 (95% CI: 29.3-43.3) per 100 patients. Nonchemotherapy medications were more often involved in an error than chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Medication errors were common in this multisite study of outpatient pediatric cancer care. Rates of preventable medication-related injuries in this outpatient population were comparable or higher than those found in studies of hospitalized patients.","Adolescent Ambulatory Care Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects Cancer Care Facilities Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies *Community Health Nursing Confidence Intervals Drug Administration Schedule Female *Home Nursing Humans Incidence Male Medication Adherence/*statistics & numerical data Needs Assessment Neoplasms/diagnosis/*drug therapy Patient Safety Prospective Studies Risk Assessment United States"
23699900,Impact of specific medical interventions in early childhood on increasing the prevalence of later intellectual disability.,JAMA Pediatr,Brosco JP and Sanders LM and Dowling M and Guez G,miami,"IMPORTANCE: For the past 100 years, medicine in industrialized nations has become increasingly focused on specific medical interventions designed to improve the health of individual patients. Substantial evidence suggests that broader improvements in public health, nutrition, and economic well-being are more salient than medical or surgical interventions for the remarkable decrease in infant and child deaths since 1900. Less is known about the impact of specific medical interventions on morbidity such as intellectual disability (ID). OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of medical interventions in early childhood on increasing the prevalence of later ID, as reported in the literature from 1950 through 2000. DESIGN: We reviewed the medical literature and other data from 1950 through 2000 to construct estimates of the condition-specific prevalence of ID over time. We further explored the existing literature to document historically relevant influences on condition-specific prevalence, including the introduction of effective interventions, the timing of these introductions, and the likelihood of their widespread use. SETTING: Twentieth century United States and Western Europe. PARTICIPANTS: Populations of children who received a life-saving intervention within the first 5 years of life and were evaluated for ID after 5 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Case-specific prevalence of ID from 1950 through 2000. RESULTS: Low birth weight is associated with approximately 10% to 15% of the total prevalence of ID. No other new medical therapies introduced during this period were associated with a clinically significant increase in ID prevalence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Previous research has shown that specific medical interventions, such as newborn screening for congenital thyroid deficiency and phenylketonuria, have decreased the prevalence of ID approximately 16% in the United States since 1950. These results suggest that other medical interventions, particularly the advent of intensive care technologies, have also increased the prevalence of ID.","Child Child, Preschool Critical Care/*methods/trends Europe/epidemiology Humans Infant Infant, Low Birth Weight Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature Infant, Premature, Diseases/epidemiology/etiology/therapy Intellectual Disability/epidemiology/*etiology Intensive Care, Neonatal/methods/trends Prevalence United States/epidemiology"
23633306,School-based programmes for preventing smoking.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Thomas RE and McLellan J and Perera R,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Helping young people to avoid starting smoking is a widely endorsed public health goal, and schools provide a route to communicate with nearly all young people. School-based interventions have been delivered for close to 40 years. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this review was to determine whether school smoking interventions prevent youth from starting smoking. Our secondary objective was to determine which interventions were most effective. This included evaluating the effects of theoretical approaches; additional booster sessions; programme deliverers; gender effects; and multifocal interventions versus those focused solely on smoking. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL, Health Star, and Dissertation Abstracts for terms relating to school-based smoking cessation programmes. In addition, we screened the bibliographies of articles and ran individual MEDLINE searches for 133 authors who had undertaken randomised controlled trials in this area. The most recent searches were conducted in October 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where students, classes, schools, or school districts were randomised to intervention arm(s) versus a control group, and followed for at least six months. Participants had to be youth (aged 5 to 18). Interventions could be any curricula used in a school setting to deter tobacco use, and outcome measures could be never smoking, frequency of smoking, number of cigarettes smoked, or smoking indices. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Based on the type of outcome, we placed studies into three groups for analysis: Pure Prevention cohorts (Group 1), Change in Smoking Behaviour over time (Group 2) and Point Prevalence of Smoking (Group 3). MAIN RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-four studies involving 428,293 participants met the inclusion criteria. Some studies provided data for more than one group.Pure Prevention cohorts (Group 1) included 49 studies (N = 142,447). Pooled results at follow-up at one year or less found no overall effect of intervention curricula versus control (odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.05). In a subgroup analysis, the combined social competence and social influences curricula (six RCTs) showed a statistically significant effect in preventing the onset of smoking (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.87; seven arms); whereas significant effects were not detected in programmes involving information only (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.00 to 14.87; one study), social influences only (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; 25 studies), or multimodal interventions (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.08; five studies). In contrast, pooled results at longest follow-up showed an overall significant effect favouring the intervention (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96). Subgroup analyses detected significant effects in programmes with social competence curricula (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.88), and the combined social competence and social influences curricula (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.87), but not in those programmes with information only, social influence only, and multimodal programmes.Change in Smoking Behaviour over time (Group 2) included 15 studies (N = 45,555). At one year or less there was a small but statistically significant effect favouring controls (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06). For follow-up longer than one year there was a statistically nonsignificant effect (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.02).Twenty-five studies reported data on the Point Prevalence of Smoking (Group 3), though heterogeneity in this group was too high for data to be pooled.We were unable to analyse data for 49 studies (N = 152,544).Subgroup analyses (Pure Prevention cohorts only) demonstrated that at longest follow-up for all curricula combined, there was a significant effect favouring adult presenters (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96). There were no differences between tobacco-only and multifocal interventions. For curricula with booster sessions there was a significant effect only for combined social competence and social influences interventions with follow-up of one year or less (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.96) and at longest follow-up (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.96). Limited data on gender differences suggested no overall effect, although one study found an effect of multimodal intervention at one year for male students. Sensitivity analyses for Pure Prevention cohorts and Change in Smoking Behaviour over time outcomes suggested that neither selection nor attrition bias affected the results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Pure Prevention cohorts showed a significant effect at longest follow-up, with an average 12% reduction in starting smoking compared to the control groups. However, no overall effect was detected at one year or less. The combined social competence and social influences interventions showed a significant effect at one year and at longest follow-up. Studies that deployed a social influences programme showed no overall effect at any time point; multimodal interventions and those with an information-only approach were similarly ineffective.Studies reporting Change in Smoking Behaviour over time did not show an overall effect, but at an intervention level there were positive findings for social competence and combined social competence and social influences interventions.","Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Health Promotion Humans *Program Evaluation Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic School Health Services/*standards Schools Smoking/*prevention & control"
23630201,"Self-reported conflicts of interest of authors, trial sponsorship, and the interpretation of editorials and related phase III trials in oncology.",J Clin Oncol,Bariani GM and de Celis Ferrari AC and Hoff PM and Krzyzanowska MK and Riechelmann RP,Missing,"PURPOSE: Growing participation by industry in cancer research has resulted in increased reporting of conflicts of interest (COI). We aimed to test any association between authors' conclusions and self-reported COI or trial sponsorship in cancer studies. METHODS: Editorials and related phase III trials published in six clinical oncology journals in the last 3.5 years were analyzed independently by two investigators who classified study conclusions according to authors' endorsement of the experimental therapy. Logistic regression multivariable models were used to assess predictors of favorable conclusions of editorialists and of phase III authors. RESULTS: From January 2008 to October 2011, 1,485 articles were retrieved: 150 phase III trials and 150 editorials were eligible. Among the phase III trials, 82 (54.7%) had positive results, and 78 (52.0%) were entirely or partially funded by industry. Any COI were disclosed in 103 phase III trials (68.7%) and in 71 editorials (47.3%). Multivariable analysis showed that phase III trial results were the only significant predictor for a positive conclusion by trial authors (odds ratio [OR], 92.2; 95% CI, 19.7 to 431.6; P < .001). Sponsorship did not predict for positive conclusion by phase III authors (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.3 to 2.5; P = .788). The only factor associated with positive conclusions by editorial authors was a positive conclusion by phase III trial authors (OR, 36.3; 95% CI, 6.8 to 194.2; P < .001). CONCLUSION: The interpretation of recently published phase III cancer trials by their authors or by editorialists was not influenced by financial relationships or industry sponsorship. Increased awareness of COI policies may have led to more integrity in cancer research reporting.","Authorship/standards Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic/standards/statistics & numerical data *Conflict of Interest Editorial Policies Humans Logistic Models Medical Oncology/*standards/statistics & numerical data Multivariate Analysis Neoplasms/diagnosis/*therapy Periodicals as Topic/*standards/statistics & numerical data Research Design/standards/statistics & numerical data Self Report"
23629613,"Effects of reduced juice allowances in food packages for the women, infants, and children program.",Pediatrics,Andreyeva T and Luedicke J and Tripp AS and Henderson KE,yale,"OBJECTIVES: In 2009, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) implemented revisions to the composition and quantities of WIC food packages. Juice allowances were reduced by approximately half. This report describes changes in purchases of 100% juice and other beverages among WIC participants after the WIC revisions. METHODS: Scanner data from a New England supermarket chain were used to assess juice and other beverage purchases among 2137 WIC-participating households during a 2-year period (N = 36 051 household-months). Purchased beverage amounts were compared before (January-September 2009) and after (January-September 2010) implementation of the revised WIC packages. Generalized estimating equation models were used. RESULTS: Before the revisions, WIC juice accounted for two-thirds of purchased juice volume among WIC households. After implementation of the revisions, WIC juice purchases were reduced on par with allowance changes (43.5% of juice volume, 95% confidence interval [CI] 41.9%-45.1%). This reduction was only partly compensated for by an increase of 13.6% (8.4%-19.0%) in juice purchases using personal and other non-WIC funds. In total, juice purchases declined by 23.5% (21.4%-25.4%) from an adjusted monthly total of 238 oz to 182 oz per household. WIC households increased purchases of fruit drinks by 20.9% (14.9%-27.3%) and other noncarbonated beverages by 21.3% (12.1%-31.2%) but purchased 12.1% (8.1%-15.0%) less soft drinks. CONCLUSIONS: After the WIC revisions, total purchases of 100% juice among WIC households declined by about a quarter, with little compensation occurring from non-WIC funds for juice and other beverages. The public health impact of the shift in beverage purchase patterns could be significant.","Beverages/economics/*statistics & numerical data Carbonated Beverages/economics/statistics & numerical data Child Child Welfare Child, Preschool Confidence Intervals Cross-Sectional Studies Databases, Factual Family Characteristics Female Food Assistance/*economics/legislation & jurisprudence *Fruit Humans Infant New England Poisson Distribution Policy Making Poverty Predictive Value of Tests Program Evaluation *Public Health Regression Analysis Women's Health"
23630286,Neural predictors of individual differences in response to math tutoring in primary-grade school children.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Supekar K and Swigart AG and Tenison C and Jolles DD and Rosenberg-Lee M and Fuchs L and Menon V,stanford,"Now, more than ever, the ability to acquire mathematical skills efficiently is critical for academic and professional success, yet little is known about the behavioral and neural mechanisms that drive some children to acquire these skills faster than others. Here we investigate the behavioral and neural predictors of individual differences in arithmetic skill acquisition in response to 8-wk of one-to-one math tutoring. Twenty-four children in grade 3 (ages 8-9 y), a critical period for acquisition of basic mathematical skills, underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI scans pretutoring. A significant shift in arithmetic problem-solving strategies from counting to fact retrieval was observed with tutoring. Notably, the speed and accuracy of arithmetic problem solving increased with tutoring, with some children improving significantly more than others. Next, we examined whether pretutoring behavioral and brain measures could predict individual differences in arithmetic performance improvements with tutoring. No behavioral measures, including intelligence quotient, working memory, or mathematical abilities, predicted performance improvements. In contrast, pretutoring hippocampal volume predicted performance improvements. Furthermore, pretutoring intrinsic functional connectivity of the hippocampus with dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices and the basal ganglia also predicted performance improvements. Our findings provide evidence that individual differences in morphometry and connectivity of brain regions associated with learning and memory, and not regions typically involved in arithmetic processing, are strong predictors of responsiveness to math tutoring in children. More generally, our study suggests that quantitative measures of brain structure and intrinsic brain organization can provide a more sensitive marker of skill acquisition than behavioral measures.","Brain Mapping/methods Child Female Hippocampus/metabolism Humans Intervention Studies Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods Male *Mathematics Memory, Short-Term/*physiology Problem Solving/*physiology Reproducibility of Results"
23633319,Oral evening primrose oil and borage oil for eczema.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Bamford JT and Ray S and Musekiwa A and van Gool C and Humphreys R and Ernst E,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin condition, which usually develops in early childhood. Many children outgrow this disorder as they reach secondary school age, and although It may improve with age, there is no cure. Constant itch makes life uncomfortable for those with this condition, no matter what age they are, so it may have a significant effect on a person's quality of life. Its prevalence seems to be increasing as populations move from rural locations to cities. Some people, who do not see an adequate improvement or fear side-effects of conventional medical products, try complementary alternatives to conventional treatment. This is a review of evening primrose oil (EPO) and borage oil (BO) taken orally (by mouth); these have been thought to be beneficial because of their gamma-linolenic acid content. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of oral evening primrose oil or borage oil for treating the symptoms of atopic eczema. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to August 2012: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), AMED (from 1985), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched online trials registers and checked the bibliographies of included studies for further references to relevant trials. We corresponded with trial investigators and pharmaceutical companies to try to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. We performed a separate search for adverse effects of evening primrose oil and borage oil in November 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled, parallel, or cross-over trials investigating oral intake of evening primrose oil or borage oil for eczema. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently applied eligibility criteria, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We pooled dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR), and continuous outcomes using the mean difference (MD). Where possible, we pooled study results using random-effects meta-analysis and tested statistical heterogeneity using both the Chi((2)) test and the I((2)) statistic test. We presented results using forest plots with 95% confidence intervals (CI). MAIN RESULTS: A total of 27 studies (1596 participants) met the inclusion criteria: 19 studies assessed evening primrose oil, and 8 studies assessed borage oil. For EPO, a meta-analysis of results from 7 studies showed that EPO failed to significantly increase improvement in global eczema symptoms as reported by participants on a visual analogue scale of 0 to 100 (MD -2.22, 95% CI -10.48 to 6.04, 176 participants, 7 trials) and a visual analogue scale of 0 to 100 for medical doctors (MD -3.26, 95% CI -6.96 to 0.45, 289 participants, 8 trials) compared to the placebo group.Treatment with BO also failed to significantly improve global eczema symptoms compared to placebo treatment as reported by both participants and medical doctors, although we could not conduct a meta-analysis as studies reported results in different ways. With regard to the risk of bias, the majority of studies were of low risk of bias; we judged 67% of the included studies as having low risk of bias for random sequence generation; 44%, for allocation concealment; 59%, for blinding; and 37%, for other biases. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Oral borage oil and evening primrose oil lack effect on eczema; improvement was similar to respective placebos used in trials. Oral BO and EPO are not effective treatments for eczema.In these studies, along with the placebos, EPO and BO have the same, fairly common, mild, transient adverse effects, which are mainly gastrointestinal.The short-term studies included here do not examine possible adverse effects of long-term use of EPO or BO. A case report warned that if EPO is taken for a prolonged period of time (more than one year), there is a potential risk of inflammation, thrombosis, and immunosuppression; another study found that EPO may increase bleeding for people on Coumadin(R) (warfarin) medication. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Noting that the confidence intervals between active and placebo treatment are narrow, to exclude the possibility of any clinically useful difference, we concluded that further studies on EPO or BO for eczema would be hard to justify.This review does not provide information about long-term use of these products.","Administration, Oral Adult Child Dermatitis, Atopic/*drug therapy Dermatologic Agents/*therapeutic use Eczema/*drug therapy Humans Linoleic Acids/*administration & dosage Plant Oils/*administration & dosage Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic gamma-Linolenic Acid/*administration & dosage"
23664627,Interest in over-the-counter access to oral contraceptives among women in the United States.,Contraception,Grossman D and Grindlay K and Li R and Potter JE and Trussell J and Blanchard K,ibisreproductivehealth,"BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence indicates that over-the-counter (OTC) access to oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) is safe and effective. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a nationally representative survey of adult women at risk of unintended pregnancy using a probability-based online panel. In November-December 2011, 2046 eligible women completed the survey. Weighted proportions were calculated, and logistic regression was used to identify covariates associated with support for and interest in using an OTC OCP. RESULTS: A total of 62.2% said they were strongly (31.4%) or somewhat (30.9%) in favor of OCPs being available OTC. A total of 37.1% of participants reported being likely to use OCPs if available OTC, including 58.7% of current users, 28.0% using no method and 32.7% using a less effective method. Covariates associated with a higher odds of reporting interest in using OTC OCPs were younger age; being divorced, being separated or living with a partner (versus married); being uninsured or having private insurance (versus public insurance); living in the south (versus northeast); and current use of OCPs or less effective methods, or nonuse of contraception (versus use of another hormonal method or intrauterine device). Among respondents who said they were likely to use OTC OCPs, the highest amount they were willing to pay was on average $20. CONCLUSIONS: US women are supportive of OTC access to OCPs, and many would obtain refills OTC or start using OCPs if they were available OTC.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors *Attitude to Health Contraception Behavior Contraceptives, Oral/*adverse effects/economics Drug Costs Female Health Care Surveys *Health Services Accessibility/economics Humans Insurance, Health Logistic Models Nonprescription Drugs/*adverse effects/economics Pregnancy Pregnancy, Unplanned Risk Single Person United States/epidemiology Young Adult"
23633313,Interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices for hospital inpatients.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Davey P and Brown E and Charani E and Fenelon L and Gould IM and Holmes A and Ramsay CR and Wiffen PJ and Wilcox M,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The first publication of this review in Issue 3, 2005 included studies up to November 2003. This update adds studies to December 2006 and focuses on application of a new method for meta-analysis of interrupted time series studies and application of new Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Risk of Bias criteria to all studies in the review, including those studies in the previously published version. The aim of the review is to evaluate the impact of interventions from the perspective of antibiotic stewardship. The two objectives of antibiotic stewardship are first to ensure effective treatment for patients with bacterial infection and second support professionals and patients to reduce unnecessary use and minimize collateral damage. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effectiveness of professional interventions that, alone or in combination, are effective in antibiotic stewardship for hospital inpatients, to evaluate the impact of these interventions on reducing the incidence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens or Clostridium difficile infection and their impact on clinical outcome. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE from 1980 to December 2006 and the EPOC specialized register in July 2007 and February 2009 and bibliographies of retrieved articles. The main comparison is between interventions that had a restrictive element and those that were purely persuasive. Restrictive interventions were implemented through restriction of the freedom of prescribers to select some antibiotics. Persuasive interventions used one or more of the following methods for changing professional behaviour: dissemination of educational resources, reminders, audit and feedback, or educational outreach. Restrictive interventions could contain persuasive elements. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCT), controlled before-after (CBA) and interrupted time series studies (ITS). Interventions included any professional or structural interventions as defined by EPOC. The intervention had to include a component that aimed to improve antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients, either by increasing effective treatment or by reducing unnecessary treatment. The results had to include interpretable data about the effect of the intervention on antibiotic prescribing or microbial outcomes or relevant clinical outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors extracted data and assessed quality. We performed meta-regression of ITS studies to compare the results of persuasive and restrictive interventions. Persuasive interventions advised physicians about how to prescribe or gave them feedback about how they prescribed. Restrictive interventions put a limit on how they prescribed; for example, physicians had to have approval from an infection specialist in order to prescribe an antibiotic. We standardized the results of some ITS studies so that they are on the same scale (percent change in outcome), thereby facilitating comparisons of different interventions. To do this, we used the change in level and change in slope to estimate the effect size with increasing time after the intervention (one month, six months, one year, etc) as the percent change in level at each time point. We did not extrapolate beyond the end of data collection after the intervention. The meta-regression was performed using standard weighted linear regression with the standard errors of the coefficients adjusted where necessary. MAIN RESULTS: For this update we included 89 studies that reported 95 interventions. Of the 89 studies, 56 were ITSs (of which 4 were controlled ITSs), 25 were RCT (of which 5 were cluster-RCTs), 5 were CBAs and 3 were CCTs (of which 1 was a cluster-CCT).Most (80/95, 84%) of the interventions targeted the antibiotic prescribed (choice of antibiotic, timing of first dose and route of administration). The remaining 15 interventions aimed to change exposure of patients to antibiotics by targeting the decision to treat or the duration of treatment. Reliable data about impact on antibiotic prescribing data were available for 76 interventions (44 persuasive, 24 restrictive and 8 structural). For the persuasive interventions, the median change in antibiotic prescribing was 42.3% for the ITSs, 31.6% for the controlled ITSs, 17.7% for the CBAs, 3.5% for the cluster-RCTs and 24.7% for the RCTs. The restrictive interventions had a median effect size of 34.7% for the ITSs, 17.1% for the CBAs and 40.5% for the RCTs. The structural interventions had a median effect of 13.3% for the RCTs and 23.6% for the cluster-RCTs. Data about impact on microbial outcomes were available for 21 interventions but only 6 of these also had reliable data about impact on antibiotic prescribing.Meta-analysis of 52 ITS studies was used to compare restrictive versus purely persuasive interventions. Restrictive interventions had significantly greater impact on prescribing outcomes at one month (32%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2% to 61%, P = 0.03) and on microbial outcomes at 6 months (53%, 95% CI 31% to 75%, P = 0.001) but there were no significant differences at 12 or 24 months. Interventions intended to decrease excessive prescribing were associated with reduction in Clostridium difficile infections and colonization or infection with aminoglycoside- or cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Meta-analysis of clinical outcomes showed that four interventions intended to increase effective prescribing for pneumonia were associated with significant reduction in mortality (risk ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97), whereas nine interventions intended to decrease excessive prescribing were not associated with significant increase in mortality (risk ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results show that interventions to reduce excessive antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients can reduce antimicrobial resistance or hospital-acquired infections, and interventions to increase effective prescribing can improve clinical outcome. This update provides more evidence about unintended clinical consequences of interventions and about the effect of interventions to reduce exposure of patients to antibiotics. The meta-analysis supports the use of restrictive interventions when the need is urgent, but suggests that persuasive and restrictive interventions are equally effective after six months.","Anti-Bacterial Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy/prevention & control Cross Infection/*drug therapy/prevention & control *Drug Resistance, Bacterial Humans Inpatients *Physician's Practice Patterns Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"
23633204,Mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy is associated with reduced educational outcomes in the offspring: 9-year follow-up of the gestational iodine cohort.,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,Hynes KL and Otahal P and Hay I and Burgess JR,utas,"CONTEXT: Severe iodine deficiency (ID) during gestation is associated with neurocognitive sequelae. The long-term impact of mild ID, however, has not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether children born to mothers with urinary iodine concentrations (UICs) <150 mug/L during pregnancy have poorer educational outcomes in primary school than peers whose mothers did not have gestational ID (UIC >/=150 mug/L). DESIGN: This was a longitudinal follow-up (at 9 years old) of the Gestational Iodine Cohort. Pregnancy occurred during a period of mild ID in the population, with the children subsequently growing up in an iodine-replete environment. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were children whose mothers attended The Royal Hobart Hospital (Tasmania) antenatal clinics between 1999 and 2001. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Australian national curriculum and Tasmanian state curriculum educational assessment data for children in year 3 were analyzed. RESULTS: Children whose mothers had UIC <150 mug/L had reductions of 10.0% in spelling (-41.1 points, 95% confidence interval [CI], -68.0 to -14.3, P = .003), 7.6% in grammar (-30.9 points, 95% CI, -60.2 to -1.7, P = .038), and 5.7% in English-literacy (-0.33 points, 95% CI, -0.63 to -0.03, P = .034) performance compared with children whose mothers' UICs were >/=150 mug/L. These associations remained significant after adjustment for a range of biological factors (maternal age at birth of child, gestational length at time of birth, gestational age at time of urinary iodine collection, birth weight, and sex). Differences in spelling remained significant after further adjustment for socioeconomic factors (maternal occupation and education). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that even mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy can have long-term adverse impacts on fetal neurocognition that are not ameliorated by iodine sufficiency during childhood.","Child Cognition Disorders/*etiology Cohort Studies Educational Measurement Female Follow-Up Studies Food, Fortified Health Promotion Humans Iodine/administration & dosage/*deficiency/urine Language Arts Learning Disorders/*etiology Longitudinal Studies Male *Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena Nutrition Policy Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications/*physiopathology Severity of Illness Index Tasmania"
23585144,Trends in immediate breast reconstruction across insurance groups after enactment of breast cancer legislation.,Cancer,Yang RL and Newman AS and Lin IC and Reinke CE and Karakousis GC and Czerniecki BJ and Wu LC and Kelz RR,upenn,"BACKGROUND: To improve access to breast reconstruction for mastectomy patients, the United States enacted the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act in January of 1999. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the impact of this legislation on patients with different insurance plans. METHODS: Women aged >/=18 years who underwent mastectomy for cancer were identified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2000-2009) and were classified according to their immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) status. Trends in rates of IBR were described for each insurance category. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, race, estimated household income, and Elixhauser comorbidity index was performed to evaluate the relation between insurance status and IBR. RESULTS: In total, 168,236 patients were identified who underwent a mastectomy during the study interval. Across the 10-year study period, rates of IBR increased 4.2-fold in Medicaid patients, 2.9-fold in Medicare patients, 2.6-fold in privately insured patients, and 2.1-fold in self-pay patients (P < .01). However, after adjustment for confounders, women without private insurance were less likely to undergo IBR compared with women who had private insurance (Medicaid: odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-0.37; Medicare: OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.49-0.58; self-pay: OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.37-0.50; other types of nonprivate insurance: OR, 0.64, 95% CI, 0.56-0.73). CONCLUSIONS: After the enactment of policy designed to improve access to IBR, Medicaid and Medicare patients experienced the greatest relative increase in rates of IBR. Although policy changes had the most impact on traditionally underserved populations, disparities still exist. Future studies should endeavor to understand why such disparities have persisted.","Adult Aged Breast Neoplasms/*economics/*surgery Female Health Services Accessibility/*economics/*legislation & jurisprudence Healthcare Disparities Humans Insurance Coverage/*legislation & jurisprudence Insurance, Health/*legislation & jurisprudence Logistic Models Mammaplasty/*economics Mastectomy, Modified Radical Medicaid Medicare Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Odds Ratio Patient Selection Time Factors United States"
23649656,Provision of spiritual support to patients with advanced cancer by religious communities and associations with medical care at the end of life.,JAMA Intern Med,Balboni TA and Balboni M and Enzinger AC and Gallivan K and Paulk ME and Wright A and Steinhauser K and VanderWeele TJ and Prigerson HG,harvard,"IMPORTANCE: Previous studies report associations between medical utilization at the end-of-life (EoL) and religious coping and spiritual support from the medical team. However, the influence of clergy and religious communities on EoL outcomes is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether spiritual support from religious communities influences terminally ill patients' medical care and quality of life (QoL) near death. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A US-based, multisite cohort study of 343 patients with advanced cancer enrolled from September 2002 through August 2008 and followed up (median duration, 116 days) until death. Baseline interviews assessed support of patients' spiritual needs by religious communities. End-of-life medical care in the final week included the following: hospice, aggressive EoL measures (care in an intensive care unit [ICU], resuscitation, or ventilation), and ICU death. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: End-of-life QoL was assessed by caregiver ratings of patient QoL in the last week of life. Multivariable regression analyses were performed on EoL care outcomes in relation to religious community spiritual support, controlling for confounding variables, and were repeated among high religious coping and racial/ethnic minority patients. RESULTS: Patients reporting high spiritual support from religious communities (43%) were less likely to receive hospice (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.20-0.70 [P = .002]), more likely to receive aggressive EoL measures (AOR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.14-6.06 [P = .02]), and more likely to die in an ICU (AOR, 5.22; 95% CI, 1.71-15.60 [P = .004]). Risks of receiving aggressive EoL interventions and ICU deaths were greater among high religious coping (AOR, 11.02; 95% CI, 2.83-42.89 [P < .001]; and AOR, 22.02; 95% CI, 3.24-149.58 [P = .002]; respectively) and racial/ethnic minority patients (AOR, 8.03; 95% CI, 2.04-31.55 [P = .003]; and AOR, 11.21; 95% CI, 2.29-54.88 [P = .003]; respectively). Among patients well-supported by religious communities, receiving spiritual support from the medical team was associated with higher rates of hospice use (AOR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.03-5.44 [P = .04]), fewer aggressive interventions (AOR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06-0.79 [P = .02]) and fewer ICU deaths (AOR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.80 [P = .02]); and EoL discussions were associated with fewer aggressive interventions (AOR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.63 [P = .01]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Terminally ill patients who are well supported by religious communities access hospice care less and aggressive medical interventions more near death. Spiritual care and EoL discussions by the medical team may reduce aggressive treatment, highlighting spiritual care as a key component of EoL medical care guidelines.","Adaptation, Psychological Advance Care Planning/statistics & numerical data Aged Cohort Studies Female Follow-Up Studies Hospice Care/statistics & numerical data Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplasms/diagnosis/mortality/*psychology/*therapy Palliative Care/psychology/*statistics & numerical data *Quality of Life/psychology Questionnaires *Religion Sampling Studies Severity of Illness Index Spirituality Terminal Care/psychology/*statistics & numerical data United States/epidemiology"
23650296,Pediatric hydrocarbon-related injuries in the United States: 2000-2009.,Pediatrics,Jolliff HA and Fletcher E and Roberts KJ and Baker SD and McKenzie LB,nationwidechildrens,"OBJECTIVE: To generate national estimates of hydrocarbon-related exposures occurring in children </=5 years of age who were treated in US emergency departments or called a regional poison control center. METHODS: This retrospective review compared hydrocarbon-related injuries that occurred from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2009, that were reported to the National Poison Data System and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System for children </=5 years of age. RESULTS: From 2000 through 2009, the National Poison Data System reported 65 756 actual calls to regional poison centers, and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System reported an estimated 40 158 emergency department visits for hydrocarbon-related injuries. Individuals involved were predominantly male and 1 to 2 years of age. Ingestion was the most common mechanism of injury, and most injuries did not result in hospitalization. The rate of emergency department visits and calls to poison centers decreased significantly (P < .0001) over the 10-year study period. Exposures to hydrocarbons demonstrated seasonal variation, with more occurrences in the summer months. CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of the two data sets illustrates a similar trend in hydrocarbon-related injuries in children. Although cases have declined, most likely due to existing prevention efforts, hydrocarbons are still a large source of preventable exposure and injury in children.","Child, Preschool Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data Female Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data Humans Hydrocarbons/*poisoning Infant Male Poison Control Centers/*statistics & numerical data Population Surveillance Retrospective Studies United States/epidemiology"
23649494,Cost consideration in the clinical guidance documents of physician specialty societies in the United States.,JAMA Intern Med,Schwartz JA and Pearson SD,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Despite increasing concerns regarding the cost of health care, the consideration of costs in the development of clinical guidance documents by physician specialty societies has received little analysis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the approach to consideration of cost in publicly available clinical guidance documents and methodological statements produced between 2008 and 2012 by the 30 largest US physician specialty societies. DESIGN: Qualitative document review. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Whether costs are considered in clinical guidance development, mechanism of cost consideration, and the way that cost issues were used in support of specific clinical practice recommendations. RESULTS: Methodological statements for clinical guidance documents indicated that 17 of 30 physician societies (57%) explicitly integrated costs, 4 (13%) implicitly considered costs, 3 (10%) intentionally excluded costs, and 6 (20%) made no mention. Of the 17 societies that explicitly integrated costs, 9 (53%) consistently used a formal system in which the strength of recommendation was influenced in part by costs, whereas 8 (47%) were inconsistent in their approach or failed to mention the exact mechanism for considering costs. Among the 138 specific recommendations in these guidance documents that included cost as part of the rationale, the most common form of recommendation (50 [36%]) encouraged the use of a specific medical service because of equal effectiveness and lower cost. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Slightly more than half of the largest US physician societies explicitly consider costs in developing their clinical guidance documents; among these, approximately half use an explicit mechanism for integrating costs into the strength of recommendations. Many societies remain vague in their approach. Physician specialty societies should demonstrate greater transparency and rigor in their approach to cost consideration in documents meant to influence care decisions.","Cost-Benefit Analysis Delivery of Health Care/*economics/organization & administration/standards/trends *Health Care Costs Humans Medicine *Practice Guidelines as Topic Qualitative Research Societies, Medical United States"
23561463,Does providing prescription information or services improve medication adherence among patients discharged from the emergency department? A randomized controlled trial.,Ann Emerg Med,McCarthy ML and Ding R and Roderer NK and Steinwachs DM and Ortmann MJ and Pham JC and Bessman ES and Kelen GD and Atha W and Retezar R and Bessman SC and Zeger SL,gwu,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine whether prescription information or services improve the medication adherence of emergency department (ED) patients. METHODS: Adult patients treated at one of 3 EDs between November 2010 and September 2011 and prescribed an antibiotic, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, cardiac, or respiratory drug at discharge were eligible. Subjects were randomly assigned to usual care or one of 3 prescription information or services intervention groups: (1) practical services to reduce barriers to prescription filling (practical prescription information or services); (2) consumer drug information from MedlinePlus (MedlinePlus prescription information or services); or (3) both services and information (combination prescription information or services). Self-reported medication adherence, measured by primary adherence (prescription filling) and persistence (receiving medicine as prescribed) rates, was determined during a telephone interview 1 week postdischarge. RESULTS: Of the 3,940 subjects enrolled and randomly allocated to treatment, 86% (N=3,386) completed the follow-up interview. Overall, primary adherence was 88% and persistence was 48%. Across the sites, primary adherence and persistence did not differ significantly between usual care and the prescription information or services groups. However, at site C, subjects who received the practical prescription information or services (odds ratio [OR]=2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 4.3) or combination prescription information or services (OR=1.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 3.1) were more likely to fill their prescription compared with usual care. Among subjects prescribed a drug that treats an underlying condition, subjects who received the practical prescription information or services were more likely to fill their prescription (OR=1.8; 95% CI 1.0 to 3.1) compared with subjects who received usual care. CONCLUSION: Prescription filling and receiving medications as prescribed was not meaningfully improved by offering patients patient-centered prescription information and services.","Adolescent Adult *Emergency Service, Hospital/organization & administration/statistics & numerical data Female Humans Male *Medication Adherence/statistics & numerical data Middle Aged *Patient Discharge/statistics & numerical data Patient Education as Topic/*methods *Prescriptions/standards/statistics & numerical data Young Adult"
23567927,Randomized controlled trial of the Medifast 5 & 1 Plan for weight loss.,Int J Obes (Lond),Shikany JM and Thomas AS and Beasley TM and Lewis CE and Allison DB,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: The Medifast 5 & 1 Plan (MD) is a portion-controlled, nutritionally-balanced, low-fat weight-loss plan. We studied the effects of MD compared with a reduced-energy, food-based diet (FB) on body weight, waist circumference, fat mass and other measures in adults. DESIGN: We conducted a two-parallel-arm, randomized, controlled trial comparing MD to FB over 52 weeks. A total of 120 men and women aged 19-65 years with BMI >/=35 and </=50 kg m(-2) were randomized to MD (n=60) or FB (n=60). Follow-up included a 26-week weight-loss phase and 26-week weight-maintenance phase. Anthropometric, body composition, biochemical and appetite/satiety measures were performed at baseline and at 26 and 52 weeks. An intention-to-treat, linear mixed models analysis was the primary analysis. RESULTS: Fifty MD subjects (83.3%) and 45 FB subjects (75.0%) completed the study on assigned treatment. At 26 weeks, race-adjusted mean weight loss was 7.5 kg in MD subjects vs 3.8 kg in FB subjects (P=0.0002 for difference); reduction in waist circumference was 5.7 cm in MD vs 3.7 cm in FB (P=0.0064); and fat mass loss was 6.4 kg in MD vs 3.7 kg in FB (P=0.0011). At 52 weeks, the corresponding reductions were 4.7 vs 1.9 kg (P=0.0004); 5.0 vs 3.6 cm (P=0.0082); and 4.1 vs 1.9 kg (P=0.0019) in MD and FB subjects, respectively. CONCLUSION: In obese adults, MD resulted in significantly greater reductions in body weight and fat compared with an FB diet for 1 year after randomization.","Adult Aged Body Weight Diet, Fat-Restricted Diet, Reducing/*methods *Energy Intake Female Humans Male Middle Aged Obesity/*diet therapy/epidemiology Patient Compliance/statistics & numerical data Patient Satisfaction/statistics & numerical data Program Evaluation *Satiation Treatment Outcome *Waist Circumference *Weight Loss Weight Reduction Programs/*methods"
23634714,Adulteration of purported herbal and natural sexual performance enhancement dietary supplements with synthetic phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.,J Sex Med,Campbell N and Clark JP and Stecher VJ and Thomas JW and Callanan AC and Donnelly BF and Goldstein I and Kaminetsky JC,Missing,"INTRODUCTION: Many products labeled ""herbal"" or ""all natural"" (herbal/natural) that claim to enhance sexual performance and imply use for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) are marketed as over-the-counter (OTC) dietary supplements. However, adulteration with undeclared phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors appears widespread. AIM: To assess the availability, cost, origin, categorical content, and adulteration with PDE5 inhibitors of purported herbal/natural OTC dietary supplements claiming to naturally enhance sexual performance. METHODS: Pfizer Global Security coordinated sample collection (all from convenience stores and filling stations in two U.S. metropolitan areas except for seven from U.S. Customs seizures) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Adulteration with synthetic PDE5 inhibitors. RESULTS: Ninety-one samples labeled as 58 distinct products and priced from $2.99 to $17.99 were evaluated. Origin/manufacture was claimed as United States (n = 62), apparently Asian (n = 15), and not clearly identified (n = 14). Although no sample claimed to include synthetic substances, 74 (81%) contained PDE5-inhibitor pharmaceutical ingredients, including tadalafil and/or sildenafil (n = 40, of which 18 contained >110% of the highest approved drug product strength) or PDE5-inhibitor analogs (n = 34). Pronounced heterogeneity of contents between samples within individual products indicated minimal quality control during manufacture. Labeling was inadequate (e.g., lacking lot number and/or expiry date) for 17 products (23 samples) and inconsistent between samples within a given product (e.g., in manufacturer, lot number, and/or expiry date) for seven of 17 products having multiple samples. Only 14 samples warned against concomitant nitrate use. CONCLUSIONS: Ethical pharmaceutical companies are concerned for an unsuspecting public when their products are counterfeited, mislabeled, and illegally offered for sale in an unsafe manner. Because of the dangers of adulteration with synthetic PDE5 inhibitors, absent safety warnings, and lack of quality or consistent manufacture, men with ED unknowingly risk their health by using OTC herbal/natural products that claim to enhance sexual performance.","Carbolines/analysis/therapeutic use Chromatography, Liquid Dietary Supplements/*analysis Drug Labeling Erectile Dysfunction/*drug therapy Humans Male Mass Spectrometry Nonprescription Drugs/*chemistry/therapeutic use Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors/*analysis/therapeutic use Piperazines/analysis/therapeutic use Purines/analysis/therapeutic use Sulfones/analysis/therapeutic use United States"

METHODS: Age-adjusted incidence rates (IRs), IR ratios (IRRs), and annual percent changes (APCs) in IRs were calculated for potentially HPV-related tumors diagnosed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program during 1978 through 2007. RESULTS: Overall IRs for preinvasive tumors were significantly higher than for invasive squamous cell tumors of cervix (IRR = 3.42), vulva (IRR = 1.87), and vagina (IRR = 1.19) and significantly lower for adenomatous cervical tumors (IRR = 0.43), and squamous cell tumors of penis (IRR = 0.64), anus (males, IRR = 0.53; females, IRR = 0.14), and head and neck (H&N) (males, IRR = 0.01; females, IRR = 0.02). Incidence of preinvasive squamous tumors of cervix, vagina, and penis rose rapidly over time and decreased for invasive neoplasms. The most rapid increases occurred for preinvasive (males, APC = 16.0; females, APC = 7.3) and invasive anal tumors (males, APC = 3.6; females, APC = 2.3). IR patterns were generally similar among evaluable racial/ethnic groups, with the exception of H&N invasive tumor IRs which increased exclusively among white males. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the opposing trends of preinvasive and invasive squamous tumors of cervix, vagina, and penis, preinvasive and invasive anal tumor IRs increased significantly over time by sex, age, and racial/ethnic groups. Successful HPV vaccination programs are needed to measurably reduce incidence of HPV-related neoplasms in the future, particularly for cancer sites with rising incidence rates for which effective screening modalities are limited.

The identification of gestational influenza as a risk factor for BD may have potential for preventive approaches. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that maternal influenza during pregnancy is related to BD among offspring. DESIGN: Nested case-control study of a population-based birth cohort from the Child Health and Development Study (CHDS). From January 1, 1959, through December 31, 1966, the CHDS recruited nearly all pregnant women receiving obstetric care from the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Plan, Northern California Region (KPNC). Data on treated maternal influenza from the CHDS were used. Potential cases with BD from the cohort were identified by database linkages of identifiers among the CHDS, Kaiser Permanente database, and a large county health care database; by a mailed questionnaire to the CHDS cohort with subsequent interviews; and from an earlier psychiatric follow-up study on this birth cohort. SETTING: The CHDS, Kaiser Permanente, and county health care databases. PARTICIPANTS: Cases of BD (n = 92) confirmed by structured research interviews and consensus diagnosis among the 214 subjects (48% of those ascertained) who participated and control subjects (n = 722) matched on date of birth, sex, and membership in KPNC or residence in Alameda County. EXPOSURES: Influenza. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Bipolar I or II disorder, BD not otherwise specified, or BD with psychotic features. RESULTS: We found a significant, nearly 4-fold increase in the risk of BD (odds ratio, 3.82 [95% CI, 1.58-9.24; P = .003]) after exposure to maternal influenza at any time during pregnancy. The findings were not confounded by maternal age, race, educational level, gestational age at birth, and maternal psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Maternal influenza may be a risk factor for BD. Although replication is required, the findings suggest that prevention of maternal influenza during pregnancy may reduce the risk of BD.","Adult Bipolar Disorder/*complications/epidemiology California/epidemiology Case-Control Studies Female Gestational Age Humans Influenza, Human/*complications/*congenital/epidemiology Maternal Exposure/adverse effects Models, Biological Odds Ratio Pregnancy *Pregnancy Complications, Infectious Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/psychology/*virology Prevalence Risk Factors"

BACKGROUND: Public reporting of 30-day mortality after PCI without clearly identifying the cause may result in operator risk avoidance and affect hospital reputation and reimbursements. Death certificates, utilized by previous reports, have poor correlation with actual cause of death and may be inadequate for public reporting. METHODS: All patients who died within 30 days of a PCI from January 2009 to April 2011 at a tertiary care center were included. Causes of death were identified through detailed chart review using Academic Research Consortium consensus guidelines and compared with reported death certificates. The causes of death were divided into cardiac and noncardiac and PCI and non-PCI-related categories. RESULTS: Of the 4,078 PCI, 81 deaths (2%) occurred within 30 days. Of these, 58% died of cardiac and 42% of noncardiac causes. However, only 42% of 30-day deaths were attributed to PCI-related complications. Patients with non-PCI-related, compared with PCI-related, death presented with a higher incidence of cardiogenic shock (15 of 47 [32%] vs. 2 of 34 [6%]; p < 0.01) and cardiac arrest (19 of 47 [40%] vs. 1 of 34 [3%]; p < 0.01). Death certificates had only 58% accuracy (95% confidence interval: 45% to 72%) for classifying patients as experiencing cardiac versus noncardiac death. CONCLUSIONS: Less than one-half of 30-day deaths are attributed to a PCI-related complication. Death certificates are inaccurate and do not report PCI-related deaths, which may represent a better marker of PCI quality.","Brain Death Brain Injuries/mortality *Cause of Death Coronary Vessels/injuries Death Certificates Heart Arrest/mortality/therapy Heart Failure/mortality/therapy Hemorrhage/etiology/mortality Humans Neoplasms/mortality Percutaneous Coronary Intervention/adverse effects/*mortality Renal Insufficiency/etiology/mortality Retrospective Studies Sepsis/mortality Shock, Cardiogenic/mortality/therapy Stents/adverse effects Stroke/mortality Thrombosis/etiology/mortality Time Factors Withholding Treatment/statistics & numerical data"

Given that MHT use is also associated with increased ovarian cancer risk, we tested whether ovarian cancer incidence rates changed after 2002. METHODS: Using the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries database (1995 to 2008; N = 171,142 incident ovarian cancers), we applied standard analytic approaches and age-period-cohort (APC) models to estimate ovarian cancer incidence rate changes before (1995 to 2002) and after (2003 to 2008) the WHI report. RESULTS: Among women age >/= 50 years, age-standardized ovarian cancer incidence declined by 0.8% per year (95% CI, -1.8% to -0.5% per year) before the WHI announcement; after the WHI report, the rate declined by 2.4% per year (95% CI, -2.5% to -2.2% per year). APC models confirmed an accelerated decline in ovarian cancer incidence after the WHI report, adjusted for age and birth cohort effects. This sudden change was notable among women most likely to have used MHT (ie, women age 50 to 69 years, white women, and residents of regions with highest MHT prescription frequency). The largest changes were found for the endometrioid histologic subtype. CONCLUSION: After a marked reduction in MHT use around 2002, ovarian cancer incidence rates demonstrated an accelerated decline, with the largest changes for endometrioid carcinomas. This strong temporal association, although not proving a causal role of hormones in ovarian carcinogenesis, suggests that future analytic research supporting cancer control efforts should clarify the role of hormonal exposures on the development and behavior of subtypes of ovarian cancer.",Estrogen Replacement Therapy/methods/*utilization Female Hormone Replacement Therapy/methods/*utilization Humans Incidence Menopause/drug effects Middle Aged Ovarian Neoplasms/*epidemiology United States/epidemiology

Past attempts to produce human NT-ESCs have failed secondary to early embryonic arrest of SCNT embryos. Here, we identified premature exit from meiosis in human oocytes and suboptimal activation as key factors that are responsible for these outcomes. Optimized SCNT approaches designed to circumvent these limitations allowed derivation of human NT-ESCs. When applied to premium quality human oocytes, NT-ESC lines were derived from as few as two oocytes. NT-ESCs displayed normal diploid karyotypes and inherited their nuclear genome exclusively from parental somatic cells. Gene expression and differentiation profiles in human NT-ESCs were similar to embryo-derived ESCs, suggesting efficient reprogramming of somatic cells to a pluripotent state.",Adult Animals Blastocyst/cytology Cell Fusion *Cell Line Cell Nucleus/genetics Cell Separation Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology Female Fetus/cytology Fibroblasts/*cytology Humans Macaca mulatta Mitochondria/genetics *Nuclear Transfer Techniques Oocytes/cytology/metabolism Skin/cytology
23699646,Effects of creative arts therapies on psychological symptoms and quality of life in patients with cancer.,JAMA Intern Med,Puetz TW and Morley CA and Herring MP,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Creative arts therapies (CATs) can reduce anxiety, depression, pain, and fatigue and increase quality of life (QOL) in patients with cancer. However, no systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the effects of CAT on psychological symptoms among cancer patients has been conducted. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effect of CAT on psychological symptoms and QOL in cancer patients during treatment and follow-up and to determine whether the effect varied according to patient, intervention, and design characteristics. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched ERIC, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, PubMed, and Web of Science from database inception to January 2012. Studies included RCTs in which cancer patients were randomized to a CAT or control condition and anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue and/or QOL were measured pre- and post-intervention. Twenty-seven studies involving 1576 patients were included. We extracted data on effect sizes, moderators, and study quality. Hedges d effect sizes were computed, and random-effects models were used to estimate sampling error and population variance. FINDINGS: During treatment, CAT significantly reduced anxiety (Delta = 0.28 [95% CI, 0.11-0.44]), depression (Delta = 0.23 [0.05-0.40]), and pain (Delta = 0.54 [0.33-0.75]) and increased QOL (Delta = 0.50 [0.25-0.74]). Pain was significantly reduced during follow-up (Delta = 0.59 [95% CI, 0.42-0.77]). Anxiety reductions were strongest for studies in which (1) a non-CAT therapist administered the intervention compared with studies that used a creative arts therapist and (2) a waiting-list or usual-care comparison was used. Pain reductions were largest during inpatient treatment and for homogeneous cancer groups in outpatient settings; significantly smaller reductions occurred in heterogeneous groups in outpatient settings. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Exposure to CAT can improve anxiety, depression, and pain symptoms and QOL among cancer patients, but this effect is reduced during follow-up.",Anxiety/etiology/prevention & control *Art Therapy Depression/etiology/prevention & control Fatigue/etiology/prevention & control Humans Neoplasms/complications/*psychology Pain/etiology/prevention & control *Quality of Life Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic

We assessed the accuracy of whole-body, post-mortem MRI for detection of major pathological lesions associated with death in a prospective cohort of fetuses and children. METHODS: In this prospective validation study, we did pre-autopsy, post-mortem, whole-body MRI at 1.5 T in an unselected population of fetuses (</=24 weeks' or >24 weeks' gestation) and children (aged <16 years) at two UK centres in London between March 1, 2007 and Sept 30, 2011. With conventional autopsy as the diagnostic gold standard, we assessed MRI findings alone, or in conjunction with other minimally invasive post-mortem investigations (minimally invasive autopsy), for accuracy in detection of cause of death or major pathological abnormalities. A radiologist and pathologist who were masked to the autopsy findings indicated whether the minimally invasive autopsy would have been adequate. The primary outcome was concordance rate between minimally invasive and conventional autopsy. FINDINGS: We analysed 400 cases, of which 277 (69%) were fetuses and 123 (31%) were children. Cause of death or major pathological lesion detected by minimally invasive autopsy was concordant with conventional autopsy in 357 (89.3%, 95% CI 85.8-91.9) cases: 175 (94.6%, 90.3-97.0) of 185 fetuses at 24 weeks' gestation or less, 88 (95.7%, 89.3-98.3) of 92 fetuses at more than 24 weeks' gestation, 34 (81.0%, 66.7-90.0) [corrected] of 42 newborns aged 1 month or younger, 45 (84.9%, 72.9-92.1) of 53 infants aged older than 1 month to 1 year or younger, and 15 (53.6%, 35.8-70.5) of 28 children aged older than 1 year to 16 years or younger. The dedicated radiologist or pathologist review of the minimally invasive autopsy showed that in 165 (41%) cases a full autopsy might not have been needed; in these cases, concordance between autopsy and minimally invasive autopsy was 99.4% (96.6-99.9). INTERPRETATION: Minimally invasive autopsy has accuracy similar to that of conventional autopsy for detection of cause of death or major pathological abnormality after death in fetuses, newborns, and infants, but was less accurate in older children. If undertaken jointly by pathologists and radiologists, minimally invasive autopsy could be an acceptable alternative to conventional autopsy in selected cases.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the lipid-lowering effects of phytosterol tablets and lifestyle change (LC) on top of red yeast rice (RYR) therapy in patients with a history of statin refusal or statin-associated myalgias. DESIGN: A total of 187 participants (mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], 154 mg/dL) took RYR 1800 mg twice daily and were randomized to phytosterol tablets 900 mg twice daily or placebo. Participants were also randomized to a 12-week LC program or usual care (UC). Primary end point was change in LDL-C at 12, 24, and 52 weeks. Secondary end points were effect on other lipoproteins, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, weight, and development of myalgia. RESULTS: Phytosterols did not significantly improve LDL-C at weeks 12 (P = .54), 24 (P = .67), or 52 (P = .76) compared with placebo. Compared with the UC group, the LC group had greater reductions in LDL-C at weeks 12 (-51 vs -42 mg/dL, P = .006) and 24 (-48 vs -40 mg/dL, P = .034) and was 2.3 times more likely to achieve an LDL-C <100 mg/dL (P = .004). The LC group lost more weight for 1 year (-2.3 vs -0.3 kg, P < .001). All participants took RYR and had significant decreases in LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol for 1 year when compared with baseline (P < .001). Four participants stopped supplements because of myalgia. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of phytosterol tablets to RYR did not result in further lowering of LDL-C levels. Participants in an LC program lost significantly more weight and were more likely to achieve an LDL-C <100 mg/dL compared with UC.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biological Products/*therapeutic use Dietary Supplements Double-Blind Method Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use Hypercholesterolemia/blood/*drug therapy *Life Style Lipids/*blood Male Middle Aged Phytosterols/*therapeutic use Treatment Outcome Young Adult"
23816024,Sleeping altitude and sudden cardiac death.,Am Heart J,Lo MY and Daniels JD and Levine BD and Burtscher M,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Mountain activities characterized by strenuous exercise in a hypoxic setting place unique demands on the body. The mortality rate associated with mountain activities is high, with sudden cardiac death (SCD) representing the most frequent of all nontraumatic deaths. We evaluated the possible effect of acclimatization in reduction of SCD during high-altitude sojourns. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study involving all deaths (N = 559) that occurred during mountain activities in Austria from 1985 through 1993. Baseline patient demographics, cardiovascular comorbidities, smoking history, family history of SCD, sleeping altitude, annual mountaineering frequency, and physical activity on the day of SCD were included in a questionnaire previously used in a pilot study. RESULTS: Data from 301 of 599 individuals without prespecified exclusions were available for analysis (79% of eligible cohort). Sudden cardiac deaths happened mostly around noon (29%), and mean altitude at which SCDs occurred was 1,710 +/- 501 m. When sleeping altitude was divided into quartiles (<700 m, 700-999 m, 1,000-1,299 m, and >1,299 m), the odds ratio for SCD on the first day at altitude when sleeping below 700 m was 5.7 (95% CI 2.8-11.6) as compared with sleeping above 1,299 m. CONCLUSION: For males >34 years, those with history of coronary artery disease and/or prior infarction, and those unaccustomed to physical activity at altitude, sleeping at moderate altitude before exercising at altitude may reduce the risk of SCD.","Adult *Altitude Altitude Sickness/*complications/mortality/prevention & control Austria/epidemiology Death, Sudden, Cardiac/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Middle Aged *Mountaineering Pilot Projects Questionnaires Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Sleep/*physiology"

We examined the associations of job strain and lifestyle risk factors with the risk of coronary artery disease. METHODS: We pooled individual-level data from 7 cohort studies comprising 102 128 men and women who were free of existing coronary artery disease at baseline (1985-2000). Questionnaires were used to measure job strain (yes v. no) and 4 lifestyle risk factors: current smoking, physical inactivity, heavy drinking and obesity. We grouped participants into 3 lifestyle categories: healthy (no lifestyle risk factors), moderately unhealthy (1 risk factor) and unhealthy (2-4 risk factors). The primary outcome was incident coronary artery disease (defined as first nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiac-related death). RESULTS: There were 1086 incident events in 743,948 person-years at risk during a mean follow-up of 7.3 years. The risk of coronary artery disease among people who had an unhealthy lifestyle compared with those who had a healthy lifestyle (hazard ratio [HR] 2.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.18-2.98; population attributable risk 26.4%) was higher than the risk among participants who had job strain compared with those who had no job strain (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06-1.47; population attributable risk 3.8%). The 10-year incidence of coronary artery disease among participants with job strain and a healthy lifestyle (14.7 per 1000) was 53% lower than the incidence among those with job strain and an unhealthy lifestyle (31.2 per 1000). INTERPRETATION: The risk of coronary artery disease was highest among participants who reported job strain and an unhealthy lifestyle; those with job strain and a healthy lifestyle had half the rate of disease. A healthy lifestyle may substantially reduce disease risk among people with job strain.","Adult Alcoholism/complications Coronary Artery Disease/*etiology/psychology Employment/*psychology Female Humans *Life Style Male Obesity/complications Questionnaires Risk Factors Sedentary Lifestyle Smoking/adverse effects Stress, Psychological/*complications"
23684971,Long-term enhancement of brain function and cognition using cognitive training and brain stimulation.,Curr Biol,Snowball A and Tachtsidis I and Popescu T and Thompson J and Delazer M and Zamarian L and Zhu T and Cohen Kadosh R,Missing,"Noninvasive brain stimulation has shown considerable promise for enhancing cognitive functions by the long-term manipulation of neuroplasticity. However, the observation of such improvements has been focused at the behavioral level, and enhancements largely restricted to the performance of basic tasks. Here, we investigate whether transcranial random noise stimulation (TRNS) can improve learning and subsequent performance on complex arithmetic tasks. TRNS of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key area in arithmetic, was uniquely coupled with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure online hemodynamic responses within the prefrontal cortex. Five consecutive days of TRNS-accompanied cognitive training enhanced the speed of both calculation- and memory-recall-based arithmetic learning. These behavioral improvements were associated with defined hemodynamic responses consistent with more efficient neurovascular coupling within the left DLPFC. Testing 6 months after training revealed long-lasting behavioral and physiological modifications in the stimulated group relative to sham controls for trained and nontrained calculation material. These results demonstrate that, depending on the learning regime, TRNS can induce long-term enhancement of cognitive and brain functions. Such findings have significant implications for basic and translational neuroscience, highlighting TRNS as a viable approach to enhancing learning and high-level cognition by the long-term modulation of neuroplasticity.","Acoustic Stimulation Adolescent *Cognition Female Humans *Learning Male *Mental Recall *Neuronal Plasticity *Noise Prefrontal Cortex/*physiology Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared Young Adult"
23674552,Body size and endometriosis: results from 20 years of follow-up within the Nurses' Health Study II prospective cohort.,Hum Reprod,Shah DK and Correia KF and Vitonis AF and Missmer SA,uiowa,"STUDY QUESTION: Is there a relationship between body mass index (BMI), body shape and endometriosis? SUMMARY ANSWER: Endometriosis is inversely associated with early adult BMI and may correlate with a peripheral body fat distribution. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The literature suggests an inverse relation between endometriosis and BMI, although few studies have specifically explored this association in depth. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Prospective cohort study using data collected from 116 430 female nurses from September 1989 to June 2011 as part of the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, METHODS AND SETTING: Cases were restricted to laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis. Weight at age 18 and height were reported at baseline, and current weight was updated every 2 years. Waist and hip measurements were first taken in 1993 and updated in 2005. Rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 5504 incident cases of endometriosis were reported during 1 299 349 woman-years (incidence rate = 385 per 100 000 woman-years). BMI at age 18 and current BMI were each significantly inversely associated with endometriosis (P-value, test for linear trend <0.0001). Both associations were stronger among infertile women. Obese infertile women with current BMIs of 35-39.9 kg/m(2) and >/= 40 kg/m(2) had a 55% (95% CI 0.30-0.67) and a 62% (95% CI 0.23-0.62) lower risk of endometriosis, respectively, compared with the low-normal BMI referent (18.5-22.4 kg/m(2)). Rates of endometriosis were nearly 3-fold higher in women with waist-to-hip ratios <0.60 (RR = 2.78, 95% CI 1.38-5.60) compared with those with waist-to-hip ratios between 0.70 and 0.79, although the sample size for this category was very small. LIMITATIONS AND REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although women with undiagnosed endometriosis certainly remain in the comparison population even in this prospective cohort study, the community prevalence of endometriosis in an asymptomatic population is very low. Moreover, the characteristics of this small proportion of undiagnosed cases are diluted among the >90 000 women accurately defined as being endometriosis-free and are, therefore, unlikely to impact on effect estimation. Although geographically diverse, the NHS II cohort is overwhelmingly Caucasian, which may limit generalizability to more ethnically diverse populations. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY: The results of this study suggest that endometriosis is inversely associated with early adult BMI and may correlate with a peripheral body fat distribution.",Adolescent Adult *Body Size Endometriosis/*epidemiology/pathology Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Nurses Odds Ratio Risk Factors *Waist-Hip Ratio

In particular, it is not clear whether sugar and artificially sweetened soda increase the risk. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We prospectively analyzed the association between intake of several types of beverages and incidence of kidney stones in three large ongoing cohort studies. Information on consumption of beverages and development of kidney stones was collected by validated questionnaires. RESULTS: The analysis involved 194,095 participants; over a median follow-up of more than 8 years, 4462 incident cases occurred. There was a 23% higher risk of developing kidney stones in the highest category of consumption of sugar-sweetened cola compared with the lowest category (P for trend=0.02) and a 33% higher risk of developing kidney stones for sugar-sweetened noncola (P for trend=0.003); there was a marginally significant higher risk of developing kidney stones for artificially sweetened noncola (P for trend=0.05). Also, there was an 18% higher risk for punch (P for trend=0.04) and lower risks of 26% for caffeinated coffee (P for trend<0.001), 16% for decaffeinated coffee (P for trend=0.01), 11% for tea (P for trend=0.02), 31%-33% for wine (P for trend<0.005), 41% for beer (P for trend<0.001), and 12% for orange juice (P for trend=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of sugar-sweetened soda and punch is associated with a higher risk of stone formation, whereas consumption of coffee, tea, beer, wine, and orange juice is associated with a lower risk.",Adult Aged Beverages/*adverse effects Cohort Studies Humans Kidney Calculi/*etiology Male Middle Aged Risk Factors Sweetening Agents/*adverse effects

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of vitamin C on SU levels in patients with gout. METHODS: Patients with gout and an SU level >0.36 mmoles/liter (6 mg/dl) were recruited. Twenty patients already taking allopurinol were randomized to receive an increase in the dose of allopurinol or to commence taking vitamin C (500 mg/day). Twenty patients who had not been taking allopurinol were randomized to start receiving either allopurinol (up to 100 mg/day) or vitamin C (500 mg/day). Levels of plasma ascorbate, creatinine, and SU were measured on day 0 and week 8. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the baseline SU level or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between those who received vitamin C and those who did not (for SU, mean +/- SEM 0.50 +/- 0.11 mmoles/liter [8.4 +/- 1.8 mg/dl] versus 0.50 +/- 0.09 mmoles/liter [8.4 +/- 1.5 mg/dl]; for eGFR, mean +/- SEM 65.5 +/- 3.5 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) versus 67.9 +/- 4.6 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) ). Among the randomized patients, 30% in the vitamin C group and 25% in the no vitamin C control group were receiving diuretics. In the patients receiving vitamin C, there was a significant increase between day 0 and week 8 in the plasma ascorbate level. The reduction in SU level over 8 weeks was significantly less in those patients receiving vitamin C compared to those who started or increased the dose of allopurinol (mean reduction 0.014 mmoles/liter [0.23 mg/dl] versus 0.118 mmoles/liter [1.9 mg/dl]; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A modest dosage of vitamin C (500 mg/day) for 8 weeks had no clinically significant urate-lowering effects in patients with gout, despite the fact that plasma ascorbate levels increased. These results differ from previous findings in healthy control subjects with hyperuricemia. The uricosuric effect of modest-dose vitamin C appears to be small in patients with gout, when administered as monotherapy or in combination with allopurinol.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Allopurinol/administration & dosage Ascorbic Acid/*administration & dosage/blood Creatinine/blood *Dietary Supplements Female Gout/*drug therapy Humans Male Middle Aged New Zealand Pilot Projects Treatment Outcome Uric Acid/*blood"

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of the 2009 recommendation on reported mammogram use in a population-based survey. DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of data collected in the 2006, 2008, and 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys. PARTICIPANTS: Women ages 40-74 years in the 50 states and Washington, DC who were not pregnant at time of survey and reported data on mammogram use during the 2006, 2008, or 2010 survey. MAIN MEASURES: Mammogram use was compared between women ages 40-49 and women ages 50-74 before and after the recommendation. We performed a difference-in-difference estimation adjusted for access to care, education, race, and health status, and stratified analyses by whether women reported having a routine checkup in the prior year. KEY RESULTS: Reported prevalence of mammogram use in the past year among women ages 40-49 and 50-74 was 53.2 % and 65.2 %, respectively in 2008, and 51.7 % and 62.4 % in 2010. In 2010, mammography use did not significantly decline from 2006-2008 in women ages 40-49 relative to women ages 50-74.

23684393,"The impact of marijuana use on glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance among US adults.",Am J Med,Penner EA and Buettner H and Mittleman MA,Missing,"BACKGROUND: There are limited data regarding the relationship between cannabinoids and metabolic processes. Epidemiologic studies have found lower prevalence rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus in marijuana users compared with people who have never used marijuana, suggesting a relationship between cannabinoids and peripheral metabolic processes. To date, no study has investigated the relationship between marijuana use and fasting insulin, glucose, and insulin resistance. METHODS: We included 4657 adult men and women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2005 to 2010. Marijuana use was assessed by self-report in a private room. Fasting insulin and glucose were measured via blood samples after a 9-hour fast, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated to evaluate insulin resistance. Associations were estimated using multiple linear regression, accounting for survey design and adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Of the participants in our study sample, 579 were current marijuana users and 1975 were past users. In multivariable adjusted models, current marijuana use was associated with 16% lower fasting insulin levels (95% confidence interval [CI], -26, -6) and 17% lower HOMA-IR (95% CI, -27, -6). We found significant associations between marijuana use and smaller waist circumferences. Among current users, we found no significant dose-response. CONCLUSIONS: We found that marijuana use was associated with lower levels of fasting insulin and HOMA-IR, and smaller waist circumference.","Adult Blood Glucose/*analysis/drug effects Cannabis/*metabolism Cholesterol, HDL/blood Female Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated/analysis Humans Insulin/*blood Insulin Resistance/*physiology Male Metabolic Syndrome X/*physiopathology Middle Aged Nutrition Surveys Prevalence Triglycerides/blood United States Waist Circumference/*drug effects"

Prolotherapy is an injection therapy for chronic musculoskeletal pain. We conducted a 3-arm, blinded (injector, assessor, injection group participants), randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of prolotherapy for knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: Ninety adults with at least 3 months of painful knee osteoarthritis were randomized to blinded injection (dextrose prolotherapy or saline) or at-home exercise. Extra- and intra-articular injections were done at 1, 5, and 9 weeks with as-needed additional treatments at weeks 13 and 17. Exercise participants received an exercise manual and in-person instruction. Outcome measures included a composite score on the Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC; 100 points); knee pain scale (KPS; individual knee), post-procedure opioid medication use, and participant satisfaction. Intention-to-treat analysis using analysis of variance was used. RESULTS: No baseline differences existed between groups. All groups reported improved composite WOMAC scores compared with baseline status (P <.01) at 52 weeks. Adjusted for sex, age, and body mass index, WOMAC scores for patients receiving dextrose prolotherapy improved more (P <.05) at 52 weeks than did scores for patients receiving saline and exercise (score change: 15.3 +/- 3.5 vs 7.6 +/- 3.4, and 8.2 +/- 3.3 points, respectively) and exceeded the WOMAC-based minimal clinically important difference. Individual knee pain scores also improved more in the prolotherapy group (P = .05). Use of prescribed postprocedure opioid medication resulted in rapid diminution of injection-related pain. Satisfaction with prolotherapy was high. There were no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Prolotherapy resulted in clinically meaningful sustained improvement of pain, function, and stiffness scores for knee osteoarthritis compared with blinded saline injections and at-home exercises.","Activities of Daily Living Adult Arthralgia/*drug therapy Female Glucose/*administration & dosage Humans Injections, Intra-Articular Knee Joint/*drug effects Male Middle Aged Osteoarthritis, Knee/*drug therapy Pain Measurement Range of Motion, Articular/*drug effects Severity of Illness Index Treatment Outcome"

Past attempts to produce human NT-ESCs have failed secondary to early embryonic arrest of SCNT embryos. Here, we identified premature exit from meiosis in human oocytes and suboptimal activation as key factors that are responsible for these outcomes. Optimized SCNT approaches designed to circumvent these limitations allowed derivation of human NT-ESCs. When applied to premium quality human oocytes, NT-ESC lines were derived from as few as two oocytes. NT-ESCs displayed normal diploid karyotypes and inherited their nuclear genome exclusively from parental somatic cells.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantitatively summarize the literature on egg consumption and risk of CVD, cardiac mortality, and type 2 diabetes by conducting a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. DESIGN: A systematic literature review was conducted for published studies in PubMed and EMBASE through March 2012. Additional information was retrieved through Google or a hand review of the reference from relevant articles. Studies were included if they had a prospective study design, were published in English-language journals, and provided HRs and 95% CIs for the associations of interest. Data were independently extracted by 2 investigators, and the weighted HRs and 95% CIs for the associations of interest were estimated by using a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 22 independent cohorts from 16 studies were identified, including participants ranging in number from 1600 to 90,735 and in follow-up time from 5.8 to 20.0 y. Comparison of the highest category (>/=1 egg/d) of egg consumption with the lowest (<1 egg/wk or never) resulted in a pooled HR (95% CI) of 0.96 (0.88, 1.05) for overall CVD, 0.97 (0.86, 1.09) for ischemic heart disease, 0.93 (0.81, 1.07) for stroke, 0.98 (0.77, 1.24) for ischemic heart disease mortality, 0.92 (0.56, 1.50) for stroke mortality, and 1.42 (1.09, 1.86) for type 2 diabetes. Of the studies conducted in diabetic patients, the pooled HR (95% CI) was 1.69 (1.09, 2.62) for overall CVD. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that egg consumption is not associated with the risk of CVD and cardiac mortality in the general population. However, egg consumption may be associated with an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes among the general population and CVD comorbidity among diabetic patients.","Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology/*mortality Databases, Factual Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/etiology/*mortality Eggs/*adverse effects Humans Incidence Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Risk Factors"

METHODS AND RESULTS: Athletes with ICDs (age, 10-60 years) participating in organized (n=328) or high-risk (n=44) sports were recruited. Sports-related and clinical data were obtained by phone interview and medical records. Follow-up occurred every 6 months. ICD shock data and clinical outcomes were adjudicated by 2 electrophysiologists. Median age was 33 years (89 subjects <20 years of age); 33% were female. Sixty were competitive athletes (varsity/junior varsity/traveling team). A pre-ICD history of ventricular arrhythmia was present in 42%. Running, basketball, and soccer were the most common sports. Over a median 31-month (interquartile range, 21-46 months) follow-up, there were no occurrences of either primary end point-death or resuscitated arrest or arrhythmia- or shock-related injury-during sports. There were 49 shocks in 37 participants (10% of study population) during competition/practice, 39 shocks in 29 participants (8%) during other physical activity, and 33 shocks in 24 participants (6%) at rest. In 8 ventricular arrhythmia episodes (device defined), multiple shocks were received: 1 at rest, 4 during competition/practice, and 3 during other physical activity. Ultimately, the ICD terminated all episodes. Freedom from lead malfunction was 97% at 5 years (from implantation) and 90% at 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Many athletes with ICDs can engage in vigorous and competitive sports without physical injury or failure to terminate the arrhythmia despite the occurrence of both inappropriate and appropriate shocks. These data provide a basis for more informed physician and patient decision making in terms of sports participation for athletes with ICDs.","Adolescent Adult *Athletes Athletic Injuries/*epidemiology/prevention & control Child Defibrillators, Implantable/adverse effects/*standards Female Humans Internationality Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies *Registries Risk Factors Sports/*standards Young Adult"

METHODS: Prospective cohort and case-control studies providing risk and precision estimates relating PD to exposure to pesticides or solvents or to proxies of exposure were considered eligible. The heterogeneity in risk estimates associated with objective study quality was also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 104 studies/3,087 citations fulfilled inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. In prospective studies, study quality was not a source of heterogeneity. PD was associated with farming and the association with pesticides was highly significant in the studies in which PD diagnosis was self-reported. In case-control studies, study quality appeared to be a source of heterogeneity in risk estimates for some exposures. Higher study quality was frequently associated with a reduction in heterogeneity. In high-quality case-control studies, PD risk was increased by exposure to any-type pesticides, herbicides, and solvents. Exposure to paraquat or maneb/mancozeb was associated with about a 2-fold increase in risk. In high-quality case-control studies including an appreciable number of cases (>200), heterogeneity remained significantly high (>40%) only for insecticides, organochlorines, organophosphates, and farming; also, the risk associated with rural living was found to be significant. CONCLUSIONS: The literature supports the hypothesis that exposure to pesticides or solvents is a risk factor for PD. Further prospective and high-quality case-control studies are required to substantiate a cause-effect relationship.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the proportion of marijuana ingestions by young children who sought care at a children's hospital in Colorado before and after modification of drug enforcement laws in October 2009 regarding medical marijuana possession. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2011. SETTING: Tertiary-care children's hospital emergency department in Colorado. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1378 patients younger than 12 years evaluated for unintentional ingestions: 790 patients before September 30, 2009, and 588 patients after October 1, 2009. MAIN EXPOSURE: Marijuana ingestion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Marijuana exposure visits, marijuana source, symptoms, and patient disposition. RESULTS: The proportion of ingestion visits in patients younger than 12 years (age range, 8 months to 12 years)that were related to marijuana exposure increased after September 30, 2009, from 0 of 790 (0%; 95% CI, 0%-0.6%) to 14 of 588 (2.4%; 95% CI, 1.4%-4.0%) (P < .001). Nine patients had lethargy, 1 had ataxia, and 1 had respiratory insufficiency. Eight patients were admitted, 2 to the intensive care unit. Eight of the 14 cases involved medical marijuana, and 7 of these exposures were from food products. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We found a new appearance of unintentional marijuana ingestions by young children after modification of drug enforcement laws for marijuana possession in Colorado. The consequences of unintentional marijuana exposure in children should be part of the ongoing debate on legalizing marijuana.","Accidents/*statistics & numerical data Cannabis/*poisoning Child Child, Preschool Colorado/epidemiology Emergency Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical data Female Hospitals, Pediatric/statistics & numerical data Humans Infant *Legislation, Drug Male Phytotherapy/*adverse effects Plant Preparations/*poisoning Retrospective Studies Risk Factors"

We assessed the efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, antibody persistence, and immunological correlates of an inactivated alum-adjuvant EV71 vaccine. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. Healthy children aged 6-35 months from four centres in China were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive vaccine or alum-adjuvant placebo at day 0 and 28, according to a randomisation list (block size 30) generated by an independent statistician. Investigators and participants and their guardians were masked to the assignment. Primary endpoints were EV71-associated hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and EV71-associated disease during the surveillance period from day 56 to month 14, analysed in the per-protocol population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01508247. FINDINGS: 10,245 participants were enrolled and assigned: 5120 to vaccine versus 5125 to placebo. 4907 (with three cases of EV71-associated HFMD and eight cases of EV71-associated disease) versus 4939 (with 30 cases of EV71-associated HFMD and 41 cases of EV71-associated disease) were included in the primary efficacy analysis. Vaccine efficacy was 90.0% (95% CI 67.1-96.9) against EV71-associated HFMD (p=0.0001) and 80.4% (95% CI 58.2-90.8) against EV71-associated disease (p<0.0001).

23676424,Trends in sugar-sweetened beverage consumption among youth and adults in the United States: 1999-2010.,Am J Clin Nutr,Kit BK and Fakhouri TH and Park S and Nielsen SJ and Ogden CL,cdc,"BACKGROUND: Reducing sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is a recommended strategy to promote optimal health. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to describe trends in SSB consumption among youth and adults in the United States. DESIGN: We analyzed energy intake from SSBs among 22,367 youth aged 2-19 y and 29,133 adults aged >/=20 y who participated in a 24-h dietary recall as part of NHANES, a nationally representative sample of the US population with a cross-sectional design, between 1999 and 2010. SSBs included soda, fruit drinks, sports and energy drinks, sweetened coffee and tea, and other sweetened beverages. Patterns of SSB consumption, including location of consumption and meal occasion associated with consumption, were also examined. RESULTS: In 2009-2010, youth consumed a mean (+/-SE) of 155 +/- 7 kcal/d from SSBs, and adults consumed an age-adjusted mean (+/-SE) of 151 +/- 5 kcal/d from SSBs--a decrease from 1999 to 2000 of 68 kcal/d and 45 kcal/d, respectively (P-trend < 0.001 for each). In 2009-2010, SSBs contributed 8.0% +/- 0.4% and 6.9% +/- 0.2% of daily energy intake among youth and adults, respectively, which reflected a decrease compared with 1999-2000 (P-trend < 0.001 for both). Decreases in SSB consumption, both in the home and away from home and also with both meals and snacks, occurred over the 12-y study duration (P-trend < 0.01 for each).

23726390,Vascular and upper gastrointestinal effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: meta-analyses of individual participant data from randomised trials.,Lancet,Bhala N and Emberson J and Merhi A and Abramson S and Arber N and Baron JA and Bombardier C and Cannon C and Farkouh ME and FitzGerald GA and Goss P and Halls H and Hawk E and Hawkey C and Hennekens C and Hochberg M and Holland LE and Kearney PM and Laine L and Lanas A and Lance P and Laupacis A and Oates J and Patrono C and Schnitzer TJ and Solomon S and Tugwell P and Wilson K and Wittes J and Baigent C,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The vascular and gastrointestinal effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs) and traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (tNSAIDs), are not well characterised, particularly in patients at increased risk of vascular disease. We aimed to provide such information through meta-analyses of randomised trials. METHODS: We undertook meta-analyses of 280 trials of NSAIDs versus placebo (124,513 participants, 68,342 person-years) and 474 trials of one NSAID versus another NSAID (229,296 participants, 165,456 person-years). The main outcomes were major vascular events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death); major coronary events (non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death); stroke; mortality; heart failure; and upper gastrointestinal complications (perforation, obstruction, or bleed). FINDINGS: Major vascular events were increased by about a third by a coxib (rate ratio [RR] 1.37, 95% CI 1.14-1.66; p=0.0009) or diclofenac (1.41, 1.12-1.78; p=0.0036), chiefly due to an increase in major coronary events (coxibs 1.76, 1.31-2.37; p=0.0001; diclofenac 1.70, 1.19-2.41; p=0.0032). Ibuprofen also significantly increased major coronary events (2.22, 1.10-4.48; p=0.0253), but not major vascular events (1.44, 0.89-2.33). Compared with placebo, of 1000 patients allocated to a coxib or diclofenac for a year, three more had major vascular events, one of which was fatal. Naproxen did not significantly increase major vascular events (0.93, 0.69-1.27). Vascular death was increased significantly by coxibs (1.58, 99% CI 1.00-2.49; p=0.0103) and diclofenac (1.65, 0.95-2.85, p=0.0187), non-significantly by ibuprofen (1.90, 0.56-6.41; p=0.17), but not by naproxen (1.08, 0.48-2.47, p=0.80). The proportional effects on major vascular events were independent of baseline characteristics, including vascular risk. Heart failure risk was roughly doubled by all NSAIDs. All NSAID regimens increased upper gastrointestinal complications (coxibs 1.81, 1.17-2.81, p=0.0070; diclofenac 1.89, 1.16-3.09, p=0.0106; ibuprofen 3.97, 2.22-7.10, p<0.0001; and naproxen 4.22, 2.71-6.56, p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: The vascular risks of high-dose diclofenac, and possibly ibuprofen, are comparable to coxibs, whereas high-dose naproxen is associated with less vascular risk than other NSAIDs. Although NSAIDs increase vascular and gastrointestinal risks, the size of these risks can be predicted, which could help guide clinical decision making.

23752669,Effect of weight loss on the severity of psoriasis: a randomized clinical study.,JAMA Dermatol,Jensen P and Zachariae C and Christensen R and Geiker NR and Schaadt BK and Stender S and Hansen PR and Astrup A and Skov L,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Psoriasis is associated with adiposity and weight gain increases the severity of psoriasis and the risk of incident psoriasis. Therefore, we aimed to measure the effect of weight reduction on the severity of psoriasis in obese patients with psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of weight reduction on the severity of psoriasis in overweight patients. DESIGN: Sixty obese patients with psoriasis from our dermatology outpatient clinic were enrolled in a prospective randomized clinical trial in which they were allocated to a control group or an intervention group. SETTING: University hospital outpatient dermatology clinic. PARTICIPANTS: We included 60 of 69 eligible overweight patients with psoriasis (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], 27-40; aged 25-71 years). INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group received a low-energy diet (LED) (800-1000 kcal/d) for 8 weeks to induce weight loss, followed by 8 weeks of reintroduction of normal food intake, reaching 1200 kcal/d. The control group was instructed to continue eating ordinary healthy foods. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) after 16 weeks, with Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) as a secondary end point. RESULTS: The median PASI for all patients was 5.4 (interquartile range, 3.8-7.6) at baseline. At week 16, the mean body weight loss was 15.4 kg (95% CI, 12.3-18.5 kg; P < .001) greater in the intervention group than in the control group. The corresponding mean differences in PASI and DLQI, also in favor of the LED group, were -2.0 (95% CI, 4.1 to -0.1; P = .06) and -2.0 (95% CI, -3.6 to -0.3; P = .02), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment with an LED showed a trend in favor of clinically important PASI improvement and a significant reduction in DLQI in overweight patients with psoriasis.

23697707,Blood type diets lack supporting evidence: a systematic review.,Am J Clin Nutr,Cusack L and De Buck E and Compernolle V and Vandekerckhove P,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Diets that are based on the ABO blood group system have been promoted over the past decade and claim to improve health and decrease risk of disease. To our knowledge, the evidence to support the effectiveness of blood type diets has not previously been assessed in the scientific literature. OBJECTIVE: In this current systematic review, published studies that presented data related to blood type diets were identified and critically appraised by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. DESIGN: A systematic search was performed to answer the following question: In humans grouped according to blood type, does adherence to a specific diet improve health and/or decrease risk of disease compared with nonadherence to the diet? The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase were systematically searched by using sensitive search strategies. RESULTS: Sixteen articles were identified from a total of 1415 screened references, with only one article that was considered eligible according to the selection criteria. The identified article studied the variation between LDL-cholesterol responses of different MNS blood types to a low-fat diet. However, the study did not directly answer the current question. No studies that showed the health effects of ABO blood type diets were identified. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence currently exists to validate the purported health benefits of blood type diets. To validate these claims, studies are required that compare the health outcomes between participants adhering to a particular blood type diet (experimental group) and participants continuing a standard diet (control group) within a particular blood type population.","*ABO Blood-Group System Databases, Factual Diet/*trends Humans Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"
23819576,Common prescription medication use and erectile dysfunction: results from the Boston Area Community Health (BACH) survey.,BJU Int,Kupelian V and Hall SA and McKinlay JB,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of erectile dysfunction (ED) with commonly used medications including antihypertensive treatment (AHT), psychoactive medication and pain and anti-inflammatory medication. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The Boston Area Community Health (BACH) survey used a multistage stratified design to recruit a random sample of 2301 men aged 30-79 years. ED was assessed using the five-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). Prescription medications, captured using a combination of drug inventory and self-report with a prompt by indication, included in this analysis comprised AHT, psychoactive medication, and pain and anti-inflammatory medication. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of the association of medication use with ED and to adjust for potential confounders including age, comorbid conditions and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: Multivariable analyses showed benzodiazepines (adjusted OR = 2.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03, 5.31) and tricyclic antidepressants (adjusted OR = 3.35, 95% CI: 1.09, 10.27) were associated with ED, while no association was observed for serotonin reuptake inhibitors/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and atypical antipsychotics. The use of AHT, whether in monotherapy or in conjunction with other AHTs, and pain or anti-inflammatory medications were not associated with ED after accounting for confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the BACH survey suggest adverse effects of some psychoactive medications (benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants). No evidence of an association of AHT or pain and anti-inflammatory medication with ED was observed.","Adult Aged Analgesics/adverse effects Anti-Inflammatory Agents/adverse effects Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects Benzodiazepines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Body Mass Index Boston/epidemiology Erectile Dysfunction/*chemically induced/epidemiology/prevention & control Health Surveys Humans Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Motor Activity Odds Ratio Prevalence Questionnaires Smoking/adverse effects/epidemiology"
23701754,The addition of a plain or herb-flavored reduced-fat dip is associated with improved preschoolers' intake of vegetables.,J Acad Nutr Diet,Savage JS and Peterson J and Marini M and Bordi PL Jr and Birch LL,psu,"This quasiexperimental study used a within-subjects experimental design to determine whether adding herbs and/or spices to a reduced-fat dip increased children's willingness to taste, liking of, and consumption of vegetables. Participants were preschool children aged 3 to 5 years who attended a child-care center in Central Pennsylvania in late 2008 and early 2009. First, children's familiarity with and liking of six raw vegetables and five dips (reduced-fat plain, herb, garlic, pizza, and ranch) were assessed. In Experiment 1 (n=34), children tasted a vegetable they liked, one they disliked, and one they refused, with a reduced-fat plain dip and their favorite reduced-fat herb-flavored dip. In Experiment 2 (n=26 or n=27), they rated their liking of celery and yellow squash, with and without their favorite reduced-fat herb dip (pizza or ranch), and their intake of those vegetable snacks was measured. In Experiment 1, the herb-flavored dip was preferred over the plain dip (P<0.01), and children were three times more likely to reject the vegetable alone, compared with eating the vegetable paired with an herb dip (P<0.001). In Experiment 2, children ate significantly more of a previously rejected or disliked vegetable (celery and squash) when offered with a preferred reduced-fat herb dip than when the vegetable was served alone (P<0.05). These findings suggest that offering vegetables with reduced-fat dips containing familiar herb and spice flavors can increase tasting and thereby promote liking, acceptance, and consumption of vegetables, including vegetables previously rejected or disliked.","Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena/physiology Child, Preschool Choice Behavior Condiments Cross-Over Studies Diet/*psychology/statistics & numerical data Diet, Fat-Restricted Eating/psychology Female Food Preferences/*psychology *Health Behavior Humans Male Pennsylvania Spices *Vegetables"
23728658,Probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in adults and children.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Goldenberg JZ and Ma SS and Saxton JD and Martzen MR and Vandvik PO and Thorlund K and Guyatt GH and Johnston BC,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are widely prescribed; however they can cause disturbances in gastrointestinal flora which may lead to reduced resistance to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). Probiotics are live organisms thought to balance the gastrointestinal flora. OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for preventing Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) or C. difficile infection in adults and children. SEARCH METHODS: On February 21, 2013 we searched PubMed (1966-2013), EMBASE (1966-2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), CINAHL (1982-2013), AMED (1985-2013), and ISI Web of Science. Additionally, we conducted an extensive grey literature search including contact with industry representatives. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled (placebo, alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment control) trials investigating probiotics (any strain, any dose) for prevention of CDAD, or C. difficile infection were considered for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently and in duplicate extracted data and assessed risk of bias using pre-constructed, and piloted, data extraction forms. Any disagreements were resolved by a third adjudicator. For articles published in abstract form only, further information was sought by contacting principal authors. The primary outcome was the incidence of CDAD. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of C. difficile infection, adverse events, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and length of hospital stay. Dichotomous outcomes (e.g. incidence of CDAD) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the relative risk and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Continuous outcomes (e.g. length of hospital) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of missing data on efficacy and safety outcomes. For the sensitivity analyses, we assumed that the event rate for those participants in the control group who had missing data was the same as the event rate for those participants in the control group who were successfully followed. For the probiotic group we calculated effects using the following assumed ratios of event rates in those with missing data in comparison to those successfully followed: 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 5:1. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic species, dose, adult versus pediatric population, and risk of bias.The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 1871 studies were identified with 31 (4492 participants) meeting eligibility requirements for our review. Overall 11 studies were rated as a high risk of bias due mostly to missing outcome data. A complete case analysis (i.e. participants who completed the study) of those trials investigating CDAD (23 trials, 4213 participants) suggests that probiotics significantly reduce this risk by 64%. The incidence of CDAD was 2.0% in the probiotic group compared to 5.5% in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.51). Sixteen of 23 trials had missing CDAD data ranging from 5% to 45%. These results proved robust to sensitivity analyses of plausible and worst-plausible assumptions regarding missing outcome data and were similar whether considering trials in adults versus children, lower versus higher doses, different probiotic species, or higher versus lower risk of bias. Our judgment is that the overall evidence warrants moderate confidence in this large relative risk reduction. We downgraded the overall quality of evidence for CDAD to 'moderate' due to imprecision. There were few events (154) and the calculated optimal information size (n = 8218) was more than the total sample size. With respect to the incidence of C. difficile infection, a secondary outcome, pooled complete case results from 13 trials (961 participants) did not show a statistically significant reduction. The incidence of C. difficile infection was 12.6% in the probiotics group compared to 12.7% in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.24). Adverse events were assessed in 26 studies (3964 participants) and our pooled complete case analysis indicates probiotics reduce the risk of adverse events by 20% (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95). In both treatment and control groups the most common adverse events included abdominal cramping, nausea, fever, soft stools, flatulence, and taste disturbance. For the short-term use of probiotics in patients that are not immunocompromised or severely debilitated, we consider the strength of this evidence to be moderate. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials including 4213 patients, moderate quality evidence suggests that probiotics are both safe and effective for preventing Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea.","Adult Anti-Bacterial Agents/*adverse effects Child *Clostridium difficile Diarrhea/microbiology/*prevention & control Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous/*complications Humans Probiotics/*therapeutic use Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of 1373 consecutive short stature referrals evaluated at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic between 2008 and 2011. We identified 235 patients with a height of <3rd percentile, negative history and review of systems, and normal physical examination. Outcome measures were incidence of pathology detection, diagnostic group characteristics, clinicians' adherence to testing guidelines, and screening costs. ANOVA and chi(2) were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Nearly 99% of patients were diagnosed as possible variants of normal growth: 23% with familial short stature, 41% with constitutional delay of growth and maturation, and 36% with idiopathic short stature. The incidence of newly diagnosed pathology was 1.3%: 1 patient with biopsy-proved celiac disease, 1 with unconfirmed celiac disease, and 1 with potential insulin-like growth factor I receptor defect. On average, each patient had 64.3% of the recommended tests for age and sex; 2.1% of patients had all of the recommended testing. The total screening tests costs were $315321, yielding $105107 per new diagnosis entertained. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy short children do not warrant nondirected, comprehensive screening. Future guidelines for evaluating short stature should include patient-specific testing.","Adolescent Algorithms Biopsy *Body Height Child Child, Preschool Evidence-Based Medicine Female Growth Disorders/*diagnosis/*economics Health Care Costs Humans Infant Male Pediatrics/*economics/methods Retrospective Studies"
23679066,Psychological Characteristics of BDSM Practitioners.,J Sex Med,Wismeijer AA and van Assen MA,Missing,"INTRODUCTION: It has been generally thought that the practice of bondage-discipline, dominance-submission, sadism-masochism (BDSM) is in some form associated with psychopathology. However, several more recent studies suggest a relative good psychological health of BDSM practitioners. AIM: The aim of this study was to compare scores of BDSM practitioners and a control group on various fundamental psychological characteristics. METHODS: For this aim, 902 BDSM and 434 control participants completely filled out online questionnaires. Associations were examined using chi(2) tests of independence with phi and Cramer's V as effect size measures and eta or Pearson's correlation. Group differences were tested using analysis of covariance, with partial eta(2) as effect size measure. A priori contrasts were tested using alpha = 0.01 to correct for multiple testing; for all other tests we used alpha = 0.05, two tailed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study used Big Five personality dimensions (NEO Five-Factor Inventory), attachment styles (Attachment Styles Questionnaire), rejection sensitivity (Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire), and subjective well-being (World Health Organization-Five Well-being Index). RESULTS: The results mostly suggest favorable psychological characteristics of BDSM practitioners compared with the control group; BDSM practitioners were less neurotic, more extraverted, more open to new experiences, more conscientious, less rejection sensitive, had higher subjective well-being, yet were less agreeable. Comparing the four groups, if differences were observed, BDSM scores were generally more favorably for those with a dominant than a submissive role, with least favorable scores for controls. CONCLUSION: We conclude that BDSM may be thought of as a recreational leisure, rather than the expression of psychopathological processes.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether statin use is associated with musculoskeletal conditions, including arthropathy and injury, in a military health care system. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study with propensity score matching. SETTING: San Antonio Military Multi-Market. PARTICIPANTS: Tricare Prime/Plus beneficiaries evaluated from October 1, 2003, to March 1, 2010. INTERVENTIONS: Statin use during fiscal year 2005. On the basis of medication fills, patients were divided into 2 groups: statin users (received a statin for at least 90 days) and nonusers (never received a statin throughout the study period). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Using patients' baseline characteristics, we generated a propensity score that was used to match statin users and nonusers; odds ratios (ORs) were determined for each outcome measure. Secondary analyses determined adjusted ORs for all patients who met study criteria and a subgroup of patients with no comorbidities identified using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Sensitivity analysis further determined adjusted ORs for a subgroup of patients with no musculoskeletal diseases at baseline and a subgroup of patients who continued statin therapy for 2 years or more. The occurrence of musculoskeletal conditions was determined using prespecified groups of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, ClinicalModification codes: Msk1, all musculoskeletal diseases; Msk1a, arthropathies and related diseases; Msk1b, injury-related diseases (dislocation, sprain, strain); and Msk2, drug-associated musculoskeletal pain. RESULTS: A total of 46 249 individuals met study criteria (13 626 statin users and 32 623 nonusers). Of these, we propensity score-matched 6967 statin users with 6967 nonusers. Among matched pairs, statin users had a higher OR for Msk1 (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08-1.30), Msk1b (1.13; 1.05-1.21), and Msk2 (1.09; 1.02-1.18); the OR for Msk1a was 1.07 (0.99-1.16; P = .07). Secondary and sensitivity analyses revealed higher adjusted ORs for statin users in all outcome groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Musculoskeletal conditions, arthropathies, injuries, and pain are more common among statin users than among similar nonusers. The full spectrum of statins' musculoskeletal adverse events may not be fully explored, and further studies are warranted, especially in physically active individuals.","Cohort Studies Dislocations/epidemiology Female Humans Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*adverse effects Joint Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology Logistic Models Male Matched-Pair Analysis Middle Aged Muscle, Skeletal/*injuries Musculoskeletal Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology Pain/chemically induced/epidemiology Propensity Score Retrospective Studies Sprains and Strains/epidemiology"
23732712,Meeting meaningful use criteria and managing patient populations: a national survey of practicing physicians.,Ann Intern Med,DesRoches CM and Audet AM and Painter M and Donelan K,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Meaningful use, as defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, will require the aggregation of patient data to enable population assessment. Little is known about the proportion of physicians who are able to meet meaningful use criteria or their use of electronic health records (EHRs) to manage patient populations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate physicians' reports of EHR adoption and ease of use and their ability to use EHRs for patient panel management. DESIGN: National mailed survey of practicing physicians (response rate of 60%). SETTING: Late 2011 and early 2012. PARTICIPANTS: 1820 primary care physicians and specialists in office-based practices. MEASUREMENTS: Proportion of physicians who have a basic EHR and meet meaningful use criteria and ease of use of computerized systems designed for patient population management tasks. RESULTS: A total of 43.5% of physicians reported having a basic EHR, and 9.8% met meaningful use criteria. Computerized systems for managing patient populations were not widespread; fewer than one half of respondents reported the presence of computerized systems for any of the patient population management tasks included in the survey. Physicians with such functionalities reported that these systems varied in ease of use. Physicians with an EHR that met meaningful use criteria were significantly more likely than those not meeting the standard to rate panel management tasks as easy. LIMITATION: Ease-of-use measures are subjective. CONCLUSION: Few physicians could meet meaningful use criteria in early 2012 and using computerized systems for the panel management tasks was difficult. Results support the growing evidence that using the basic data input capabilities of an EHR does not translate into the greater opportunity that these technologies promise.

23733803,Sick-visit immunizations and delayed well-baby visits.,Pediatrics,Robison SG,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: Giving recommended immunizations during sick visits for minor and acute illness such as acute otitis media has long been an American Academy of Pediatrics/Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice recommendation. An addition to the American Academy of Pediatrics policy in 2010 advised considering whether giving immunizations at the sick visit would discourage making up missed well-baby visits. This study quantifies the potential tradeoff between sick-visit immunizations and well-baby visits. METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis with a case-control component of sick visits for acute otitis media that supplanted normal well-baby visits at age 2, 4, or 6 months. Infants were stratified for sick-visit immunization, no sick-visit immunization but quick makeup well-baby visits, or no sick-visit immunizations or quick makeup visits. Immunization rates and well-baby visit rates were assessed through 24 months of age. RESULTS: For 1060 study cases, no significant difference was detected in immunization rates or well-baby visits through 24 months of age between those with or without sick-visit immunizations. Thirty-nine percent of infants without a sick-visit shot failed to return for a quick makeup well-baby visit; this delayed group was significantly less likely to be up-to-date for immunizations (relative risk: 0.66) and had fewer well-baby visits (mean: 3.8) from 2 through 24 months of age compared with those with sick-visit shots (mean: 4.7). CONCLUSIONS: The substantial risk that infants will not return for a timely makeup well-baby visit after a sick visit should be included in any consideration of whether to delay immunizations.",Child Health Services/*utilization Cohort Studies Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis Vaccines/*administration & dosage Female Humans *Immunization Schedule Infant Male Oregon Otitis Media/*epidemiology/*therapy Patient Compliance/*statistics & numerical data Physician's Role Referral and Consultation/*utilization Retrospective Studies Utilization Review/statistics & numerical data

The primary endpoint was target waiting time exceeded, defined as a waiting time for medical assessment longer than the maximal recommended waiting time according to triage level. To assess our primary objective, we performed logistic regression using patient- and ED-related variables to determine whether age greater than 75 years was independently associated with higher rate of target waiting time exceeded. RESULTS: A total of 317,793 patients were included, of whom 173,629 (55%) had an exceeded target waiting time. Mean age was 45.8 years and 12.7% were older than 75 years. Target waiting time was exceeded for 55% of patients: 53% for patients younger than 75 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 53% to 54%) versus 64% for older patients (95% CI 63% to 65%), relative risk 1.20. In the multivariate analysis, age greater than 75 years was independently associated with an exceeded target waiting time (odds ratio [OR] 1.30; 95% CI 1.27 to 1.33). Other variables associated with exceeded target waiting time were triage level (OR 5.45 [95% CI 5.32 to 5.60] for triage level 2 versus triage level 4), high daily occupancy (OR 3.78 [95% CI 3.53 to 4.03]), day of the week (OR 1.12 [95% CI 1.09 to 1.14] for Monday), and time of the visit (OR 1.79 [95% CI 1.76 to 1.82] from 6 pm to 8 am). CONCLUSION: Patients older than 75 years are less likely to be seen within the target waiting time.","Adult Age Factors Aged Bed Occupancy Cross-Sectional Studies Emergency Service, Hospital/*organization & administration Female Humans Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Paris Retrospective Studies Time Factors *Triage Waiting Lists"

23715824,Isokinetic concentric quadriceps and hamstring strength variables from the NFL Scouting Combine are not predictive of hamstring injury in first-year professional football players.,Am J Sports Med,Zvijac JE and Toriscelli TA and Merrick S and Kiebzak GM,Missing,"BACKGROUND: There are conflicting reports regarding the association between isokinetic concentric quadriceps and hamstring strength deficits and ratios and risk for hamstring injuries in athletes. PURPOSE: To determine if isokinetic concentric Cybex data collected during the annual National Football League (NFL) Scouting Combine are predictive of hamstring injury in professional American football players during their first season. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: All 32 NFL teams identified players selected during the first 5 rounds of the NFL annual draft who had hamstring injuries during their first professional season. Of these, 164 players with 172 injuries also had Cybex data from the previous year's Combine. Analyses compared injured legs with contralateral uninjured legs and also injured players with uninjured controls using a database of Cybex data from all players who participated in the NFL Scouting Combine from 2006 to 2011. RESULTS: No Cybex strength variable differentiated the injured legs from the contralateral uninjured legs or injured players from uninjured controls, even after taking into account days lost from activity. Mean +/- SD peak torque for the injured and contralateral uninjured sides was as follows: 315.7 +/- 70.0 and 313.5 +/- 68.3 N . m, respectively (P = .773, paired t test), for quadriceps and 203.0 +/- 42.4 and 205.3 +/- 42.5 N . m, respectively (P = .608, paired t test), for hamstrings. The sensitivity and specificity for the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio predicting hamstring injury were 0.513 (95% confidence interval, 0.419-0.607) and 0.524 (0.495-0.554), indicating that the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio was not a useful predictor of injury (calculation used the mean +/- SD ratio for injured legs, 0.656 +/- 0.133). Side-to-side peak torque differences were also not predictive of injury, with more than a 10% difference (plus or minus) occurring commonly in both injured and uninjured players for quadriceps (53% prevalence for both injured and uninjured) and hamstrings (injured, 41% prevalence; uninjured, 43% prevalence). CONCLUSION: Isokinetic strength data collected from collegiate players at the NFL Scouting Combine were not useful for predicting risk of hamstring injury in subsequent professional NFL competition. These data call into question commonly accepted assumptions about risk factors for hamstring injury, at least for elite collegiate American football players, when the temporal relationship between Cybex testing and actual injury is several months.",Athletic Injuries/epidemiology Football/*injuries Humans Male *Muscle Strength Predictive Value of Tests Quadriceps Muscle/*physiology Thigh/injuries United States/epidemiology Young Adult
23679151,Pelvic floor muscle problems mediate sexual problems in young adult rape victims.,J Sex Med,Postma R and Bicanic I and van der Vaart H and Laan E,Missing,"INTRODUCTION: Prior studies have addressed sexual abuse and sexual function in adult women. No studies have focused on the effect of adolescence rape on sexual functioning. AIM: To investigate the effect of rape on sexual problems and on pelvic floor problems, as well as the mediating role of pelvic floor problems on sexual problems, in a homogenous group of victims of adolescence rape without a history of childhood sexual, physical, and/or emotional abuse. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sexual functioning and pelvic floor functioning were assessed using self-report questionnaires. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a group of 89 young women aged 18-25 years who were victimized by rape in adolescence was compared with a group of 114 nonvictimized controls. The rape victims were treated for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 3 years prior to participation in the study. RESULTS: Three years posttreatment, rape victims were 2.4 times more likely to have a sexual dysfunction (lubrication problems and pain) and 2.7 times more likely to have pelvic floor dysfunction (symptoms of provoked vulvodynia, general stress, lower urinary tract, and irritable bowel syndrome) than nonvictimized controls. The relationship between rape and sexual problems was partially mediated by the presence of pelvic floor problems. Rape victims and controls did not differ with regard to sexual activities. CONCLUSIONS: Rape victims suffer significantly more from sexual dysfunction and pelvic floor dysfunction when compared with nontraumatized controls, despite the provision of treatment for PTSD. Possibly, physical manifestations of PTSD have been left unaddressed in treatment. Future treatment protocols should consider incorporating (physical or psychological) treatment strategies for sexual dysfunction and/or pelvic floor dysfunction into trauma exposure treatments.",Missing

METHODS: Adrenaline hydrochloride, cisatracurium besylate, lorazepam, methylergonovine maleate, and succinylcholine chloride were stored for 1 year under the 3 conditions. For each storage condition, samples of the drugs were taken after 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks and after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months. For adrenaline hydrochloride, however, the samples were taken after 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months. The samples were analyzed with a validated high-performance liquid chromatography assay. A drug was considered stable if its content was above 90%. RESULTS: Adrenaline hydrochloride and methylergonovine maleate remained stable for 1 year at room temperature and in the emergency physician transport vehicle. At room temperature and in the emergency physician transport vehicle, lorazepam became unstable within 4 weeks. Succinylcholine chloride was stable for 2 months at room temperature and for 1 month in the emergency physician transport vehicle. Cisatracurium besylate became unstable within 4 months at room temperature. However, it remained stable for 4 months in the emergency physician transport vehicle. CONCLUSION: When stored at room temperature or in the emergency physician transport vehicle, lorazepam became unstable within weeks, whereas succinylcholine chloride and cisatracurium besylate became unstable within months. Adrenaline hydrochloride and methylergonovine maleate remained stable for several months, even under room temperature and emergency physician transport vehicle conditions. Thus, real-world EMS working conditions pose challenges for maintaining optimal efficacy of these important EMS drugs.","Ambulances Atracurium/analogs & derivatives/analysis/standards Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid *Drug Stability Drug Storage/methods/standards Emergency Medical Services Epinephrine/analysis/standards Methylergonovine/analysis/standards Succinylcholine/analysis/standards *Temperature Time Factors"

OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of symptomatic gallstones requiring hospital care and/or cholecystectomy in a commercial weight loss program using VLCD or low-calorie diet (LCD). DESIGN: A 1-year matched cohort study of consecutively enrolled adults in a commercial weight loss program conducted at 28 Swedish centers between 2006 and 2009. A 3-month weight loss phase of VLCD (500 kcal per day) or LCD (1200-1500 kcal per day) was followed by a 9-month weight maintenance phase. Matching (1:1) was performed by age, sex, body mass index, waist circumference and gallstone history (n=3320:3320). Gallstone and cholecystectomy data were retrieved from the Swedish National Patient Register. RESULTS: One-year weight loss was greater in the VLCD than in the LCD group (-11.1 versus -8.1 kg; adjusted difference, -2.8 kg, 95% CI -3.1 to -2.4; P<0.001). During 6361 person-years, 48 and 14 gallstones requiring hospital care occurred in the VLCD and LCD groups, respectively, (152 versus 44/10 000 person-years; hazard ratio, 3.4, 95% CI 1.8-6.3; P<0.001; number-needed-to-harm, 92, 95% CI 63-168; P<0.001). Of the 62 gallstone events, 38 (61%) resulted in cholecystectomy (29 versus 9; hazard ratio, 3.2, 95% CI 1.5-6.8; P=0.003; number-needed-to-harm, 151, 95% CI 94-377; P<0.001). Adjusting for 3-month weight loss attenuated the hazard ratios, but the risk remained higher with VLCD than LCD for gallstones (2.5, 95% CI 1.3-5.1; P=0.009) and became borderline for cholecystectomy (2.2, 95% CI 0.9-5.2; P=0.08). CONCLUSION: The risk of symptomatic gallstones requiring hospitalization or cholecystectomy, albeit low, was 3-fold greater with VLCD than LCD during the 1-year commercial weight loss program.",Missing

OBJECTIVES: To quantify trends in the use of CT in pediatrics and the associated radiation exposure and cancer risk. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Seven US health care systems. PARTICIPANTS: The use of CT was evaluated for children younger than 15 years of age from 1996 to 2010, including 4 857 736 child-years of observation. Radiation doses were calculated for 744 CT scans performed between 2001 and 2011. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of CT use, organ and effective doses, and projected lifetime attributable risks of cancer. RESULTS The use of CT doubled for children younger than 5 years of age and tripled for children 5 to 14 years of age between 1996 and 2005, remained stable between 2006 and 2007, and then began to decline. Effective doses varied from 0.03 to 69.2 mSv per scan. An effective dose of 20 mSv or higher was delivered by 14% to 25% of abdomen/pelvis scans, 6% to 14% of spine scans, and 3% to 8% of chest scans. Projected lifetime attributable risks of solid cancer were higher for younger patients and girls than for older patients and boys, and they were also higher for patients who underwent CT scans of the abdomen/pelvis or spine than for patients who underwent other types of CT scans. For girls, a radiation-induced solid cancer is projected to result from every 300 to 390 abdomen/pelvis scans, 330 to 480 chest scans, and 270 to 800 spine scans, depending on age. The risk of leukemia was highest from head scans for children younger than 5 years of age at a rate of 1.9 cases per 10 000 CT scans. Nationally, 4 million pediatric CT scans of the head, abdomen/pelvis, chest, or spine performed each year are projected to cause 4870 future cancers. Reducing the highest 25% of doses to the median might prevent 43% of these cancers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The increased use of CT in pediatrics, combined with the wide variability in radiation doses, has resulted in many children receiving a high-dose examination. Dose-reduction strategies targeted to the highest quartile of doses could dramatically reduce the number of radiation-induced cancers.","Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Female Humans Male Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/*etiology *Radiation Dosage Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*adverse effects"
23761485,Caloric effect of a 16-ounce (473-mL) portion-size cap on sugar-sweetened beverages served in restaurants.,Am J Clin Nutr,Wang YC and Vine SM,columbia,"BACKGROUND: New York City recently proposed a restriction to cap the portion size of all sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) sold in food-service establishments at 16 oz (473 mL). One critical question is whether such a policy may disproportionally affect low-income or overweight individuals. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the demographic characteristics of US individuals potentially affected by a 16-oz portion-size cap on SSBs and the potential effect on caloric intake. DESIGN: We analyzed dietary records from the NHANES 2007-2010. We estimated the proportion of individuals who consumed at least one SSB >16 fluid oz (473 mL) in restaurants by age, household income, and weight status. RESULTS: Of all SSBs >16 oz (473 mL) purchased from food-service establishments, 64.7% were purchased from fast food restaurants, 28.2% from other restaurants, and 4.6% from sports, recreation, and entertainment facilities. On a given day, the policy would affect 7.2% of children and 7.6% of adults. Overweight individuals are more likely to consume these beverages, whereas there was no significant difference between income groups. If 80% of affected consumers choose a 16-oz (473-mL) beverage, the policy would result in a change of -57.6 kcal in each affected consumer aged 2-19 y (95% CI: -65.0, -50.1) and -62.6 kcal in those aged >/=20 y (95% CI: -67.9, -57.4). CONCLUSION: A policy to cap portion size is likely to result in a modest reduction in excess calories from SSBs, especially among young adults and children who are overweight.","Adolescent Adult Aged Beverages/*analysis Body Mass Index Body Weight Child Child, Preschool Dietary Sucrose/*administration & dosage Energy Intake Humans Income Middle Aged New York City *Nutrition Policy Nutrition Surveys Overweight/prevention & control *Restaurants Socioeconomic Factors Sweetening Agents/*administration & dosage Young Adult"

Evidence from trials with high methodologic quality is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of device-guided lowering of breathing frequency on blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. DESIGN: Single-center, double-blind, sham-controlled trial. SETTING: A large nonacademic teaching hospital in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. INTERVENTION: Fifteen-minute sessions with either the device that guides breathing through musical tones to a lower breathing frequency (aiming at <10 breaths/min) or a sham device (music without aiming at lowering of breathing frequency) for an 8-week study period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured in the physician's office. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were randomized; 21 patients (88%) in the intervention group and 24 patients (100%) in the control group completed the study. There were no significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, with a difference in systolic blood pressure of 2.35 mm Hg (95% CI, -6.50 to 11.20) in favor of the control group and a difference in diastolic blood pressure of 2.25 mm Hg (95% CI, -2.16 to 6.67) in favor of the intervention group. Three patients in the intervention group experienced adverse events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This high methodologic quality study shows no significant effect of device-guided lowering of breathing frequency on office-measured blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes. On the basis of this study, together with results from all but one previous trial, device-guided lowering of breathing frequency does not appear to be a viable nonpharmacologic option for hypertension treatment.","Aged Biofeedback, Psychology *Breathing Exercises Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications Double-Blind Method Female Humans Hypertension/complications/*therapy Male Middle Aged Music Therapy/*instrumentation *Respiratory Rate"
23753095,A systematic review of home-based childhood obesity prevention studies.,Pediatrics,Showell NN and Fawole O and Segal J and Wilson RF and Cheskin LJ and Bleich SN and Wu Y and Lau B and Wang Y,jhmi,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Childhood obesity is a global epidemic. Despite emerging research about the role of the family and home on obesity risk behaviors, the evidence base for the effectiveness of home-based interventions on obesity prevention remains uncertain. The objective was to systematically review the effectiveness of home-based interventions on weight, intermediate (eg, diet and physical activity [PA]), and clinical outcomes. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, PsychInfo, CINAHL, clinicaltrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library from inception through August 11, 2012. We included experimental and natural experimental studies with >/=1-year follow-up reporting weight-related outcomes and targeting children at home. Two independent reviewers screened studies and extracted data. We graded the strength of the evidence supporting interventions targeting diet, PA, or both for obesity prevention. RESULTS: We identified 6 studies; 3 tested combined interventions (diet and PA), 1 used diet intervention, 1 combined intervention with primary care and consumer health informatics components, and 1 combined intervention with school and community components. Select combined interventions had beneficial effects on fruit/vegetable intake and sedentary behaviors. However, none of the 6 studies reported a significant effect on weight outcomes. Overall, the strength of evidence is low that combined home-based interventions effectively prevent obesity. The evidence is insufficient for conclusions about home-based diet interventions or interventions implemented at home in association with other settings. CONCLUSIONS: The strength of evidence is low to support the effectiveness of home-based child obesity prevention programs. Additional research is needed to test interventions in the home setting, particularly those incorporating parenting strategies and addressing environmental influences.","Adolescent Body Weight Child Child, Preschool Combined Modality Therapy Cross-Sectional Studies Developed Countries Diet, Reducing Female Food Habits *Home Care Services Humans Life Style Male Motor Activity Obesity/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control Overweight/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Risk Factors Treatment Outcome United States"
23770178,Acute exposure to air pollution triggers atrial fibrillation.,J Am Coll Cardiol,Link MS and Luttmann-Gibson H and Schwartz J and Mittleman MA and Wessler B and Gold DR and Dockery DW and Laden F,tuftsmedicalcenter,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the association of air pollution with the onset of atrial fibrillation (AF). BACKGROUND: Air pollution in general and more specifically particulate matter has been associated with cardiovascular events. Although ventricular arrhythmias are traditionally thought to convey the increased cardiovascular risk, AF may also contribute. METHODS: Patients with dual chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) were enrolled and followed prospectively. The association of AF onset with air quality including ambient particulate matter <2.5 mum aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), black carbon, sulfate, particle number, NO2, SO2, and O3 in the 24 h prior to the arrhythmia was examined utilizing a case-crossover analysis. In sensitivity analyses, associations with air pollution between 2 and 48 h prior to the AF were examined. RESULTS: Of 176 patients followed for an average of 1.9 years, 49 patients had 328 episodes of AF lasting >/= 30 s. Positive but nonsignificant associations were found for PM2.5 in the prior 24 h, but stronger associations were found with shorter exposure windows. The odds of AF increased by 26% (95% confidence interval: 8% to 47%) for each 6.0 mug/m(3) increase in PM2.5 in the 2 h prior to the event (p = 0.004). The odds of AF were highest at the upper quartile of mean PM2.5. CONCLUSIONS: PM was associated with increased odds of AF onset within hours following exposure in patients with known cardiac disease. Air pollution is an acute trigger of AF, likely contributing to the pollution-associated adverse cardiac outcomes observed in epidemiological studies.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Atrial Fibrillation/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy Cross-Over Studies Defibrillators, Implantable Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects/analysis Female Humans Incidence Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Odds Ratio Particulate Matter/*adverse effects/analysis Prospective Studies Risk Factors Time Factors"

23756332,Risk of arrhythmias in 52 755 long-distance cross-country skiers: a cohort study.,Eur Heart J,Andersen K and Farahmand B and Ahlbom A and Held C and Ljunghall S and Michaelsson K and Sundstrom J,Missing,"AIMS: We aimed to investigate the association of number of completed races and finishing time with risk of arrhythmias among participants of Vasaloppet, a 90 km cross-country skiing event. METHODS AND RESULTS: All the participants without cardiovascular disease who completed Vasaloppet during 1989-98 were followed through national registries until December 2005. Primary outcome was hospitalization for any arrhythmia and secondary outcomes were atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF), bradyarrhythmias, other supraventricular tachycardias (SVT), and ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation/cardiac arrest (VT/VF/CA). Among 52 755 participants, 919 experienced arrhythmia during follow-up. Adjusting for age, education, and occupational status, those who completed the highest number of races during the period had higher risk of any arrhythmias [hazard ratio (HR)1.30; 95% CI 1.08-1.58; for >/=5 vs. 1 completed race], AF (HR 1.29; 95% CI 1.04-1.61), and bradyarrhythmias (HR 2.10; 95% CI 1.28-3.47). Those who had the fastest relative finishing time also had higher risk of any arrhythmias (HR 1.30; 95% CI 1.04-1.62; for 100-160% vs. >240% of winning time), AF (1.20; 95% CI 0.93-1.55), and bradyarrhythmias (HR 1.85; 95% CI 0.97-3.54). SVT or VT/VF/CA was not associated with finishing time or number of completed races. CONCLUSIONS: Among male participants of a 90 km cross-country skiing event, a faster finishing time and a high number of completed races were associated with higher risk of arrhythmias. This was mainly driven by a higher incidence of AF and bradyarrhythmias. No association with SVT or VT/VF/CA was found.","Adolescent Adult Aged Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*epidemiology Cohort Studies Female Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/epidemiology Risk Factors Skiing/*physiology/statistics & numerical data Sweden/epidemiology Young Adult"

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Urban maternity hospital in Ireland. POPULATION: A total of 36 916 nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies who delivered between 2000 and 2011. METHODS: The study population was subdivided into five maternal age groups based on age at first booking visit: </=17 years, 18-19 years, 20-34 years, 35-39 years and women aged >/=40 years. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between extremes of maternal age and delivery outcomes, adjusting for potential confounding factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preterm birth, admission to the neonatal unit, congenital anomaly, caesarean section. RESULTS: Compared with maternal age 20-34 years, age </=17 years was a risk factor for preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] 1.83, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.33-2.52). Babies born to mothers >/=40 years were more likely to require admission to the neonatal unit (adjOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06-1.72) and to have a congenital anomaly (adjOR 1.71, 95% CI 1.07-2.76). The overall caesarean section rate in nulliparous women was 23.9% with marked differences at the extremes of maternal age; 10.7% at age </=17 years (adjOR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34-0.62) and 54.4% at age >/=40 years (adjOR 3.24, 95% CI 2.67-3.94). CONCLUSIONS: Extremes of maternal age need to be recognised as risk factors for adverse delivery outcomes. Low caesarean section rates in younger women suggest that a reduction in overall caesarean section rates may be possible.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors Cesarean Section/*statistics & numerical data Congenital Abnormalities/*epidemiology Female Humans Infant, Newborn Infant, Newborn, Diseases/*epidemiology Ireland/epidemiology *Maternal Age Premature Birth/*epidemiology Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Young Adult"
23776117,Osteopathic manipulative treatment for pediatric conditions: a systematic review.,Pediatrics,Posadzki P and Lee MS and Ernst E,Missing,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Most osteopaths are trained in pediatric care, and osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is available for many pediatric conditions. The objective of this systematic review was to critically evaluate the effectiveness of OMT as a treatment of pediatric conditions. METHODS: Eleven databases were searched from their respective inceptions to November 2012. Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included, if they tested OMT against any type of control in pediatric patients. Study quality was critically appraised by using the Cochrane criteria. RESULTS: Seventeen trials met the inclusion criteria. Five RCTs were of high methodological quality. Of those, 1 favored OMT, whereas 4 revealed no effect compared with various control interventions. Replications by independent researchers were available for 2 conditions only, and both failed to confirm the findings of the previous studies. Seven RCTs suggested that OMT leads to a significantly greater reduction in the symptoms of asthma, congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (posttreatment), daily weight gain and length of hospital stay, dysfunctional voiding, infantile colic, otitis media, or postural asymmetry compared with various control interventions. Seven RCTs indicated that OMT had no effect on the symptoms of asthma, cerebral palsy, idiopathic scoliosis, obstructive apnea, otitis media, or temporomandibular disorders compared with various control interventions. Three RCTs did not perform between-group comparisons. The majority of the included RCTs did not report the incidence rates of adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence of the effectiveness of OMT for pediatric conditions remains unproven due to the paucity and low methodological quality of the primary studies.","Adolescent Asthma/therapy Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/therapy Bronchiolitis/therapy Cerebral Palsy/therapy Child Child, Preschool Chronic Disease/therapy Humans Infant *Manipulation, Osteopathic Musculoskeletal Diseases/therapy Otitis Media/therapy Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/therapy Treatment Outcome"
23779232,Changes in red meat consumption and subsequent risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus: three cohorts of US men and women.,JAMA Intern Med,Pan A and Sun Q and Bernstein AM and Manson JE and Willett WC and Hu FB,nus,"IMPORTANCE: Red meat consumption has been consistently associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, whether changes in red meat intake are related to subsequent T2DM risk remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between changes in red meat consumption during a 4-year period and subsequent 4-year risk of T2DM in US adults. DESIGN AND SETTING: Three prospective cohort studies in US men and women. PARTICIPANTS: We followed up 26,357 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2006), 48,709 women in the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2006), and 74,077 women in the Nurses' Health Study II (1991-2007). Diet was assessed by validated food frequency questionnaires and updated every 4 years. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios with adjustment for age, family history, race, marital status, initial red meat consumption, smoking status, and initial and changes in other lifestyle factors (physical activity, alcohol intake, total energy intake, and diet quality). Results across cohorts were pooled by an inverse variance-weighted, fixed-effect meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident T2DM cases validated by supplementary questionnaires. RESULTS: During 1,965,824 person-years of follow-up, we documented 7540 incident T2DM cases. In the multivariate-adjusted models, increasing red meat intake during a 4-year interval was associated with an elevated risk of T2DM during the subsequent 4 years in each cohort (all P < .001 for trend). Compared with the reference group of no change in red meat intake, increasing red meat intake of more than 0.50 servings per day was associated with a 48% (pooled hazard ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.37-1.59) elevated risk in the subsequent 4-year period, and the association was modestly attenuated after further adjustment for initial body mass index and concurrent weight gain (1.30; 95% CI, 1.21-1.41). Reducing red meat consumption by more than 0.50 servings per day from baseline to the first 4 years of follow-up was associated with a 14% (pooled hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.93) lower risk during the subsequent entire follow-up through 2006 or 2007. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Increasing red meat consumption over time is associated with an elevated subsequent risk of T2DM, and the association is partly mediated by body weight. Our results add further evidence that limiting red meat consumption over time confers benefits for T2DM prevention.","Body Mass Index Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*epidemiology/*etiology Diet/adverse effects Energy Intake Female Follow-Up Studies Health Surveys Humans Male Meat/*adverse effects Middle Aged Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Questionnaires United States/epidemiology Weight Gain"
23773285,No small slam: increasing incidents of genitourinary injury from toilets and toilet seats.,BJU Int,Glass AS and Bagga HS and Tasian GE and McGeady JB and McCulloch CE and Blaschko SD and McAninch JW and Breyer BN,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of genitourinary (GU) injury from toilets that present to USA Emergency rooms (ERs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) is a stratified probability sample of hospital ER visits for USA consumer product-related injuries. NEISS was used to estimate total toilet- and toilet seat-related GU injury for the years 2002-2010, as well as to describe demographics and injury characteristics. Analyses were performed using strata, primary sampling units and sample weights to accommodate the complex sample survey design. Data are reported as national estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) provided. RESULTS: In all, 13 175 (95% CI 10 185-16 165) GU injuries related to toilets presented to ERs during 2002-2010. The most common mechanism involved crush from accidental fall of toilet seat, described in 9011 (68.4%, 95% CI 6907-11 115) cases. Most crush injuries were isolated to the penis (98.1%). Of crush injuries, 81.7% occurred in children aged 2-3 years and 99.3% occurred in the home. Crush injuries increased over the period 2002-2010 (P = 0.017) by approximately 100 per year, ending with an estimated 1707 (95% CI 1011-2402) by 2010. Most patients who sustained toilet- and toilet seat-related GU injuries were treated in the ER and then discharged. CONCLUSION: While penile crush injury related to a toilet seat is an uncommon mechanism of urological injury in children, the number of incidents appears to be rising. These findings support educational efforts and interventions, such as exchange of heavy toilet seats with slow-close toilet seat technology.","Adolescent Adult Aged Child Child, Preschool Genitalia/*injuries Humans Male Middle Aged Penis/injuries *Toilet Facilities United States/epidemiology Wounds and Injuries/epidemiology"

The aim of our study was to investigate whether HPV antibodies are associated with head and neck cancer risk when measured in prediagnostic sera. METHODS: We identified 638 participants with incident head and neck cancers (patients; 180 oral cancers, 135 oropharynx cancers, and 247 hypopharynx/larynx cancers) and 300 patients with esophageal cancers as well as 1,599 comparable controls from within the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. Prediagnostic plasma samples from patients (collected, on average, 6 years before diagnosis) and control participants were analyzed for antibodies against multiple proteins of HPV16 as well as HPV6, HPV11, HPV18, HPV31, HPV33, HPV45, and HPV52. Odds ratios (ORs) of cancer and 95% CIs were calculated, adjusting for potential confounders. All-cause mortality was evaluated among patients using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: HPV16 E6 seropositivity was present in prediagnostic samples for 34.8% of patients with oropharyngeal cancer and 0.6% of controls (OR, 274; 95% CI, 110 to 681) but was not associated with other cancer sites. The increased risk of oropharyngeal cancer among HPV16 E6 seropositive participants was independent of time between blood collection and diagnosis and was observed more than 10 years before diagnosis. The all-cause mortality ratio among patients with oropharyngeal cancer was 0.30 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.67), for patients who were HPV16 E6 seropositive compared with seronegative. CONCLUSION: HPV16 E6 seropositivity was present more than 10 years before diagnosis of oropharyngeal cancers.","Adult Aged Antibodies, Viral/*analysis/blood Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies Europe/epidemiology Female Follow-Up Studies Head and Neck Neoplasms/*epidemiology/immunology/*virology Human papillomavirus 16/immunology/*isolation & purification Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Oncogene Proteins, Viral/immunology Papillomavirus Infections/*epidemiology/immunology/virology Repressor Proteins/immunology United States/epidemiology"
23775973,Correlation between financial relationships with commercial interests and research prominence at an oncology meeting.,J Clin Oncol,Moy B and Bradbury AR and Helft PR and Egleston BL and Sheikh-Salah M and Peppercorn J,partners,"PURPOSE: Little is known about the effects of financial relationships between biomedical researchers and industry (financial conflicts of interest [FCOIs]) on research prominence. We examined the prevalence of FCOIs in oncology and associations between FCOIs and research prominence among abstracts presented at American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meetings. METHODS: We analyzed 20,718 abstracts presented at ASCO meetings in 2006 and 2008 to 2011. Measures included the following: financial relationships, peer review score (PRS), and meeting placement prominence (descending order of prominence: plenary session, clinical science symposium, oral presentation, poster discussion, general posters, and publish only). RESULTS: Of 20,718 abstracts, 36% reported at least one author with an FCOI. The proportion of abstracts with any FCOI increased from 33% in 2006 to 38% in 2011 (P < .001). Abstracts with FCOIs had significantly higher meeting prominence compared with publish only and general poster abstracts. The odds ratios compared with general posters were 7.3 for plenary session, 2.2 for clinical science symposium, 1.9 for oral presentation, and 1.7 for poster discussion (P < .001). Abstracts with FCOIs had significantly better PRSs compared with those without FCOIs. For all abstracts, PRS was 2.76 (95% CI, 2.75 to 2.77) with FCOIs compared with 3.01 (95% CI, 3.001 to 3.02) without FCOIs (P < .001). Omitting publish-only abstracts, PRS was 2.62 (95% CI, 2.61 to 2.63) with FCOIs compared with 2.73 without FCOIs (95% CI, 2.71 to 2.73). CONCLUSION: Abstracts with FCOIs had more prominent meeting placement and better PRSs. FCOIs were reported more frequently by year, suggesting an increasing influence of industry on cancer research, greater disclosure, or both.",Biomedical Research/economics Financial Support Humans Medical Oncology/*economics Organizational Affiliation Private Sector/*economics
23785124,"Reduction in human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence among young women following HPV vaccine introduction in the United States, National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, 2003-2010.",J Infect Dis,Markowitz LE and Hariri S and Lin C and Dunne EF and Steinau M and McQuillan G and Unger ER,cdc,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination was introduced into the routine immunization schedule in the United States in late 2006 for females aged 11 or 12 years, with catch-up vaccination recommended for those aged 13-26 years. In 2010, 3-dose vaccine coverage was only 32% among 13-17 year-olds. Reduction in the prevalence of HPV types targeted by the quadrivalent vaccine (HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18) will be one of the first measures of vaccine impact. METHODS: We analyzed HPV prevalence data from the vaccine era (2007-2010) and the prevaccine era (2003-2006) that were collected during National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. HPV prevalence was determined by the Linear Array HPV Assay in cervicovaginal swab samples from females aged 14-59 years; 4150 provided samples in 2003-2006, and 4253 provided samples in 2007-2010. RESULTS: Among females aged 14-19 years, the vaccine-type HPV prevalence (HPV-6, -11, -16, or -18) decreased from 11.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.2-14.4) in 2003-2006 to 5.1% (95% CI, 3.8-6.6) in 2007-2010, a decline of 56% (95% CI, 38-69). Among other age groups, the prevalence did not differ significantly between the 2 time periods (P > .05). The vaccine effectiveness of at least 1 dose was 82% (95% CI, 53-93).

23733135,Severe lack of comprehension of common prostate health terms among low-income inner-city men.,Cancer,Wang DS and Jani AB and Tai CG and Sesay M and Lee DK and Goodman M and Echt KV and Kilbridge KE and Master VA,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer are often counseled about treatment options with the use of terms that are part of the ""core vocabulary"" of prostate cancer. It is hypothesized that predominantly lower literacy patients would demonstrate a severe lack of comprehension of prostate cancer terms, thus validating the findings of a previous single-institution study. METHODS: A previously developed survey was used to evaluate understanding of terms related to urinary, bowel, and sexual function. The survey was administered by trained evaluators at 2 safety net clinics that provide care for low-income, predominantly African American patients. Comprehension was assessed using semiqualitative methods coded by 2 independent investigators. Literacy and numeracy were also evaluated. RESULTS: Among 109 patients who completed the study, only 5% understood the function of the prostate, and 15%, 29%, and 32% understood the terms ""incontinence,"" ""urinary function,"" and ""bowel habits,"" respectively. Lower levels of comprehension were observed for compound words, such as ""vaginal intercourse"" (58%), versus single words such as ""intercourse"" (95%), validating previous work. Median school level was 13 years, yet median literacy level was only ninth grade, and reading level was significantly correlated with comprehension. Only 30% of patients correctly calculated both a fraction and a percent. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of comprehension of prostate health terminology is pronounced in this patient population and may be widespread. This lack of comprehension potentially limits the ability of patients to participate in informed decision-making. These results validate the findings of previous studies and supports a continued need for refined methods of prostate cancer education.",African Americans/education/*statistics & numerical data Aged *Comprehension Educational Status European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Health Literacy Humans Male Middle Aged *Poverty *Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology Socioeconomic Factors *Terminology as Topic Urban Population/statistics & numerical data *Urogenital System
23787236,Impact of public reporting and outlier status identification on percutaneous coronary intervention case selection in Massachusetts.,JACC Cardiovasc Interv,McCabe JM and Joynt KE and Welt FG and Resnic FS,yale,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the impact of public reporting of hospitals as negative outliers on percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) case-mix selection. BACKGROUND: Public reporting of risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality after PCI is intended to improve outcomes. However, public labeling of negative outliers based on risk-adjusted mortality rates may detrimentally affect hospitals' willingness to care for high-risk patients. METHODS: We used generalized estimating equations to examine expected in-hospital mortality rates for 116,227 PCI patients at all nonfederally funded Massachusetts hospitals performing PCI from 2003 to 2010. The main outcome measure was the change in predicted in-hospital mortality rates per hospital after outlier status identification. RESULTS: The prevalence-weighted mean expected mortality for all PCI cases during the study period was 1.38 +/- 0.36% (5.3 +/- 1.96% for all shock or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients, 0.58 +/- 0.19% for all not shock, not ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients). After public identification as a negative outlier institution, there was an 18% relative reduction (absolute 0.25% reduction) in predicted mortality among PCI patients at outlier institutions (95% confidence interval: -0.04 to -0.46%, p = 0.021) compared with nonoutlier institutions. Throughout the study period, there was an additional 37% relative (0.51% absolute) reduction in the predicted mortality risk among all PCI patients in Massachusetts attributable to secular changes since the onset of public reporting (95% confidence interval: -0.20 to -0.83, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The risk profile of PCI patients at outlier institutions was significantly lower after public identification compared with nonoutlier institutions, suggesting that risk-aversive behaviors among PCI operators at outlier institutions may be an unintended consequence of public reporting in Massachusetts.",*Access to Information *Decision Support Techniques *Hospital Mortality Hospitals/*statistics & numerical data Humans *Mandatory Reporting Massachusetts Multivariate Analysis *Patient Selection Percutaneous Coronary Intervention/adverse effects/*mortality Risk Assessment Risk Factors Treatment Outcome

We describe a cluster of health care-acquired MERS-CoV infections. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for clinical and demographic information and determination of potential contacts and exposures. Case patients and contacts were interviewed. The incubation period and serial interval (the time between the successive onset of symptoms in a chain of transmission) were estimated. Viral RNA was sequenced. RESULTS: Between April 1 and May 23, 2013, a total of 23 cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. Symptoms included fever in 20 patients (87%), cough in 20 (87%), shortness of breath in 11 (48%), and gastrointestinal symptoms in 8 (35%); 20 patients (87%) presented with abnormal chest radiographs. As of June 12, a total of 15 patients (65%) had died, 6 (26%) had recovered, and 2 (9%) remained hospitalized. The median incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9 to 14.7), and the serial interval was 7.6 days (95% CI, 2.5 to 23.1). A total of 21 of the 23 cases were acquired by person-to-person transmission in hemodialysis units, intensive care units, or in-patient units in three different health care facilities. Sequencing data from four isolates revealed a single monophyletic clade. Among 217 household contacts and more than 200 health care worker contacts whom we identified, MERS-CoV infection developed in 5 family members (3 with laboratory-confirmed cases) and in 2 health care workers (both with laboratory-confirmed cases). CONCLUSIONS: Person-to-person transmission of MERS-CoV can occur in health care settings and may be associated with considerable morbidity.

No systematic review has been conducted comparing the effect of dietary and exercise intervention in reducing metabolic risks in overweight children. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of diet-only intervention with those of diet plus exercise or exercise only on weight loss and metabolic risk reduction in overweight children. EVIDENCE REVIEW: English-language articles from 1975 to 2010 available from 7 databases were reviewed. One person searched the databases. Two independent reviewers assessed abstracts and articles against the following eligibility criteria: randomized controlled trials conducted in overweight and obese children aged 18 years or younger, comparing dietary intervention with a diet plus exercise program or an exercise-only program. Study quality was critically appraised by 2 reviewers using established criteria. The main outcome measures were body mass index, body fat percentage, lean body mass, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin. FINDINGS: Fifteen studies were identified and included. Based on the small number of short-term trials currently available, both diet-only and diet plus exercise interventions resulted in weight loss and metabolic profile improvement. However, the addition of exercise to dietary intervention led to greater improvements in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (3.86 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259]; 95% CI, 2.70 to 4.63), fasting glucose (-2.16 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]; 95% CI, -3.78 to -0.72), and fasting insulin (-2.75 muIU/mL [to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 6.945]; 95% CI, -4.50 to -1.00) over 6 months. The diet-only intervention caused greater reductions in levels of triglycerides (at the end of active intervention) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (at subsequent follow-up). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This review provides insights into the impact of dietary and exercise interventions on metabolic risk reduction in the pediatric population. However, further studies are required to confirm the evidence with rigorous design, appropriate sample size, longer duration of follow-up, and better strategies to improve compliance and achieve long-term sustainability.","Adolescent Child *Diet, Reducing *Exercise Humans Obesity/*metabolism/*therapy Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic *Weight Loss"
23739686,Effects of air-pulsed cryotherapy on neuromuscular recovery subsequent to exercise-induced muscle damage.,Am J Sports Med,Guilhem G and Hug F and Couturier A and Regnault S and Bournat L and Filliard JR and Dorel S,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Localized cooling has been proposed as an effective strategy to limit the deleterious effects of exercise-induced muscle damage on neuromuscular function. However, the literature reports conflicting results. PURPOSE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to determine the effects of a new treatment, localized air-pulsed cryotherapy (-30 degrees C), on the recovery time-course of neuromuscular function following a strenuous eccentric exercise. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: A total of 24 participants were included in either a control group (CONT) or a cryotherapy group (CRYO). Immediately after 3 sets of 20 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of elbow flexors, and then 1, 2, and 3 days after exercise, the CRYO group received a cryotherapy treatment (3 x 4 minutes at -30 degrees C separated by 1 minute). The day before and 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 days after exercise, several parameters were quantified: maximal isometric torque and its associated maximal electromyographic activity recorded by a 64-channel electrode, delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), biceps brachii transverse relaxation time (T2) measured using magnetic resonance imaging, creatine kinase activity, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein. RESULTS: Maximal isometric torque decreased similarly for the CONT (-33% +/- 4%) and CRYO groups (-31% +/- 6%). No intergroup differences were found for DOMS, electromyographic activity, creatine kinase activity, and T2 level averaged across the whole biceps brachii. C-reactive protein significantly increased for CONT (+93% at 72 hours, P < .05) but not for CRYO. Spatial analysis showed that cryotherapy delayed the significant increase of T2 and the decrease of electromyographic activity level for CRYO compared with CONT (between day 1 and day 3) in the medio-distal part of the biceps brachii. CONCLUSION: Although some indicators of muscle damage after severe eccentric exercise were delayed (ie, local formation of edema and decrease of muscle activity) by repeated air-pulsed cryotherapy, we provide evidence that this cooling procedure failed to improve long-term recovery of muscle performance. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Four applications of air-pulsed cryotherapy in the 3 days after a strenuous eccentric exercise are ineffective overall in promoting long-term muscle recovery. Further studies taking into account the amount of exercise-induced muscle damage would allow investigators to make stronger conclusions regarding the inefficiency of this recovery modality.","Adult Analysis of Variance Arm Biological Markers/blood Cryotherapy/*methods Electromyography *Exercise Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Muscle Contraction Muscle Strength Dynamometer Muscle, Skeletal/*injuries/physiopathology Recovery of Function Sprains and Strains/blood/etiology/physiopathology/*therapy Treatment Outcome"

No population-based study to date has examined whether early child care spanning the full preschool period from infancy onward is protective for children of depressed mothers. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether early child care moderates associations between maternal depressive symptoms (MDSs) and child internalizing problems (emotional problems [EPs], separation anxiety symptoms, and social withdrawal symptoms [SWSs]) during the preschool period. DESIGN AND SETTING: Population-based prospective cohort study within the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development. PARTICIPANTS: Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development participants (n = 1759) assessed repeatedly between ages 5 and 60 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: High-level trajectories of EPs, SWSs, and separation anxiety symptoms between ages 17 and 60 months. RESULTS: Child care age at entry moderated associations between MDSs and child internalizing problems. Among children of mothers with elevated MDSs, reduced odds ratios for EPs and SWSs were found for those entering child care early (0.24; 95% CI, 0.09-0.66 for EPs and 0.29; 95% CI, 0.09-0.92 for SWSs) or late (0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.77 for EPs and 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.65 for SWSs) compared with those remaining in maternal care. Child care type moderated the association between MDSs and child EPs; children of mothers with elevated MDSs who received group-based child care had lower odds ratios for EPs than those who remained in maternal care (0.21; 95% CI, 0.09-0.48) or those who were cared for by a relative or babysitter (0.40; 95% CI, 0.17-0.94). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Regulated early child care services reduced the risks for internalizing problems for children of mothers with elevated MDSs. Regulated child care services may be used as a public health intervention to buffer the negative effect of maternal depression on children's internalizing problems.","Anxiety, Separation/prevention & control/psychology Child Care/*psychology Child of Impaired Parents/*psychology Child, Preschool Depression/*psychology Emotions/physiology Female Humans Infant Internal-External Control Male Mothers/*psychology Preventive Health Services/*utilization Prospective Studies Quebec Social Behavior Time Factors"
23784448,Impact of screening colonoscopy on outcomes in colon cancer surgery.,JAMA Surg,Amri R and Bordeianou LG and Sylla P and Berger DL,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Screening colonoscopy seemingly decreases colorectal cancer rates in the United States. In addition to removing benign lesions and preventing progression to malignancy, screening colonoscopy theoretically identifies asymptomatic patients with early-stage disease, potentially leading to higher survival rates. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of screening colonoscopy on outcomes of colon cancer surgery by reviewing differences in staging, disease-free interval, risk of recurrence, and survival and to identify whether diagnosis through screening improves long-term outcomes independent of staging. DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospectively maintained, institutional review board-approved database. SETTING: Tertiary care center with high patient volume. PATIENTS: All patients who underwent colon cancer surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2011. INTERVENTION: Colon cancer surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Postoperative staging, death, and recurrence, measured as incidence and time to event. RESULTS: A total of 1071 patients were included, with 217 diagnosed through screening. Patients not diagnosed through screening were at risk for a more invasive tumor (>/=T3: relative risk [RR] = 1.96; P < .001), nodal disease (RR = 1.92; P < .001), and metastatic disease on presentation (RR = 3.37; P < .001). In follow-up, these patients had higher death rates (RR = 3.02; P < .001) and recurrence rates (RR = 2.19; P = .004) as well as shorter survival (P < .001) and disease-free intervals (P < .001). Cox and logistic regression controlling for staging and baseline characteristics revealed that death rate (P = .02) and survival duration (P = .01) were better stage for stage with diagnosis through screening. Death and metastasis rates also remained significantly lower in tumors without nodal or metastatic spread (all P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with colon cancer identified on screening colonoscopy not only have lower-stage disease on presentation but also have better outcomes independent of their staging. Compliance to screening colonoscopy guidelines can play an important role in prolonging longevity, improving quality of life, and reducing health care costs through early detection of colon cancer.","Adenocarcinoma/*diagnosis/*mortality/surgery Aged Aged, 80 and over Colonic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*mortality/surgery *Colonoscopy Disease-Free Survival Female Humans Male *Mass Screening Middle Aged Neoplasm Staging Retrospective Studies Survival Rate Treatment Outcome"

Our objective was to assess the clinical severity of human infections with avian influenza A H7N9 virus, which emerged in China in early 2013. METHODS: We obtained information about laboratory-confirmed cases of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection reported as of May 28, 2013, from an integrated database built by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We estimated the risk of fatality, mechanical ventilation, and admission to the intensive care unit for patients who required hospital admission for medical reasons. We also used information about laboratory-confirmed cases detected through sentinel influenza-like illness surveillance to estimate the symptomatic case fatality risk. FINDINGS: Of 123 patients with laboratory-confirmed avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection who were admitted to hospital, 37 (30%) had died and 69 (56%) had recovered by May 28, 2013. After we accounted for incomplete data for 17 patients who were still in hospital, we estimated the fatality risk for all ages to be 36% (95% CI 26-45) on admission to hospital. Risks of mechanical ventilation or fatality (69%, 95% CI 60-77) and of admission to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or fatality (83%, 76-90) were high. With assumptions about coverage of the sentinel surveillance network and health-care-seeking behaviour for patients with influenza-like illness associated with influenza A H7N9 virus infection, and pro-rata extrapolation, we estimated that the symptomatic case fatality risk could be between 160 (63-460) and 2800 (1000-9400) per 100,000 symptomatic cases. INTERPRETATION: Human infections with avian influenza A H7N9 virus seem to be less serious than has been previously reported. Many mild cases might already have occurred.

23743970,Caffeine-containing medicines increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.,Stroke,Lee SM and Choi NK and Lee BC and Cho KH and Yoon BW and Park BJ,Missing,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Research on the relationship between caffeine-containing medicines (CCMs) and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (HS) is sparse. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between CCMs and the risk of HS. METHODS: We performed a multicenter case-control study in South Korea, from 2002 to 2004. A total of 940 patients with nontraumatic acute HS, aged 30 to 84 years without a history of stroke, 940 community, and 940 hospital controls, age and sex matched to each case, were included. We obtained information on all medications taken in the 14 days before the date (index date) and time of stroke onset (zero-time) for case subjects or matched zero-time for control subjects. Exposure to CCMs was defined by use on the index date before zero-time or during the preceding 3 days. The adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio for the association between the use of CCM and risk for HS was 2.23 (95% CI, 1.41-3.69) for all HS, 2.24 (95% CI, 1.08-4.66) for subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 2.49 (95% CI, 1.29-4.80) for intracerebral hemorrhage. Stratified by daily coffee intake, adjusted odds ratio of CCMs for HS was 2.95 (95% CI, 1.45-5.98) for those who did not drink coffee on a daily basis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that use of CCMs is associated with increased risk of HS, both subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage.",Adult Aged Caffeine/*adverse effects Case-Control Studies Central Nervous System Stimulants/*adverse effects Cerebral Hemorrhage/*chemically induced Female Humans Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Odds Ratio Republic of Korea Risk Stroke/*chemically induced Subarachnoid Hemorrhage/*chemically induced Time Factors

The association between smoking and adverse postoperative outcomes has been confirmed. Whether the associations are dose dependent or restricted to patients with smoking-related disease remains to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between current and past smoking on the risk of postoperative mortality and vascular and respiratory events in patients undergoing major surgery. DESIGN: Cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. We obtained data on smoking history, perioperative risk factors, and 30-day postoperative outcomes. We assessed the effects of current and past smoking (>1 year prior) on postoperative outcomes after adjustment for potential confounders and effect mediators (eg, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer). We also determined whether the effects are dose dependent through analysis of pack-year quintiles. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 607,558 adult patients undergoing major surgery in non-Veterans Affairs hospitals across the United States, Canada, Lebanon, and the United Arab Emirates during 2008 and 2009. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality; secondary outcome measures included arterial events (myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident), venous events (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), and respiratory events (pneumonia, unplanned intubation, or ventilator requirement >48 hours). RESULTS: The sample included 125,192 current (20.6%) and 78,763 past (13.0%) smokers. Increased odds of postoperative mortality were noted in current smokers only (odds ratio, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.10-1.24]). When we compared current and past smokers, the adjusted odds ratios were higher in the former for arterial events (1.65 [95% CI, 1.51-1.81] vs 1.20 [1.09-1.31], respectively) and respiratory events (1.45 [1.40-1.51] vs 1.13 [1.08-1.18], respectively). No effects on venous events were observed. The effects of smoking mediated through smoking-related disease were minimal. The increased adjusted odds of mortality in current smokers were evident from a smoking history of less than 10 pack-years, whereas the effects of smoking on arterial and respiratory events were incremental with increased pack-years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Smoking cessation at least 1 year before major surgery abolishes the increased risk of postoperative mortality and decreases the risk of arterial and respiratory events evident in current smokers. These findings should be carried forward to evaluate the value and cost-effectiveness of intervention in this setting. Our study should increase awareness of the detrimental effects of smoking-and the benefits of its cessation-on morbidity and mortality in the surgical setting.","Adult Aged Canada Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology Cohort Studies Female Humans Lebanon Male Middle Aged Pneumonia/*epidemiology Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology Respiration, Artificial Risk Factors Smoking/*adverse effects/*mortality United Arab Emirates United States"

23797716,Contribution of preventable acute care spending to total spending for high-cost Medicare patients.,JAMA,Joynt KE and Gawande AA and Orav EJ and Jha AK,partners,"IMPORTANCE: A small proportion of patients account for the majority of US health care spending, and understanding patterns of spending among this cohort is critical to reducing health care costs. The degree to which preventable acute care services account for spending among these patients is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To quantify preventable acute care services among high-cost Medicare patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We summed standardized costs for each inpatient and outpatient service contained in standard 5% Medicare files from 2009 and 2010 across the year for each patient in our sample, and defined those in the top decile of spending in 2010 as high-cost patients and those in the top decile in both 2009 and 2010 as persistently high-cost patients. We used standard algorithms to identify potentially preventable emergency department (ED) visits and acute care inpatient hospitalizations. A total of 1,114,469 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years or older were included. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of acute care hospital and ED costs deemed preventable among high-cost patients. RESULTS: The 10% of Medicare patients in the high-cost group were older, more often male, more often black, and had more comorbid illnesses than non-high-cost patients. In 2010, 32.9% (95% CI, 32.9%-32.9%) of total ED costs were incurred by high-cost patients. Based on validated algorithms, 41.0% (95% CI, 40.9%-41.0%) of these costs among high-cost patients were potentially preventable compared with 42.6% (95% CI, 42.6%-42.6%) among non-high-cost patients. High-cost patients accounted for 79.0% (95% CI, 79.0%-79.0%) of inpatient costs, 9.6% (95% CI, 9.6%-9.6%) of which were due to preventable hospitalizations; 16.8% (95% CI, 16.8%-16.8%) of costs within the non-high-cost group were due to preventable hospitalizations. Comparable proportions of ED spending (43.3%; 95% CI, 43.3%-43.3%) and inpatient spending (13.5%; 95% CI, 13.5%-13.5%) were preventable among persistently high-cost patients. Regions with high primary care physician supply had higher preventable spending for high-cost patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among a sample of patients in the top decile of Medicare spending in 2010, only a small percentage of costs appeared to be related to preventable ED visits and hospitalizations. The ability to lower costs for these patients through better outpatient care may be limited.","Acute Disease/therapy Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Algorithms Ambulatory Care/economics/statistics & numerical data *Cost Control Emergency Service, Hospital/*economics/utilization Fee-for-Service Plans/statistics & numerical data Female Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data Health Expenditures/*statistics & numerical data Hospitalization/*economics/statistics & numerical data Humans Male Medicare Primary Health Care/statistics & numerical data Risk Sex Factors United States"
23801825,Trends in age-specific coronary heart disease mortality in the European Union over three decades: 1980-2009.,Eur Heart J,Nichols M and Townsend N and Scarborough P and Rayner M,Missing,"AIMS: Recent decades have seen very large declines in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality across most of Europe, partly due to declines in risk factors such as smoking. Cardiovascular diseases (predominantly CHD and stroke), remain, however, the main cause of death in most European countries, and many risk factors for CHD, particularly obesity, have been increasing substantially over the same period. It is hypothesized that observed reductions in CHD mortality have occurred largely within older age groups, and that rates in younger groups may be plateauing or increasing as the gains from reduced smoking rates are increasingly cancelled out by increasing rates of obesity and diabetes. The aim of this study was to examine sex-specific trends in CHD mortality between 1980 and 2009 in the European Union (EU) and compare trends between adult age groups. METHODS: Sex-specific data from the WHO global mortality database were analysed using the joinpoint software to examine trends and significant changes in trends in age-standardized mortality rates. Specific age groups analysed were: under 45, 45-54, 55-64, and 65 years and over. The number and location of significant joinpoints for each country by sex and age group was determined (maximum of 3) using a log-linear model, and the annual percentage change within each segment calculated. Average annual percentage change overall (1980-2009) and separately for each decade were calculated with respect to the underlying joinpoint model. RESULTS: Recent CHD rates are now less than half what they were in the early 1980s in many countries, in younger adult age groups as well as in the population overall. Trends in mortality rates vary markedly between EU countries, but less so between age groups and sexes within countries. Fifteen countries showed evidence of a recent plateauing of trends in at least one age group for men, as did 12 countries for women. This did not, however, appear to be any more common in younger age groups compared with older adults. There was little evidence to support the hypothesis that mortality rates have recently begun to plateau in younger age groups in the EU as a whole, although such plateaus and even a small number of increases in CHD mortality in younger subpopulations were observed in a minority of countries. CONCLUSION: There is limited evidence to support the hypothesis that CHD mortality rates in younger age groups in the member states of the EU have been more likely to plateau than in older age groups. There are, however, substantial and persistent inequalities between countries. It remains vitally important for the whole EU to monitor and work towards reducing preventable risk factors for CHD and other chronic conditions to promote wellbeing and equity across the region.",Adult Age Distribution Aged Cohort Effect Coronary Disease/*epidemiology Europe/epidemiology European Union/statistics & numerical data Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mortality/trends Sex Distribution Survival Rate

We investigated patient expectations about the goals of RT for incurable lung cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium enrolled a population- and health system-based cohort of patients diagnosed with lung cancer from 2003 to 2005. We identified patients with stage wet IIIB or IV lung cancer who received RT and answered questions on their expectations about RT. We assessed patient expectations about the goals of RT and identified factors associated with inaccurate beliefs about cure. RESULTS: In all, 384 patients completed surveys on their expectations about RT. Seventy-eight percent of patients believed that RT was very or somewhat likely to help them live longer, and 67% believed that RT was very or somewhat likely to help them with problems related to their cancer. However, 64% did not understand that RT was not at all likely to cure them. Older patients and nonwhites were more likely to have inaccurate beliefs, and patients whose surveys were completed by surrogates were less likely to have inaccurate beliefs. Ninety-two percent of patients with inaccurate beliefs about cure from RT also had inaccurate beliefs about chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Although patients receiving RT for incurable lung cancer believe it will help them, most do not understand that it is not at all likely to cure their disease.

It is not known whether this extends to younger women. OBJECTIVE: To test whether prescribing CEE-based hormone therapy to postmenopausal women aged 50 to 55 years has longer-term effects on cognitive function. DESIGN: Trained, masked staff assessed participants with an annual telephone-administered cognitive battery that included measures of global and domain-specific cognitive functions. Cognitive testing was conducted an average of 7.2 years after the trials ended, when women had a mean age of 67.2 years, and repeated 1 year later. Enrollment occurred from 1996 through 1999. SETTING: Forty academic research centers. PARTICIPANTS: The study population comprised 1326 postmenopausal women, who had begun treatment in 2 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hormone therapy when aged 50 to 55 years. INTERVENTION: The clinical trials in which the women had participated had compared 0.625 mg CEE with or without 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate over a mean of 7.0 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was global cognitive function. Secondary outcomes were verbal memory, attention, executive function, verbal fluency, and working memory. RESULTS: Global cognitive function scores from women who had been assigned to CEE-based therapies were similar to those from women assigned to placebo: mean (95% CI) intervention effect of 0.02 (-0.08 to 0.12) standard deviation units (P = .66). Similarly, no overall differences were found for any individual cognitive domain (all P > .15). Prespecified subgroup analyses found some evidence that CEE-based therapies may have adversely affected verbal fluency among women who had prior hysterectomy or prior use of hormone therapy: mean treatment effects of -0.17 (-0.33 to -0.02) and -0.25 (-0.42 to -0.08), respectively; however, this may be a chance finding. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: CEE-based therapies produced no overall sustained benefit or risk to cognitive function when administered to postmenopausal women aged 50 to 55 years. We are not able to address whether initiating hormone therapy during menopause and maintaining therapy until any symptoms are passed affects cognitive function, either in the short or longer term.

A therapy for T1D that targets the specific autoimmune response in this disease while leaving the remainder of the immune system intact, has long been sought. Proinsulin is a major target of the adaptive immune response in T1D. We hypothesized that an engineered DNA plasmid encoding proinsulin (BHT-3021) would preserve beta cell function in T1D patients through reduction of insulin-specific CD8(+) T cells. We studied 80 subjects over 18 years of age who were diagnosed with T1D within the past 5 years. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive intramuscular injections of BHT-3021 or BHT-placebo, weekly for 12 weeks, and then monitored for safety and immune responses in a blinded fashion. Four dose levels of BHT-3021 were evaluated: 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 mg. C-peptide was used both as an exploratory efficacy measure and as a safety measure. Islet-specific CD8(+) T cell frequencies were assessed with multimers of monomeric human leukocyte antigen class I molecules loaded with peptides from pancreatic and unrelated antigens. No serious adverse events related to BHT-3021 were observed. C-peptide levels improved relative to placebo at all doses, at 1 mg at the 15-week time point (+19.5% BHT-3021 versus -8.8% BHT-placebo, P < 0.026). Proinsulin-reactive CD8(+) T cells, but not T cells against unrelated islet or foreign molecules, declined in the BHT-3021 arm (P < 0.006). No significant changes were noted in interferon-gamma, interleukin-4 (IL-4), or IL-10 production in CD4 T cells. Thus, we demonstrate that a plasmid encoding proinsulin reduces the frequency of CD8(+) T cells reactive to proinsulin while preserving C-peptide over the course of dosing.","Adult C-Peptide/*metabolism CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*immunology/*therapy Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Female Humans Male Plasmids/*genetics Proinsulin/genetics/*metabolism"

To explore whether race-based health disparities exist among men with very low-risk PCa, we evaluated oncologic outcomes of AA men with very low-risk PCa who were candidates for AS but elected to undergo radical prostatectomy (RP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 1,801 men (256 AA, 1,473 white men, and 72 others) who met National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria for very low-risk PCa and underwent RP. Presenting characteristics, pathologic data, and cancer recurrence were compared among the groups. Multivariable modeling was performed to assess the association of race with upgrading and adverse pathologic features. RESULTS: AA men with very low-risk PCa had more adverse pathologic features at RP and poorer oncologic outcomes. AA men were more likely to experience disease upgrading at prostatectomy (27.3% v 14.4%; P <.001), positive surgical margins (9.8% v 5.9%; P =.02), and higher Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Post-Surgical scoring system (CAPRA-S) scores. On multivariable analysis, AA race was an independent predictor of adverse pathologic features (odds ratio, [OR], 3.23; P =.03) and pathologic upgrading (OR, 2.26; P =.03). CONCLUSION: AA men with very low-risk PCa who meet criteria for AS but undergo immediate surgery experience significantly higher rates of upgrading and adverse pathology than do white men and men of other races. AA men with very low-risk PCa should be counseled about increased oncologic risk when deciding among their disease management options.",Missing

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, parallel assignment, controlled trial. SETTING: Private IVF center. PATIENT(S): A total of 240 patients undergoing a first IVF cycle with OD in our center. INTERVENTION(S): Ten minutes of bed rest after ET or no bed rest, that is, allowing patients to ambulate immediately after the ET. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The primary outcome was LBI rate per randomized patient. Secondary outcomes were implantation rate and biochemical and clinical miscarriage rates. RESULT(S): LBI rates (56.7% vs. 41.6%) were observed to be significantly higher in the no rest (NR) group than in the rest (R) group. And lower miscarriage rates (18.3% vs. 27.5%) were shown in the NR when compared with the R group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Neonatal characteristics like height, weight, and Apgar score were similar in both the groups. Comparable implantation rates were obtained with or without BR after ET. CONCLUSION(S): The statistically significant higher LBI rate shown in our NR group confirms that 10 minutes of bed rest immediately after ET has no positive effect and in fact can be negative for the outcome of IVF with OD.

METHODS: National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program data for 2001-2010 were analyzed. Numbers and rates of injuries were examined by age group, gender, primary body part injured, diagnosis, and hospital admission status. RESULTS: During 2001-2010, an estimated 361,161 ATV riders aged </= 15 years were treated in EDs for ATV-related injuries. The injury rate peaked at 67 per 100,000 children in 2004 and then declined to 42 per 100,000 children by 2010. The annualized injury rate for boys was double that of girls (73 vs 37 per 100,000). Children aged 11 to 15 years accounted for two-thirds of all ED visits and hospitalizations. Fractures accounted for 28% of ED visits and 45% of hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: The reasons for the decline in ATV-related injuries among young riders are not well understood but might be related to the economic recession of the mid-2000s and decreased sales of new ATVs. Although many states have regulations governing children's use of ATVs, their effectiveness in reducing injuries is unclear. Broader use of known effective safety measures, including prohibiting children aged </= 15 years from riding adult-sized ATVs, always wearing a helmet while riding, not riding on paved roads, and not riding as or carrying a passenger could additionally reduce ATV-related injuries among children.

Therefore, we assessed the literature to test whether whole grains alone had benefits on these diseases. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the contribution of bran or cereal fiber on the impact of whole grains on the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity and body weight measures, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in human studies as the basis for establishing an American Society for Nutrition (ASN) position on this subject. DESIGN: We performed a comprehensive PubMed search of human studies published from 1965 to December 2010. RESULTS: Most whole-grain studies included mixtures of whole grains and foods with >/=25% bran. Prospective studies consistently showed a reduced risk of T2D with high intakes of cereal fiber or mixtures of whole grains and bran. For body weight, a limited number of prospective studies on cereal fiber and whole grains reported small but significant reductions in weight gain. For CVD, studies found reduced risk with high intakes of cereal fiber or mixtures of whole grains and bran. CONCLUSIONS: The ASN position, based on the current state of the science, is that consumption of foods rich in cereal fiber or mixtures of whole grains and bran is modestly associated with a reduced risk of obesity, T2D, and CVD. The data for whole grains alone are limited primarily because of varying definitions among epidemiologic studies of what, and how much, was included in that food category.","Cardiovascular Diseases/*prevention & control *Cereals Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*prevention & control Dietary Fiber/*administration & dosage Humans Obesity/*prevention & control Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Risk Reduction Behavior Weight Gain"
23739216,Ambient temperature and congenital heart defects.,Hum Reprod,Agay-Shay K and Friger M and Linn S and Peled A and Amitai Y and Peretz C,Missing,"STUDY QUESTION: Does maternal exposure during pregnancy to higher ambient temperature increase the risk of congenital heart defects (CHDs)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Significant associations were found between maternal exposure during pregnancy to higher ambient temperature and CHDs risk especially during the cold season. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: From rodents to non-human primates, a teratogenic effect of hyperthermic insult has been demonstrated. There are fewer data regarding the effect on the human fetus and specifically the association between maternal exposures during pregnancy to higher ambient temperature and CHDs. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This population registry-based cohort study included 135 527 live and stillbirths in the Tel-Aviv region of Israel in 2000-2006. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Two clinical diagnostic groups of isolated cardiac defects (atrial septal defects and ventricular septal defects: n = 542 and 481, respectively) and one group of multiple cardiac defects (defined by the presence of two or more cardiac malformations, n = 607) were studied. Temperature measurements were constructed from ambient stations and used to assess the impact of maternal exposure to average ambient temperature and extreme heat events (daily average temperature above the 90th percentile) during Weeks 3-8 of pregnancy on risk of CHDs. Logistic models, adjusted for sociodemographic covariates, were used to evaluate the associations between temperature and CHDs. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Overall, we found no significant associations between ambient temperature and CHDs throughout the year, with one exception for multiple CHDs. After stratifying by season of conception, continuous exposure to average ambient temperature and maximum peak temperature (1 degrees C increase) during the cold season increased the risk for multiple CHDs [odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.10 and OR 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.05, respectively]. A 1-day increase in extreme heat events increased the risk for multiple CHDs (OR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.21) and also for isolated atrial septal defects (OR 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.19). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Information both on CHD cases and on ambient temperature was based on registries and it is possible that this may cause some misclassification. In urban areas, pregnant women may be exposed to higher temperatures than recorded by ambient monitors because of the 'heat island effect'. Furthermore, data for the amount of time spent indoors were unavailable and this could have resulted in exposure misclassification. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The findings are important within the context of global climate change, which may have implications for public health in countries with mild winters and hot summers. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was supported by the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection (research grant-7-2-7) and by the Environment and Health Fund (PhD Fellowship Program).

RESULTS: A total of 1,785 stents were implanted in 1,145 patients; 60.8% were DES. More DES per case were implanted when a representative was present (1.71 +/- 0.9 vs 1.60 +/- 0.93, P = .023). There was no difference in the utilization of balloons and bare-metal stents between groups. Stent cost per case was higher when a representative was present (Can $1,703.5 +/- 1,314.4 vs 1,468.9 +/- 1,273.3, P < .001). For all companies marketing DES, there was increase in the use of the company's DES when their sale representative was present with less use of the competitors' stents. CONCLUSIONS: Sale representative presence was associated with increased use of the representative company's stents during percutaneous coronary interventions. The effect was more pronounced on use of the company's DES and resulted in higher procedural cost.","Aged Antibodies/administration & dosage Antigens, CD34/immunology Commerce Drug-Eluting Stents/*utilization Female Humans *Industry Male Middle Aged Percutaneous Coronary Intervention/*instrumentation Retrospective Studies Stents/*utilization"
23821091,Autism and mental retardation among offspring born after in vitro fertilization.,JAMA,Sandin S and Nygren KG and Iliadou A and Hultman CM and Reichenberg A,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Between 1978 and 2010, approximately 5 million infants were born after in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. Yet limited information on neurodevelopment after IVF exists, especially after the first year of life. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between use of any IVF and different IVF procedures and the risk of autistic disorder and mental retardation in the offspring. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A population-based, prospective cohort study using Swedish national health registers. Offspring born between 1982 and 2007 were followed up for a clinical diagnosis of autistic disorder or mental retardation until December 31, 2009. The exposure of interest was IVF, categorized according to whether intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for male infertility was used and whether embryos were fresh or frozen. For ICSI, whether sperm were ejaculated or surgically extracted was also considered. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Relative risks (RRs) for autistic disorder and mental retardation and rates per 100,000 person-years, comparing spontaneously conceived offspring with those born after an IVF procedure and comparing 5 IVF procedures used in Sweden vs IVF without ICSI with fresh embryo transfer, the most common treatment. We also analyzed the subgroup restricted to singletons. RESULTS: Of the more than 2.5 million infants born, 30,959 (1.2%) were conceived by IVF and were followed up for a mean 10 (SD, 6) years. Overall, 103 of 6959 children (1.5%) with autistic disorder and 180 of 15,830 (1.1%) with mental retardation were conceived by IVF. The RR for autistic disorder after any procedure compared with spontaneous conception was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.94-1.39; 19.0 vs 15.6 per 100,000 person-years). The RR for mental retardation was 1.18 (95% CI, 1.01-1.36; 46.3 vs 39.8 per 100,000 person-years). For both outcomes, there was no statistically significant association when restricting analysis to singletons. Compared with IVF without ICSI with fresh embryo transfer, there were statistically significantly increased risks of autistic disorder following ICSI using surgically extracted sperm and fresh embryos (RR, 4.60 [95% CI, 2.14-9.88]; 135.7 vs 29.3 per 100,000 person-years); for mental retardation following ICSI using surgically extracted sperm and fresh embryos (RR, 2.35 [95% CI, 1.01-5.45]; 144.1 vs 60.8 per 100,000 person-years); and following ICSI using ejaculated sperm and fresh embryos (RR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.03-2.09]; 90.6 vs 60.8 per 100,000 person-years). When restricting the analysis to singletons, the risks of autistic disorder associated with ICSI using surgically extracted sperm were not statistically significant, but the risks associated with ICSI using frozen embryos were significant for mental retardation (with frozen embryos, RR, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.04-5.36], 118.4 vs 50.6 per 100,000 person-years]; with fresh embryos, RR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.00-2.57], 80.0 vs 50.6 per 100,000 person-years). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with spontaneous conception, IVF treatment overall was not associated with autistic disorder but was associated with a small but statistically significantly increased risk of mental retardation. For specific procedures, IVF with ICSI for paternal infertility was associated with a small increase in the RR for autistic disorder and mental retardation compared with IVF without ICSI. The prevalence of these disorders was low, and the increase in absolute risk associated with IVF was small.","Adult Autistic Disorder/*epidemiology Child Child, Preschool Embryo Transfer Female *Fertilization in Vitro Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Infertility, Male Intellectual Disability/*epidemiology Male Prevalence Prospective Studies Registries/statistics & numerical data Risk *Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic Sweden/epidemiology"
23803882,Association between water consumption and body weight outcomes: a systematic review.,Am J Clin Nutr,Muckelbauer R and Sarganas G and Gruneis A and Muller-Nordhorn J,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Drinking water is often applied as a dietary means for weight loss and overweight/obesity prevention, but no evidence-based recommendation exists for this indication. OBJECTIVE: We summarized the existing evidence on the association between water consumption and body weight outcomes in adults of any body weight status. DESIGN: In a systematic review, we retrieved studies from 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and COCHRANE), cross-references by PubMed functions and hand-searching, and experts' recommendations. Any type of study including adults aged >18 y that reported the association between daily water consumption and any weight-related outcome, such as body weight, body mass index, or body weight classifications, was eligible. RESULTS: Of 4963 retrieved records, 11 original studies and 2 systematic reviews were included. In participants dieting for weight loss or maintenance, a randomized controlled trial, a nonrandomized controlled trial, and an observational longitudinal study showed that increased water consumption, in addition to a program for weight loss or maintenance, reduced body weight after 3-12 mo compared with such a program alone. In mixed-weight populations not primarily dieting for weight loss or maintenance, 2 short-term randomized trials showed no effect of water consumption on body weight; 6 cross-sectional studies showed inconsistent results. CONCLUSIONS: Studies of individuals dieting for weight loss or maintenance suggest a weight-reducing effect of increased water consumption, whereas studies in general mixed-weight populations yielded inconsistent results. The evidence for this association is still low, mostly because of the lack of good-quality studies.

DESIGN: Seventeen overweight men (body mass index: 27.7+/-1.6 kg m(-2); body mass: 89.8+/-10.1 kg; body fat: 30.0+/-4.3%; VO(2peak): 39.2+/-4.8 ml kg(-1) min(-1)) completed four 30-min experimental conditions using a randomised counterbalanced design. CON: resting control, MC: continuous moderate-intensity exercise (60% VO(2peak)), HI: high-intensity intermittent exercise (alternating 60 s at 100% VO(2peak) and 240 s at 50% VO(2peak)), VHI: very-high-intensity intermittent exercise (alternating 15 s at 170% VO(2peak) and 60 s at 32% VO(2peak)). Participants consumed a standard caloric meal following exercise/CON and an ad-libitum meal 70 min later. Capillary blood was sampled and perceived appetite assessed at regular time intervals throughout the session. Free-living energy intake and physical activity levels for the experimental day and the day after were also assessed. RESULTS: Ad-libitum energy intake was lower after HI and VHI compared with CON (P=0.038 and P=0.004, respectively), and VHI was also lower than MC (P=0.028). Free-living energy intake in the subsequent 38 h remained less after VHI compared with CON and MC (P</=0.050). These observations were associated with lower active ghrelin (P</=0.050), higher blood lactate (P</=0.014) and higher blood glucose (P</=0.020) after VHI compared with all other trials. Despite higher heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) during HI and VHI compared with MC (P</=0.004), ratings of physical activity enjoyment were similar between all the exercise trials (P=0.593). No differences were found in perceived appetite between trials. CONCLUSIONS: High-intensity intermittent exercise suppresses subsequent ad-libitum energy intake in overweight inactive men. This format of exercise was found to be well tolerated in an overweight population.",Missing
23755956,The status of public reporting of clinical outcomes in assisted reproductive technology.,Fertil Steril,Kushnir VA and Vidali A and Barad DH and Gleicher N,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the transparency of assisted reproductive technology (ART) surveillance reports published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART). DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Private clinical ART and research center. PATIENT(S): We analyzed ART data for the years 2005-2010, which were reported under federal mandate to the CDC (818,927 completed cycles) and voluntarily to SART (812,400 initiated cycles). INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Initiated cycles excluded from final outcome reporting were used to evaluate transparency. RESULT(S): Only SART, but not CDC, reported initiated cycles, allowing analysis of excluded cycles. Excluded cycles increased significantly from 3.3% to 7.4% between 2005 and 2010. By 2010, 13/341 (3.8%) ART centers accounted for 50% of excluded cycles, representing an average of 37.3% of their cycles. These 13 clinics reported significantly better pregnancy and cancellations rates than national averages and collectively increased by 19.9% their share of U.S. ART cycles. CONCLUSION(S): Our data indicate decreasing transparency in public ART reporting in the United States, likely due to changes in practice and reporting patterns. A few clinics accounted for the majority of excluded cycles, leading to improved reported clinical outcomes and increasing market share. CDC and SART should ensure that all ART clinics publicly report the outcomes of all initiated cycles including embryo-banking cycles. ART surveillance and quality of care may be improved by prospectively tracking the total reproductive potential of each initiated cycle.","Access to Information/legislation & jurisprudence Adult Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)/legislation & jurisprudence Disclosure/legislation & jurisprudence/standards/statistics & numerical data Female Humans Infertility/*epidemiology/*therapy *Mandatory Reporting Pregnancy Registries/*standards/statistics & numerical data *Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical data Retrospective Studies Treatment Outcome United States/epidemiology"
23830354,Risk factors for congenital anomaly in a multiethnic birth cohort: an analysis of the Born in Bradford study.,Lancet,Sheridan E and Wright J and Small N and Corry PC and Oddie S and Whibley C and Petherick ES and Malik T and Pawson N and McKinney PA and Parslow RC,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Congenital anomalies are a leading cause of infant death and disability and their incidence varies between ethnic groups in the UK. Rates of infant death are highest in children of Pakistani origin, and congenital anomalies are the most common cause of death in children younger than 12 in this ethnic group. We investigated the incidence of congenital anomalies in a large multiethnic birth cohort to identify the causes of the excess of congenital anomalies in this community. METHODS: We obtained questionnaire data from the mothers of children with one or more anomalies from the Born in Bradford study, a prospective birth cohort study of 13,776 babies and their families in which recruitment was undertaken between 2007 and 2011. Details of anomalies were prospectively reported to the study and we cross checked these details against medical records. We linked data for anomalies to maternal questionnaire and clinical data gathered as part of the Born in Bradford study. We calculated univariate and multivariate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs for various maternal risk factors. FINDINGS: Of 11,396 babies for whom questionnaire data were available, 386 (3%) had a congenital anomaly. Rates for congenital anomaly were 305.74 per 10,000 livebirths, compared with a national rate of 165.90 per 10,000. The risk was greater for mothers of Pakistani origin than for those of white British origin (univariate RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.56-2.46). Overall, 2013 (18%) babies were the offspring of first-cousin unions. These babies were mainly of Pakistani origin--1922 (37%) of 5127 babies of Pakistani origin had parents in first-cousin unions. Consanguinity was associated with a doubling of risk for congenital anomaly (multivariate RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.67-2.85); we noted no association with increasing deprivation. 31% of all anomalies in children of Pakistani origin could be attributed to consanguinity. We noted a similar increase in risk for mothers of white British origin older than 34 years (multivariate RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.14-3.00). Maternal education to degree level was protective (0.53, 95% CI 0.38-0.75), irrespective of ethnic origin. INTERPRETATION: Consanguinity is a major risk factor for congenital anomaly. The risk remains even after adjustment for deprivation, and accounts for almost a third of anomalies in babies of Pakistani origin. High levels of educational attainment are associated with reduced risk in all ethnic groups. Our findings will be valuable in health promotion and public health, and to those commissioning antenatal, paediatric, and clinical genetic services. Sensitive advice about the risks should be provided to communities at increased risk, and to couples in consanguineous unions, to assist in reproductive decision making.

23831141,Interhuman transmissibility of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: estimation of pandemic risk.,Lancet,Breban R and Riou J and Fontanet A,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection shares many clinical, epidemiological, and virological similarities with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV. We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS. METHODS: We retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks. To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS. We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data. RESULTS: With our most pessimistic scenario (scenario 2), we estimated MERS-CoV R0 to be 0.69 (95% CI 0.50-0.92); by contrast, the R0 for prepandemic SARS-CoV was 0.80 (0.54-1.13). Our optimistic scenario (scenario 1) yielded a MERS-CoV R0 of 0.60 (0.42-0.80). Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient. Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R0 would exceed 1--ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential. We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.

The Chinese Medicine Neuroaid Efficacy on Stroke recovery (CHIMES) study tested the hypothesis that MLC601 is superior to placebo in acute, moderately severe ischemic stroke within a 72-hour time window. METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized 1100 patients with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 6 to 14, within 72 hours of onset, to trial medications for 3 months. The primary outcome was a shift in the modified Rankin Scale. Secondary outcomes were modified Rankin Scale dichotomy, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improvement, difference in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale total and motor scores, Barthel index, and mini-mental state examination. Planned subgroup analyses were performed according to age, sex, time to first dose, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, presence of cortical signs, and antiplatelet use. RESULTS: The modified Rankin Scale shift analysis-adjusted odds ratio was 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 0.86-1.32). Statistical difference was not detected between the treatment groups for any of the secondary outcomes. Subgroup analyses showed no statistical heterogeneity for the primary outcome; however, a trend toward benefit in the subgroup receiving treatment beyond 48 hours from stroke onset was noted. Serious and nonserious adverse events rates were similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: MLC601 is statistically no better than placebo in improving outcomes at 3 months when used among patients with acute ischemic stroke of intermediate severity. Longer treatment duration and follow-up of participants with treatment initiated after 48 hours may be considered in future studies. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

23783296,Effects of long-chain PUFA supplementation in infant formula on cognitive function in later childhood.,Am J Clin Nutr,Willatts P and Forsyth S and Agostoni C and Casaer P and Riva E and Boehm G,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Evidence is accumulating that a dietary supply of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) enhances the development of attention and efficient information processing in infants. However, it is uncertain whether LC-PUFAs in infancy influence cognitive development in later childhood. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the effects of dietary LC-PUFAs in infancy on measures of cognitive function at age 6 y. DESIGN: Infants were randomly assigned to receive formula containing either docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid or no LCPUFAs for a period of 4 mo. A reference breastfed group was also included. In a follow-up conducted at age 6 y, children received assessments of intelligence quotient (IQ), attention control (Day-Night Test), and speed of processing on the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT). RESULTS: At follow-up there were 71 children in the LC-PUFA group, 76 in the control group, and 88 in the breastfed group. The formula groups did not differ on measures of Full-Scale IQ (LCPUFA mean = 98.0; control mean = 100.9) or attention control (LCPUFA mean = 12.7; control mean = 12.8). MFFT error scores were the same for both formula groups, but when making correct responses, the LC-PUFA group was significantly faster (mean = 6.2 s) than the control group [mean = 7.8 s; F(1, 131) = 6.09, P = 0.015]. CONCLUSIONS: IQ scores of children who were fed a formula containing either LC-PUFAs or no LC-PUFAs did not differ at age 6 y. However, children who received LC-PUFAs were faster at processing information compared with children who received unsupplemented formula. Variation in the dietary supply of LC-PUFAs in the first months of life may have long-term consequences for the development of some cognitive functions in later childhood.","Arachidonic Acid/*administration & dosage Breast Feeding Child Child, Preschool Cognition/*drug effects Diet *Dietary Supplements Docosahexaenoic Acids/*administration & dosage Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Infant Infant Formula/*chemistry Intelligence Tests Male"

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether daily consumption of a soy protein isolate supplement for 2 years reduces the rate of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy or delays such recurrence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind trial conducted from July 1997 to May 2010 at 7 US centers comparing daily consumption of a soy protein supplement vs placebo in 177 men at high risk of recurrence after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Supplement intervention was started within 4 months after surgery and continued for up to 2 years, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements made at 2-month intervals in the first year and every 3 months thereafter. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to receive a daily serving of a beverage powder containing 20 g of protein in the form of either soy protein isolate (n=87) or, as placebo, calcium caseinate (n=90). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Biochemical recurrence rate of prostate cancer (defined as development of a PSA level of >/=0.07 ng/mL) over the first 2 years following randomization and time to recurrence. RESULTS: The trial was stopped early for lack of treatment effects at a planned interim analysis with 81 evaluable participants in the intervention group and 78 in the placebo group. Overall, 28.3% of participants developed biochemical recurrence within 2 years of entering the trial (close to the a priori predicted recurrence rate of 30%). Among these, 22 (27.2%) occurred in the intervention group and 23 (29.5%) in the placebo group. The resulting hazard ratio for active treatment was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.53-1.72; log-rank P = .89). Adherence was greater than 90% and there were no apparent adverse events related to supplementation. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Daily consumption of a beverage powder supplement containing soy protein isolate for 2 years following radical prostatectomy did not reduce biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer in men at high risk of PSA failure.

23837185,Changes in language services use by US pediatricians.,Pediatrics,DeCamp LR and Kuo DZ and Flores G and O'Connor K and Minkovitz CS,jhmi,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Access to appropriate language services is critical for ensuring patient safety and reducing the impact of language barriers. This study compared language services use by US pediatricians in 2004 and 2010 and examined variation in use in 2010 by pediatrician, practice, and state characteristics. METHODS: We used data from 2 national surveys of pediatricians (2004: n = 698; 2010: n = 683). Analysis was limited to postresidency pediatricians with patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). Pediatricians reported use of >/= 1 communication methods with LEP patients: bilingual family member, staff, physician, formal interpreter (professional, telephone), and primary-language written materials. Bivariate analyses examined 2004 to 2010 changes in methods used, and 2010 use by characteristics of pediatricians (age, sex, ethnicity), practices (type, location, patient demographics), and states (LEP population, Latino population growth, Medicaid/Children's Health Insurance Program language services reimbursement). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine adjusted odds of use of each method. RESULTS: Most pediatricians reported using family members to communicate with LEP patients and families, but there was a decrease from 2004 to 2010 (69.6%, 57.1%, P < .01). A higher percentage of pediatricians reported formal interpreter use (professional and/or telephone) in 2010 (55.8%) than in 2004 (49.7%, P < .05); the increase was primarily attributable to increased telephone interpreter use (28.2%, 37.8%, P < .01). Pediatricians in states with reimbursement had twice the odds of formal interpreter use versus those in nonreimbursing states (odds ratio 2.34; 95% confidence interval 1.24-4.40). CONCLUSIONS: US pediatricians' use of appropriate language services has only modestly improved since 2004.

METHODS: This was a cohort study in Northern Italy on more than 1 million residents. Cancer incidence was derived from the local health authority (ASL-Mi1) tumor registry and AD dementia incidence from registries of drug prescriptions, hospitalizations, and payment exemptions. Expected cases of AD dementia were calculated by applying the age-, sex-, and calendar year-specific incidence rates observed in the whole population to the subgroup constituted of persons with newly diagnosed cancers during the observation period (2004-2009). The same calculations were carried out for cancers in patients with AD dementia. Separate analyses were carried out for the time period preceding or following the index diagnosis for survivors and nonsurvivors until the end of 2009 and for different types and sites of cancer. RESULTS: The risk of cancer in patients with AD dementia was halved, and the risk of AD dementia in patients with cancer was 35% reduced. This relationship was observed in almost all subgroup analyses, suggesting that some anticipated potential confounding factors did not significantly influence the results. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of both cancer and AD dementia increases exponentially with age, but with an inverse relationship; older persons with cancer have a reduced risk of AD dementia and vice versa. As AD dementia and cancer are negative hallmarks of aging and senescence, we suggest that AD dementia, cancer, and senescence could be manifestations of a unique phenomenon related to human aging.","Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Alzheimer Disease/*epidemiology Cohort Studies Community Health Planning Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data Female Humans Incidence Italy/epidemiology Male Middle Aged Neoplasms/*epidemiology Registries/statistics & numerical data Retrospective Studies Risk Factors"

Findings from the few available studies are inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the dose-response relation between FV consumption and mortality, in terms of both time and rate, in a large prospective cohort of Swedish men and women. DESIGN: FV consumption was assessed through a self-administrated questionnaire in a population-based cohort of 71,706 participants (38,221 men and 33,485 women) aged 45-83 y. We performed a dose-response analysis to evaluate 10th survival percentile differences (PDs) by using Laplace regression and estimated HRs by using Cox regression. RESULTS: During 13 y of follow-up, 11,439 deaths (6803 men and 4636 women) occurred in the cohort. In comparison with 5 servings FV/d, a lower consumption was progressively associated with shorter survival and higher mortality rates. Those who never consumed FV lived 3 y shorter (PD: -37 mo; 95% CI: -58, -16 mo) and had a 53% higher mortality rate (HR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.99) than did those who consumed 5 servings FV/d. Consideration of fruit and vegetables separately showed that those who never consumed fruit lived 19 mo shorter (PD: -19 mo; 95% CI: -29, -10 mo) than did those who ate 1 fruit/d. Participants who consumed 3 vegetables/d lived 32 mo longer than did those who never consumed vegetables (PD: 32 mo; 96% CI: 13, 51 mo). CONCLUSION: FV consumption <5 servings/d is associated with progressively shorter survival and higher mortality rates.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of trials in women with intact membranes.,BJOG,Wood S and Cooper S and Ross S,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Recent literature on the effect of induction of labour (compared with expectant management) has provided conflicting results. Reviews of observational studies generally report an increase in the rate of caesarean section, whereas reviews of post-dates and term prelabour rupture of membrane (PROM trials suggest either no difference or a reduction in risk. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate with a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) whether or not the induction of labour increases the risk of caesarean section in women with intact membranes. SEARCH STRATEGY: Literature search using electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Clinical Trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs comparing a policy of induction of labour with expectant management in women with intact membranes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A total of 37 trials were identified and reviewed. Quantitative analyses with fixed- and random-effects models were performed with revman 5.1. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 37 RCTs, 27 were trials of uncomplicated pregnancies at 37-42 weeks of gestation. The remaining ten evaluated induction versus expectant management in pregnancies with suspected macrosomia (two), diabetes in pregnancy (one), oligohydramnios (one), twins (two), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) (two), mild pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) (one), and women with a high-risk score for caesarean section (one). Meta-analysis of 31 trials determined that a policy of induction was associated with a reduction in the risk of caesarean section compared with expectant management (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.92). AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS: Induction of labour in women with intact membranes reduces the risk of caesarean section. Review of the trials suggests that this effect may arise from non-treatment effects, and that additional trials are needed.","Cesarean Section/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data Decision Support Techniques Female Humans Labor, Induced/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data *Obstetric Labor, Premature Pregnancy Prognosis Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Risk Assessment"
23836632,Within-mother analysis of seasonal patterns in health at birth.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Currie J and Schwandt H,Missing,"A large literature describes relationships between month of birth, birth weight, and gestation. These relationships are hypothesized to reflect the causal impact of seasonal environmental factors. However, recent work casts doubt on this interpretation by showing that mothers with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to give birth in months that are associated with poorer birth outcomes. Seasonality in the numbers of conceptions in different months can also induce a mechanical correlation between preterm birth and month of birth. This paper analyzes the seasonality of health at birth using a large sample of 647,050 groups of US siblings representing 1,435,213 children. By following the same mother over time, we eliminate differences in fixed maternal characteristics as an explanation for seasonal differences in health at birth. We find a sharp trough in gestation length among babies conceived in May, which corresponds to an increase in prematurity of more than 10%. Birth weight conditional on gestation length, however, is found to be strongly hump-shaped over the year, with 8-9 additional g for summer conceptions. We examine several potential mechanisms for explaining seasonality in birth outcomes that have generally been dismissed in the literature on seasonality in rich countries, notably disease prevalence and nutrition. The May trough in gestation length coincides with a higher influenza prevalence in January and February, when these babies are nearing full term, whereas the hump shape in birth weight is associated with a similar pattern in pregnancy weight gain.",Demography Female Humans *Mothers Pregnancy *Seasons Siblings United States

OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between perinatal and infant exposures, especially early infant diet, and the development of T1DM. DESIGN: The Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) is a longitudinal, observational study. SETTING: Newborn screening for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) was done at St. Joseph's Hospital in Denver, Colorado. First-degree relatives of individuals with T1DM were recruited from the Denver metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1835 children at increased genetic risk for T1DM followed up from birth with complete prospective assessment of infant diet. Fifty-three children developed T1DM. EXPOSURES: Early (<4 months of age) and late (>/=6 months of age) first exposure to solid foods compared with first exposures at 4 to 5 months of age (referent). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Risk for T1DM diagnosed by a physician. RESULTS: Both early and late first exposure to any solid food predicted development of T1DM (hazard ratio [HR], 1.91; 95% CI, 1.04-3.51, and HR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.26-7.24, respectively), adjusting for the HLA-DR genotype, first-degree relative with T1DM, maternal education, and delivery type. Specifically, early exposure to fruit and late exposure to rice/oat predicted T1DM (HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.14-4.39, and HR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.36-6.11, respectively), while breastfeeding at the time of introduction to wheat/barley conferred protection (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.26-0.86). Complicated vaginal delivery was also a predictor of T1DM (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.03-3.61). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest the safest age to introduce solid foods in children at increased genetic risk for T1DM is between 4 and 5 months of age. Breastfeeding while introducing new foods may reduce T1DM risk.","Breast Feeding Child Child, Preschool Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*etiology/genetics *Diet Diet Surveys *Feeding Behavior Female Genetic Markers HLA-DQ beta-Chains/genetics HLA-DR3 Antigen/genetics HLA-DR4 Antigen/genetics Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Longitudinal Studies Male Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Risk Factors"
23836009,Major medical outcomes with spinal augmentation vs conservative therapy.,JAMA Intern Med,McCullough BJ and Comstock BA and Deyo RA and Kreuter W and Jarvik JG,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The symptomatic benefits of spinal augmentation (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are controversial. Recent population-based studies using medical billing claims have reported significant reductions in mortality with spinal augmentation compared with conservative therapy, but in nonrandomized settings such as these, there is the potential for selection bias to influence results. OBJECTIVE: To compare major medical outcomes following treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures with spinal augmentation or conservative therapy. Additionally, we evaluate the role of selection bias using preprocedure outcomes and propensity score analysis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort analysis of Medicare claims for the 2002-2006 period. We compared 30-day and 1-year outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed vertebral fractures treated with spinal augmentation (n = 10,541) or conservative therapy (control group, n = 115,851). Outcomes were compared using traditional multivariate analyses adjusted for patient demographics and comorbid conditions. We also used propensity score matching to select 9017 pairs from the initial groups to compare the same outcomes. EXPOSURES: Spinal augmentation (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) or conservative therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mortality, major complications, and health care utilization. RESULTS: Using traditional covariate adjustments, mortality was significantly lower in the augmented group than among controls (5.2% vs 6.7% at 1 year; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.92). However, patients in the augmented group who had not yet undergone augmentation (preprocedure subgroup) had lower rates of medical complications 30 days post fracture than did controls (6.5% vs 9.5%; odds ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.57-0.78), suggesting that the augmented group was less medically ill. After propensity score matching to better account for selection bias, 1-year mortality was not significantly different between the groups. Furthermore, 1-year major medical complications were also similar between the groups, and the augmented group had higher rates of health care utilization, including hospital and intensive care unit admissions and discharges to skilled nursing facilities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: After accounting for selection bias, spinal augmentation did not improve mortality or major medical outcomes and was associated with greater health care utilization than conservative therapy. Our results also highlight how analyses of claims-based data that do not adequately account for unrecognized confounding can arrive at misleading conclusions.","Aged, 80 and over Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies Female Humans Intensive Care Units/utilization Kaplan-Meier Estimate *Kyphoplasty Male Multivariate Analysis Osteoporotic Fractures/complications/mortality/*therapy Patient Admission/statistics & numerical data Propensity Score Retrospective Studies Skilled Nursing Facilities/utilization Spinal Fractures/complications/mortality/*therapy *Vertebroplasty"
23856401,"Infertility, infertility treatment, and achievement of pregnancy in female survivors of childhood cancer: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort.",Lancet Oncol,Barton SE and Najita JS and Ginsburg ES and Leisenring WM and Stovall M and Weathers RE and Sklar CA and Robison LL and Diller L,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown decreased pregnancy rates and early menopause in female cancer survivors; however, infertility rates and reproductive interventions have not been studied. We investigated infertility and time to pregnancy in female childhood cancer survivors, and analysed treatment characteristics associated with infertility and subsequent pregnancy. METHODS: The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a cohort study including 5 year cancer survivors from 26 Canadian and US institutions who were younger than 21 years at the time of diagnosis between Jan 1, 1970, and Dec 31, 1986, and a sibling control group. We included women aged 18-39 years who had ever been sexually active. We gathered demographic, medical, and reproductive data via a baseline questionnaire, and quantified exposure to alkylating agents and radiation therapy. Self-reported infertility, medical treatment for infertility, time to first pregnancy in survivors and siblings, and the risk of infertility in survivors by demographic, disease, and treatment variables were analysed. FINDINGS: 3531 survivors and 1366 female sibling controls who enrolled between Nov 3, 1992, and April 4, 2004, were included. Compared with their siblings, survivors had an increased risk (relative risk [RR] 1.48 [95% CI 1.23-1.78]; p<0.0001) of clinical infertility (ie, >1 year of attempts at conception without success), which was most pronounced at early reproductive ages (RR 2.92 [95% CI 1.18-7.20], p=0.020, in participants </=24 years; 1.61 [1.05-2.48], p=0.029, in those aged 25-29 years; and 1.37 [1.11-1.69], p=0.0035, in those aged 30-40 years). Despite being equally likely to seek treatment for infertility, survivors were less likely than were their siblings to be prescribed drugs for treatment of infertility (0.57 [95% CI 0.46-0.70], p<0.0001). Increasing doses of uterine radiation and alkylating agent chemotherapy were strongly associated with infertility. Although survivors had an increased time to pregnancy compared with their siblings (p=0.032), 292 (64%) of 455 participants with self-reported clinical infertility achieved a pregnancy. INTERPRETATION: A more comprehensive understanding of infertility after cancer is crucial for counselling and decision making about future conception attempts and fertility preservation.

23856984,Anatomic subsite of primary colorectal cancer and subsequent risk and distribution of second cancers.,Cancer,Phipps AI and Chan AT and Ogino S,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Individuals with a history of colorectal cancer (CRC) have an increased risk of subsequent cancer. In this study, the authors used cancer registry data to evaluate whether this increased risk of cancer after CRC differed by anatomic subsite of a first CRC. METHODS: Individuals diagnosed with a first primary CRC between 1992 and 2009 were identified from 12 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registries. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by comparing the incidence of subsequent cancers in these patients who had an index CRC versus the cancer incidence rates in the general population. SIRs were calculated for cancers at anatomic sites within and outside the colorectum in analyses stratified by subsite of the index CRC. RESULTS: Cancer incidence rates were significantly higher in individuals who had a previous CRC than in the general population (SIR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.13-1.16). Individuals with an index CRC located between the transverse and descending colon experienced the greatest increased risk both overall (SIR, 1.29-1.33) and particularly with respect to the risk of a second CRC (SIR, 2.53-3.35). The incidence of small intestinal cancer was elevated significantly regardless of the index CRC subsite (SIR, 4.31; 95% CI, 3.70-4.77), and the incidence of endometrial cancer was elevated in those who had an index CRC in the proximal colon (SIR, 1.37-1.79). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of second cancer after CRC differs by anatomic site of the first tumor and is particularly pronounced for those with prior CRC located in the transverse to descending colon. The mechanisms underlying this pattern of second cancer risk remain unknown.","Adult Aged Colorectal Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*pathology Female Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/*pathology Risk Assessment Risk Factors SEER Program United States/epidemiology"

This panel has generated the most extensive cancer pharmacology database worldwide. In addition, these cell lines have been intensely investigated, providing a unique platform for hypothesis-driven research focused on enhancing our understanding of tumor biology. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of coding variants in the NCI-60 panel of cell lines identified by whole exome sequencing, providing a list of possible cancer specific variants for the community. Furthermore, we identify pharmacogenomic correlations between specific variants in genes such as TP53, BRAF, ERBBs, and ATAD5 and anticancer agents such as nutlin, vemurafenib, erlotinib, and bleomycin showing one of many ways the data could be used to validate and generate novel hypotheses for further investigation. As new cancer genes are identified through large-scale sequencing studies, the data presented here for the NCI-60 will be an invaluable resource for identifying cell lines with mutations in such genes for hypothesis-driven research. To enhance the utility of the data for the greater research community, the genomic variants are freely available in different formats and from multiple sources including the CellMiner and Ingenuity websites.","Antineoplastic Agents Cell Line, Tumor Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods *Exome Genetic Variation Humans Mutation Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics Pharmacogenetics/methods"
23856682,Effect of electronic health records on health care costs: longitudinal comparative evidence from community practices.,Ann Intern Med,Adler-Milstein J and Salzberg C and Franz C and Orav EJ and Newhouse JP and Bates DW,umich,"BACKGROUND: The United States is aiming to achieve nationwide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) but lacks robust empirical evidence to anticipate the effect on health care costs. OBJECTIVE: To assess short-term cost savings from community-wide adoption of ambulatory EHRs. DESIGN: Longitudinal trial with parallel control group. SETTING: Natural experiment in which 806 ambulatory clinicians across 3 Massachusetts communities adopted subsidized EHRs. Six matched control communities applied but were not selected to participate. PATIENTS: 47,979 intervention patients and 130,603 control patients. MEASUREMENTS: Monthly standardized health care costs from commercial claims data from January 2005 to June 2009, including total cost, inpatient cost, and ambulatory cost and its subtypes (pharmacy, laboratory, and radiology). Projected savings per member per month (PMPM), excluding EHR adoption costs. RESULTS: Ambulatory EHR adoption did not impact total cost (pre- to postimplementation difference in monthly trend change, -0.30 percentage point; P = 0.135), but the results favored savings (95% CI, $21.95 PMPM in savings to $1.53 PMPM in higher costs). It slowed ambulatory cost growth (difference in monthly trend change, -0.35 percentage point; P = 0.012); projected ambulatory savings were $4.69 PMPM (CI, $8.45 to $1.09 PMPM) (3.10% of total PMPM cost). Ambulatory radiology costs decreased (difference in monthly trend change, -1.61 percentage points; P < 0.001), with projected savings of $1.61 PMPM (1.07% of total PMPM cost). LIMITATIONS: Intervention communities were not randomly selected and received implementation support, suggesting that results may represent a best-case scenario. Confounding is possible. CONCLUSION: Using commercially available EHRs in community practices seems to modestly slow ambulatory cost growth. Broader changes in the organization and payment of care may prompt clinicians to use EHRs in ways that result in more substantial savings.","Community Health Services/economics/*organization & administration Cost Savings Efficiency, Organizational Electronic Health Records/*economics *Health Care Costs Humans Massachusetts Matched-Pair Analysis Pilot Projects"
23837174,Parental knowledge of potential cancer risks from exposure to computed tomography.,Pediatrics,Boutis K and Cogollo W and Fischer J and Freedman SB and Ben David G and Thomas KE,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: Computed tomography (CT) imaging of children is increasing in emergent settings without an understanding of parental knowledge of potential cancer risks. In children with head injuries, our primary objective was to determine the proportion of parents who were aware of the potential of CT to increase a child's lifetime risk of malignancy. We also examined willingness to proceed with recommended CT after risk disclosure and preference to be informed of potential risks. METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional survey of parents whose children presented to a tertiary care pediatric emergency department with a head injury. Survey questions were derived and validated by using expert opinion, available literature, and pre- and pilot testing of questions with the target audience. RESULTS: Of the 742 enrolled parents, 454 (61.2%) were female and 594 (80.0%) were aged 31 to 50 years. Importantly, 357 (46.8%) were aware of the potential for an increased lifetime malignancy risk from CT. Before risk estimate provision, the proportion of parents ""very willing/willing"" to proceed with head CT was 90.4%; after disclosure, willingness decreased to 69.6% (P < .0001), and 42 (5.6%) would refuse the CT. Of note, 673 (90.3%) wished to be informed of potential malignancy risks. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of the participating parents were aware of the potential increased lifetime malignancy risk associated with head CT imaging. Willingness to proceed with CT testing was reduced after risk disclosure but was a significant barrier for a small minority of parents. Most parents wanted to be informed of potential malignancy risks before proceeding with imaging.","Awareness Craniocerebral Trauma/*radiography Cross-Sectional Studies Data Collection Emergency Service, Hospital *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Health Promotion Health Surveys Humans Infant Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology *Parental Consent Parents/*education Prospective Studies Risk Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*adverse effects"

The coupling of REIMS technology with electrosurgery for tissue diagnostics is known as the intelligent knife (iKnife). This study aimed to validate the technique by applying it to the analysis of fresh human tissue samples ex vivo and to demonstrate the translation to real-time use in vivo in a surgical environment. A variety of tissue samples from 302 patients were analyzed in the laboratory, resulting in 1624 cancerous and 1309 noncancerous database entries. The technology was then transferred to the operating theater, where the device was coupled to existing electrosurgical equipment to collect data during a total of 81 resections. Mass spectrometric data were analyzed using multivariate statistical methods, including principal components analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and a spectral identification algorithm using a similar approach was implemented. The REIMS approach differentiated accurately between distinct histological and histopathological tissue types, with malignant tissues yielding chemical characteristics specific to their histopathological subtypes. Tissue identification via intraoperative REIMS matched the postoperative histological diagnosis in 100% (all 81) of the cases studied. The mass spectra reflected lipidomic profiles that varied between distinct histological tumor types and also between primary and metastatic tumors. Thus, in addition to real-time diagnostic information, the spectra provided additional information on divergent tumor biochemistry that may have mechanistic importance in cancer.",Discriminant Analysis Humans Intraoperative Care/instrumentation/*methods Mass Spectrometry/instrumentation/*methods Multivariate Analysis Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasms/metabolism/surgery *Organ Specificity Phospholipids/analysis/chemistry Principal Component Analysis Reproducibility of Results Volatilization
23813700,"Associations of Tai Chi, walking, and jogging with mortality in Chinese men.",Am J Epidemiol,Wang N and Zhang X and Xiang YB and Li H and Yang G and Gao J and Zheng W and Shu XO,vanderbilt,"Moderate-intensity exercise has attracted considerable attention because of its safety and many health benefits. Tai Chi, a form of mind-body exercise that originated in ancient China, has been gaining popularity. Practicing Tai Chi may improve overall health and well-being; however, to our knowledge, no study has evaluated its relationship with mortality. We assessed the associations of regular exercise and specifically participation in Tai Chi, walking, and jogging with total and cause-specific mortality among 61,477 Chinese men in the Shanghai Men's Health Study (2002-2009). Information on exercise habits was obtained at baseline using a validated physical activity questionnaire. Deaths were ascertained through biennial home visits and linkage with a vital statistics registry. During a mean follow-up of 5.48 years, 2,421 deaths were identified. After adjustment for potential confounders, men who exercised regularly had a hazard ratio for total mortality of 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.74, 0.87) compared with men who did not exercise. The corresponding hazard ratios were 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.72, 0.89) for practicing Tai Chi, 0.77 (95% confidence interval: 0.69, 0.86) for walking, and 0.73 (95% confidence interval: 0.59, 0.90) for jogging.

We prospectively compared PCa prevalence in CAU and ASI men from specific populations with low penetrance of prostate-specific antigen screening. METHODS: Prostate glands were prospectively obtained during autopsy from men who died from causes other than PCa in Moscow, Russia (CAU), and Tokyo, Japan (ASI). Prostates were removed en-block and analyzed in toto. We compared across the 2 populations PCa prevalence, number and Gleason score (GS) of tumour foci, pathological stage, spatial location, and tumor volume using chi(2), Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests, and multiple logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Three hundred twenty prostates were collected, 220 from CAU men and 100 from ASI mean. The mean age was 62.5 in CAU men and 68.5 years in ASI men (P < .001). PCa prevalences of 37.3% in CAU men and 35.0% in ASI men were observed (P = .70). Average tumor volume was 0.303cm(3). In men aged greater than 60 years, PCa was observed in more than 40% of prostates, reaching nearly 60% in men aged greater than 80 years. GS 7 or greater cancers accounted for 23.1% and 51.4% of all PCa in CAU and ASI men, respectively, (P = .003). When adjusted for age and prostate weight, ASI men still had a greater probability of having GS 7 or greater PCa (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: PCa is found on autopsy in a similar proportion of Russian and Japanese men. More than 50% of cancers in ASI and nearly 25% of cancers in CAU men have a GS of 7 or greater.

Music is a form of distraction that may alleviate some of the pain and distress experienced by children while undergoing medical procedures. OBJECTIVE: To compare music with standard care to manage pain and distress. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial conducted in a pediatric emergency department with appropriate sequence generation and adequate allocation concealment from January 1, 2009, to March 31, 2010. Individuals assessing the primary outcome were blind to treatment allocation. A total of 42 children aged 3 to 11 years undergoing intravenous placement were included. INTERVENTIONS: Music (recordings selected by a music therapist via ambient speakers) vs standard care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was behavioral distress assessed blinded using the Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised. The secondary outcomes included child-reported pain, heart rate, parent and health care provider satisfaction, ease of performing the procedure, and parental anxiety. RESULTS: With or without controlling for potential confounders, we found no significant difference in the change in behavioral distress from before the procedure to immediately after the procedure. When children who had no distress during the procedure were removed from the analysis, there was a significantly less increase in distress for the music group (standard care group = 2.2 vs music group = 1.1, P < .05). Pain scores among children in the standard care group increased by 2 points, while they remained the same in the music group (P = .04); the difference was considered clinically important. The pattern of parent satisfaction with the management of children's pain was different between groups, although not statistically significant (P = .07). Health care providers reported that it was easier to perform the procedure for children in the music group (76% very easy) vs the standard care group (38% very easy) (P = .03). Health care providers were more satisfied with the intravenous placement in the music group (86% very satisfied) compared with the standard care group (48%) (P = .02).

It is, however, unclear if exposure to prenatal PFOS and PFOA has a lasting influence on growth. We estimated the associations between the maternal plasma level of PFOS or PFOA and the children's body mass index, waist circumference, and risk of overweight at 7 years of age. A total of 1,400 women were randomly selected from the Danish National Birth Cohort among those who provided blood samples early in pregnancy and gave birth to liveborn singletons in 1996-2002. Weight and height information at 7 years was available for 811 children. Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used for analyses. Maternal PFOS and PFOA concentrations were overall inversely but nonsignificantly associated with the children's body mass index, waist circumference, and risk of overweight at 7 years of age. In conclusion, plasma levels of PFOS and PFOA in pregnant women did not seem to have any appreciable influence on their children's anthropometry at this point in childhood.","Alkanesulfonic Acids/*adverse effects/blood Anthropometry Body Mass Index Caprylates/*adverse effects/blood Child Denmark Female Fluorocarbons/*adverse effects/blood Humans Infant, Newborn Infant, Small for Gestational Age Linear Models Logistic Models Male Maternal Exposure/adverse effects Overweight/*etiology Pregnancy *Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects Sulfonic Acids/*adverse effects/blood Waist Circumference"

Using January 1993-January 2010 data from the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study, we tested those hypotheses among 12,734 infants with malformations (cases) and 7,606 nonmalformed control infants in the United States and Canada. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for specific birth defects, with controlling for potential confounders. Findings did not replicate several hypotheses but did support 3 previously reported associations: phenylephrine and endocardial cushion defect (odds ratio = 8.0; 95% confidence interval: 2.5, 25.3; 4 exposed cases), phenylpropanolamine and ear defects (odds ratio = 7.8; 95% confidence interval: 2.2, 27.2; 4 exposed cases), and phenylpropanolamine and pyloric stenosis (odds ratio = 3.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 8.8; 6 exposed cases).

Accumulating evidence supports associations between first-trimester use of specific oral and possibly intranasal decongestants and the risk of some infrequent specific birth defects.","*Abnormalities, Drug-Induced Administration, Intranasal Administration, Oral Adult Canada Case-Control Studies Female Humans Infant, Newborn Logistic Models Nasal Decongestants/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Nonprescription Drugs/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Odds Ratio Pregnancy Pregnancy Trimester, First Self Report United States"
23865818,Exposure to antiepileptic drugs in utero and child development: a prospective population-based study.,Epilepsia,Veiby G and Daltveit AK and Schjolberg S and Stoltenberg C and Oyen AS and Vollset SE and Engelsen BA and Gilhus NE,Missing,"PURPOSE: Antiepileptic drugs may cause congenital malformations. Less is known about the effect on development in infancy and childhood. The aim of this study was to examine whether exposure to antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy has an effect on early child development. METHODS: From mid-1999 through December 2008, children of mothers recruited at 13-17 weeks of pregnancy were studied in the ongoing prospective Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Information on birth outcomes were obtained from the Medical Birth Registry (108,264 children), and mothers reported on their child's motor development, language, social skills, and autistic traits using items from standardized screening tools at 18 months (61,351 children) and 36 months (44,147 children) of age. The relative risk of adverse outcomes in children according to maternal or paternal epilepsy with and without prenatal exposure to antiepileptic drugs was estimated as odds ratios (ORs), using logistic regression with adjustment for maternal age, parity, education, smoking, depression/anxiety, folate supplementation, and child congenital malformation or low birth weight. KEY FINDINGS: A total of 333 children were exposed to antiepileptic drugs in utero. At 18 months, the exposed children had increased risk of abnormal scores for gross motor skills (7.1% vs. 2.9%; OR 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-3.7) and autistic traits (3.5% vs. 0.9%; OR 2.7, CI 1.1-6.7) compared to children of parents without epilepsy. At 36 months, the exposed children had increased risk of abnormal score for gross motor skills (7.5% vs. 3.3%; OR 2.2, CI 1.1-4.2), sentence skills (11.2% vs. 4.8%; OR 2.1, CI 1.2-3.6), and autistic traits (6.0% vs. 1.5%; OR 3.4, CI 1.6-7.0). The drug-exposed children also had increased risk of congenital malformations (6.1% vs. 2.9%; OR 2.1, CI 1.4-3.4), but exclusion of congenital malformations did not affect the risk of adverse development. Children born to women with epilepsy who did not use antiepileptic drugs had no increased risks. Children of fathers with epilepsy generally scored within the normal range. SIGNIFICANCE: Exposure to antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy is associated with adverse development at 18 and 36 months of age, measured as low scores within key developmental domains rated by mothers. Exposures to valproate, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, or multiple antiepileptic drugs were associated with adverse outcome within different developmental domains.","Anticonvulsants/*adverse effects Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Community Health Planning Developmental Disabilities/*chemically induced/*epidemiology Epilepsy/drug therapy Female Humans Infant Male Odds Ratio Parent-Child Relations Pregnancy Pregnancy Outcome/epidemiology Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*chemically induced/*epidemiology Questionnaires Registries/statistics & numerical data Reproducibility of Results Retrospective Studies Self Report Sensitivity and Specificity"

Based on pilot data, a phase III trial was developed to evaluate the efficacy of American ginseng on CRF. METHODS: A multisite, double-blind trial randomized fatigued cancer survivors to 2000mg of American ginseng vs a placebo for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the general subscale of the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) at 4 weeks. Changes from baseline at 4 and 8 weeks were evaluated between arms by a two-sided, two-sample t test. Toxicities were evaluated by self-report and the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) provider grading. RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-four participants were enrolled from 40 institutions. Changes from baseline in the general subscale of the MFSI-SF were 14.4 (standard deviation [SD] = 27.1) in the ginseng arm vs 8.2 (SD = 24.8) in the placebo arm at 4 weeks (P = .07). A statistically significant difference was seen at 8 weeks with a change score of 20 (SD = 27) for the ginseng group and 10.3 (SD = 26.1) for the placebo group (P = .003). Greater benefit was reported in patients receiving active cancer treatment vs those who had completed treatment. Toxicities per self-report and CTCAE grading did not differ statistically significantly between arms. CONCLUSIONS: Data support the benefit of American ginseng, 2000mg daily, on CRF over an 8-week period. There were no discernible toxicities associated with the treatment.

METHOD: UK data for 18 brain disorders were extracted from a systematic review of European epidemiological data and prevalence rates and the costs of each disorder were summarized (2010 values). RESULTS: There were approximately 45 million cases of brain disorders in the UK, with a cost of euro134 billion per annum. The most prevalent were headache, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, mood disorders and somatoform disorders. However, the five most costly disorders (euro million) were: dementia: euro22,164; psychotic disorders: euro16,717; mood disorders: euro19,238; addiction: euro11,719; anxiety disorders: euro11,687. Apart from psychosis, these five disorders ranked amongst those with the lowest direct medical expenditure per subject (<euro3000). The approximate breakdown of costs was: 50% indirect costs, 25% direct non-medical and 25% direct healthcare costs. DISCUSSION: The prevalence and cost of UK brain disorders is likely to increase given the ageing population. Translational neurosciences research has the potential to develop more effective treatments but is underfunded. Addressing the clinical and economic challenges posed by brain disorders requires a coordinated effort at an EU and national level to transform the current scientific, healthcare and educational agenda.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Brain Brain Diseases/*economics/*epidemiology Child Child, Preschool Cost of Illness Delivery of Health Care/economics Great Britain/epidemiology Health Care Costs Humans Mental Disorders/*economics/*epidemiology Middle Aged Prevalence Young Adult"

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all cesarean deliveries that occurred at 1 institution from 2004-2008. Four comparison groups were defined by BMI of <30 kg/m(2) (n = 668 women), 30-39.9 kg/m(2) (n = 1002 women), 40-49.9 kg/m(2) (n = 403 women), or >/=50 kg/m(2) (n = 193 women). The primary outcome was time from skin incision to infant delivery. Secondary outcomes were a composite measure of neonatal morbidity and its individual components: 5-minute Apgar score <7, umbilical cord arterial pH <7.10 and <7.20, umbilical cord arterial base excess </=8 mmol/L, special care nursery admission, and neonatal intensive care unit admission. RESULTS: Increasing BMI was associated with significantly increased time from skin incision to infant delivery, which demonstrated a dose-response pattern. Minutes from skin incision to delivery of the infant by BMI strata were 9.4 +/- 5.9 for <30 kg/m(2), 11.0 +/- 6.8 for 30-39.9 kg/m(2), 13.0 +/- 8.0 for 40-49.9 kg/m(2), and 16.0 +/- 11.3 for >/=50 kg/m(2) (P < .01). Composite neonatal morbidity was significantly higher with increasing BMI: 23.0% for <30 kg/m(2), 25% for 30-39.9 kg/m(2), 29.8% for 40-49.9 kg/m(2), and 32.1% for >/=50 kg/m(2) (P = .02). CONCLUSION: Increasing BMI is associated with a significantly increased time from skin incision to infant delivery and neonatal morbidity.

The present study compared the improvement in quality of life, lipid profile, blood pressure, weight, and physical performance after cardiac rehabilitation in patients <80 versus >/=80 years of age. A total of 1,112 patients, of whom 79 were older than 80 years, entered a 36-session outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program after interventions for coronary heart disease. The program consisted of physical exercise, lifestyle modification, and pharmacotherapy. Quality of life improved by 1.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6 to 2.0) in octogenarians and 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.1) in younger patients (p = 0.21), whereas weight decreased by 1.7 lbs (95% CI -2.9 to -0.4) and 3.1 lbs (95% CI -3.6 to -2.5, p = 0.04), respectively. In hypertensive patients, systolic blood pressure decreased from 155 +/- 11 to 133 +/- 20 mm Hg in octogenarians versus 155 +/- 13 to 130 +/- 20 mm Hg in younger patients, reducing the prevalence of hypertension to approximately 10% in both groups. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 16 mg/dl (95% CI -27 to -5) versus 19 mg/dl (95% CI -22 to -16), increasing the percentage of patients at recommended goals from 32% to 46% in the elderly (p = 0.04) and from 18% to 30% in younger patients (p <0.001). Metabolic equivalent levels increased by 1.0 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.3) in octogenarians versus 2.4 (95% CI 2.2 to 2.5) in younger patients (p <0.001).

METHODS: We searched ClinicalTrials.gov for cancer trials governed by the FDAAA: phase II to IV trials assessing drugs in the United States with a primary completion date between December 26, 2007, and May 31, 2010. For each trial, we also searched PubMed to identify the publication of results. We assessed the cumulative percentages of posted or published results over time by using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: We identified 646 trials, including 209 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). At 12 months after completion of the trials, the cumulative percentages of trials with results posted at ClinicalTrials.gov, published in journals, and available either at ClinicalTrials.gov or in journals were 9% (95% CI, 7% to 11%), 12% (95% CI, 10% to 15%), and 20% (95% CI, 17% to 23%), respectively, and for RCTs, the percentages were 12% (95% CI, 8% to 16%), 5% (95% CI, 2% to 8%), and 17% (95% CI, 12% to 22%), respectively. At 36 months, these percentages were 31% (95% CI, 28% to 35%), 35% (95% CI, 31% to 39%), and 55% (95% CI, 51% to 59%), respectively, and for RCTs, they were 38% (95% CI, 31% to 45%), 32% (95% CI, 25% to 39%), and 56% (95% CI, 48% to 62%), respectively.

However, few studies have explored potential confounding or effect modification of the association by other factors. METHODS: We examined the association between height measured at enrollment in 144,701 women participating in the Women's Health Initiative and risk of all cancers combined and cancer at 19 specific sites. Over a median follow-up of 12.0 years, 20,928 incident cancers were identified. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate HR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) per 10 cm increase in height, with adjustment for established risk factors. We also examined potential effect modification of the association with all cancer and specific cancers. RESULTS: Height was significantly positively associated with risk of all cancers (HR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.11-1.16), as well as with cancers of the thyroid, rectum, kidney, endometrium, colorectum, colon, ovary, and breast, and with multiple myeloma and melanoma (range of HRs: 1.13 for breast cancer to 1.29 for multiple myeloma and thyroid cancer). These associations were generally insensitive to adjustment for confounders, and there was little evidence of effect modification. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the positive association of height with risk of all cancers and a substantial number of cancer sites.

Epidemiologic evidence has focused largely on organophosphate exposures, while research on other pesticides is limited. We collected detailed pesticide use history from farmers recruited in 1998-2000 in France. Among 567 farmers aged 37-78 years, 83 (14.6%) self-reported treatment or hospitalization for depression. On the basis of the reported age at the first such instance, we used adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for depression (first treatment or hospitalization) by exposure to different pesticides. The hazard ratio for depression among those who used herbicides was 1.93 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95, 3.91); there was no association with insecticides or fungicides. Compared with nonusers, those who used herbicides for <19 years and >/=19 years (median for all herbicide users, 19 years) had hazard ratios of 1.51 (95% CI: 0.62, 3.67) and 2.31 (95% CI: 1.05, 5.10), respectively. Similar results were found for total hours of use. Results were stronger when adjusted for insecticides and fungicides. There is widespread use of herbicides by the general public, although likely at lower levels than in agriculture. Thus, determining whether similar associations are seen at lower levels of exposure should be explored.","Adult Aged Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*chemically induced *Agriculture Case-Control Studies Depression/*chemically induced Female France/epidemiology Fungicides, Industrial/toxicity Herbicides/toxicity Humans Insecticides/toxicity Male Middle Aged Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects Pesticides/*toxicity"
23831166,Estimates of current and future incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation in the U.S. adult population.,Am J Cardiol,Colilla S and Crow A and Petkun W and Singer DE and Simon T and Liu X,Missing,"Estimates and projections of diagnosed incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the United States have been highly inconsistent across published studies. Although it is generally acknowledged that AF incidence and prevalence are increasing due to growing numbers of older people in the U.S. population, estimates of the rate of expected growth have varied widely. Reasons for these variations include differences in study design, covered time period, birth cohort, and temporal effects, as well as improvements in AF diagnosis due to increased use of diagnostic tools and health care awareness. The objective of this study was to estimate and project the incidence and prevalence of diagnosed AF in the United States out to 2030. A large health insurance claims database for the years 2001 to 2008, representing a geographically diverse 5% of the U.S. population, was used in this study. The trend and growth rate in AF incidence and prevalence was projected by a dynamic age-period cohort simulation progression model that included all diagnosed AF cases in future prevalence projections regardless of follow-up treatment, as well as those cases expected to be chronic in nature. Results from the model showed that AF incidence will double, from 1.2 million cases in 2010 to 2.6 million cases in 2030. Given this increase in incidence, AF prevalence is projected to increase from 5.2 million in 2010 to 12.1 million cases in 2030. The effect of uncertainty in model parameters was explored in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Variability in future trends in AF incidence and recurrence rates has the greatest impact on the projected estimates of chronic AF prevalence. It can be concluded that both incidence and prevalence of AF are likely to rise from 2010 to 2030, but there exists a wide range of uncertainty around the magnitude of future trends.",Adult Atrial Fibrillation/*epidemiology Female *Forecasting Humans Incidence Male *Population Surveillance Prevalence Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Survival Rate/trends United States/epidemiology Young Adult

This work was intended to study the remission and persistence of childhood asthma and related factors. METHODS: In 1996, a questionnaire was distributed to the parents of all children aged 7 to 8 years in 3 municipalities in northern Sweden, and 3430 (97%) participated. After a validation study, 248 children were identified as having asthma; these children were reassessed annually until age 19 years when 205 (83%) remained. During the follow-up period lung function, bronchial challenge testing, and skin prick tests were performed. Remission was defined as no use of asthma medication and no wheeze during the past 12 months as reported at endpoint and in the 2 annual surveys preceding endpoint (ie, for >/= 3 years). RESULTS: At age 19 years, 21% were in remission, 38% had periodic asthma, and 41% persistent asthma. Remission was more common among boys. Sensitization to furred animals and a more severe asthma (asthma score >/= 2) at age 7 to 8 years were both inversely associated with remission, odds ratio 0.14 (95% confidence interval 0.04-0.55) and 0.19 (0.07-0.54), respectively. Among children with these 2 characteristics, 82% had persistent asthma during adolescence. Asthma heredity, damp housing, rural living, and smoking were not associated with remission. CONCLUSIONS: The probability of remission of childhood asthma from age 7- to 8-years to age 19 years was largely determined by sensitization status, particularly sensitization to animals, asthma severity, and female gender, factors all inversely related to remission.","Adolescent Age Factors Asthma/*diagnosis/*epidemiology Bronchial Provocation Tests Child Cross-Sectional Studies Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Intradermal Tests Longitudinal Studies Male Remission, Spontaneous Respiratory Function Tests Respiratory Hypersensitivity/diagnosis/epidemiology Risk Factors Sex Factors Sweden Young Adult"

Because early-stage lung cancer is associated with lower mortality than late-stage disease, early detection and treatment may be beneficial. PURPOSE: To update the 2004 review of screening for lung cancer for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, focusing on screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (2000 to 31 May 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through the fourth quarter of 2012), Scopus, and reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: English-language randomized, controlled trials or cohort studies that evaluated LDCT screening for lung cancer. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer extracted study data about participants, design, analysis, follow-up, and results, and a second reviewer checked extractions. Two reviewers rated study quality using established criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four trials reported results of LDCT screening among patients with smoking exposure. One large good-quality trial reported that screening was associated with significant reductions in lung cancer (20%) and all-cause (6.7%) mortality. Three small European trials showed no benefit of screening. Harms included radiation exposure, overdiagnosis, and a high rate of false-positive findings that typically were resolved with further imaging. Smoking cessation was not affected. Incidental findings were common. LIMITATIONS: Three trials were underpowered and of insufficient duration to evaluate screening effectiveness. Overdiagnosis, an important harm of screening, is of uncertain magnitude. No studies reported results in women or minority populations. CONCLUSION: Strong evidence shows that LDCT screening can reduce lung cancer and all-cause mortality. The harms associated with screening must be balanced with the benefits.

We need to better understand the factors affecting the health of kidney transplant recipients during this transition. OBJECTIVE: To determine the age at which renal transplant recipients are at greatest risk for graft loss. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 168,809 first kidney-only transplant events from October 1987 through October 2010, in recipients up to age 55 years as reported by the Organ Procurement Transplantation Network Standard Transplant Analysis and Research Database. Recipient age at transplant was the primary predictor studied. Confounder and effect modifier covariates were identified and studied using Cox proportional hazard models. EXPOSURE: Kidney-only transplant. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient and renal graft survival, along with death-censored and non-death-censored information. RESULTS: A total of 168,809 renal transplant events met the inclusion criteria. Recipients who received their first kidney transplant at age 14 to 16 years were at the highest risk of graft loss, with inferior outcomes starting at 1 and amplifying at 3, 5, and 10 years after transplant. Black adolescents were at disproportionately high risk of graft failure. The variables that had significant interaction with recipient age were donor type (deceased vs living) and insurance type (government vs private). Among 14-year-old recipients, the risk of death was 175% greater in the deceased donor-government insurance group vs the living donor-private insurance group (hazard ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.90-0.94] vs 0.34 [95% CI, 0.33-0.36]), whereas patient survival rates in the living donor-government insurance and deceased donor-private insurance groups were nearly identical (hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.58-0.63] vs 0.54 [95% CI, 0.51-0.56]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Recipients aged 14 to 16 years have the greatest risk of kidney allograft failure. Black adolescents and those with government insurance are at even higher risk. Private insurance reduces risk of death across all ages. Comprehensive programs are needed for adolescents, especially for those at greater risk, to reduce graft loss during the transition from adolescence to adulthood.","Adolescent Adult African Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Age Factors Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Female Graft Rejection/*epidemiology Graft Survival HLA Antigens/immunology Histocompatibility Testing Humans Hypertension/epidemiology Insurance, Health/statistics & numerical data Kaplan-Meier Estimate Kidney Transplantation/mortality/*statistics & numerical data Male Middle Aged Proportional Hazards Models Retrospective Studies Sex Factors Tissue Donors/statistics & numerical data United States/epidemiology"
23896998,The cost of assisted outpatient treatment: can it save states money?,Am J Psychiatry,Swanson JW and Van Dorn RA and Swartz MS and Robbins PC and Steadman HJ and McGuire TG and Monahan J,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: The authors assessed a state's net costs for assisted outpatient treatment, a controversial court-ordered program of community-based mental health services designed to improve outcomes for persons with serious mental illness and a history of repeated hospitalizations attributable to nonadherence with outpatient treatment. METHOD: A comprehensive cost analysis was conducted using 36 months of observational data for 634 assisted outpatient treatment participants and 255 voluntary recipients of intensive community-based treatment in New York City and in five counties elsewhere in New York State. Administrative, budgetary, and service claims data were used to calculate and summarize costs for program administration, legal and court services, mental health and other medical treatment, and criminal justice involvement. Adjusted effects of assisted outpatient treatment and voluntary intensive services on total service costs were examined using multivariate time-series regression analysis. RESULTS: In the New York City sample, net costs declined 43% in the first year after assisted outpatient treatment began and an additional 13% in the second year. In the five-county sample, costs declined 49% in the first year and an additional 27% in the second year. Psychotropic drug costs increased during the first year after initiation of assisted outpatient treatment, by 40% and 44% in the city and five-county samples, respectively. Regression analyses revealed significant declines in costs associated with both assisted outpatient treatment and voluntary participation in intensive services, although the cost declines associated with assisted outpatient treatment were about twice as large as those seen for voluntary services. CONCLUSIONS: Assisted outpatient treatment requires a substantial investment of state resources but can reduce overall service costs for persons with serious mental illness. For those who do not qualify for assisted outpatient treatment, voluntary participation in intensive community-based services may also reduce overall service costs over time, depending on characteristics of the target population and local service system.",Adult Ambulatory Care/*economics Community Mental Health Services/*economics/legislation & jurisprudence Drug Costs Female Health Care Costs/*legislation & jurisprudence Humans Male Mental Disorders/*economics New York New York City
23894436,The aetiological role of human papillomavirus in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a meta-analysis.,PLoS One,Liyanage SS and Rahman B and Ridda I and Newall AT and Tabrizi SN and Garland SM and Segelov E and Seale H and Crowe PJ and Moa A and Macintyre CR,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The aetiological role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has been widely researched for more than three decades, with conflicting findings. In the absence of a large, adequately powered single case-control study, a meta-analysis of all available case-control studies is the most rigorous way of identifying any potential association between HPV and OSCC. We present the first global meta-analysis of case-control studies investigating the role of HPV in OSCC. METHODS: Case-control studies investigating OSCC tissue for presence of HPV DNA were identified. 21 case-control studies analyzing a total of 1223 cases and 1415 controls, met our inclusion criteria. HPV detection rates were tabulated for each study and all studies were assessed for quality. The random effects method was used to pool the odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: From all OSCC specimens included in this meta-analysis, 35% (426/1223) were positive for HPV DNA. The pooled OR for an HPV-OSCC association was 3.04 (95% CI 2.20 to 4.20). Meta-regression analysis did not find a significant association between OR and any of the quality domains. Influence analysis was non-significant for the effect of individual studies on the pooled estimate. Studies conducted in countries with low to medium OSCC incidence showed a stronger relationship (OR 4.65, 95% CI 2.47 to 8.76) than regions of high OSCC incidence (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.91). CONCLUSIONS: Uncertainty around the aetiological role of HPV in OSCC is due largely to the small number and scale of appropriately designed studies. Our meta-analysis of these studies suggests that HPV increases the risk of OSCC three-fold. This study provides the strongest evidence to date of an HPV-OSCC association. The importance of these findings is that prophylactic vaccination could be of public health benefit in prevention of OSCC in countries with high OSCC incidence.","Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*etiology/*virology Case-Control Studies Esophageal Neoplasms/*etiology/*virology Humans Papillomaviridae/*pathogenicity Papillomavirus Infections/*complications/*virology"
23897915,"Video game use in boys with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, or typical development.",Pediatrics,Mazurek MO and Engelhardt CR,missouri,"OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to examine video game use in boys with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with those with ADHD or typical development (TD) and to examine how specific symptoms and game features relate to problematic video game use across groups. METHODS: Participants included parents of boys (aged 8-18) with ASD (n = 56), ADHD (n = 44), or TD (n = 41). Questionnaires assessed daily hours of video game use, in-room video game access, video game genres, problematic video game use, ASD symptoms, and ADHD symptoms. RESULTS: Boys with ASD spent more time than did boys with TD playing video games (2.1 vs 1.2 h/d). Both the ASD and ADHD groups had greater in-room video game access and greater problematic video game use than the TD group. Multivariate models showed that inattentive symptoms predicted problematic game use for both the ASD and ADHD groups; and preferences for role-playing games predicted problematic game use in the ASD group only. CONCLUSIONS: Boys with ASD spend much more time playing video games than do boys with TD, and boys with ASD and ADHD are at greater risk for problematic video game use than are boys with TD. Inattentive symptoms, in particular, were strongly associated with problematic video game use for both groups, and role-playing game preferences may be an additional risk factor for problematic video game use among children with ASD. These findings suggest a need for longitudinal research to better understand predictors and outcomes of video game use in children with ASD and ADHD.","Adolescent Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology Behavior, Addictive/epidemiology/psychology Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology Cross-Sectional Studies Data Collection Humans Life Style Male Missouri Questionnaires Reference Values Role Playing Time Factors Video Games/psychology/*statistics & numerical data"
23873919,Effectiveness of pertussis vaccines for adolescents and adults: case-control study.,BMJ,Baxter R and Bartlett J and Rowhani-Rahbar A and Fireman B and Klein NP,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of reduced acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines in adolescents and adults. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northern California. DESIGN: Case-control study. PARTICIPANTS: All polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed cases of pertussis in members aged 11 years and older from January 2006 to December 2011. We compared the Tdap vaccination status of PCR positive cases with two control groups: people testing negative for pertussis by PCR and closely matched people from the general Kaiser Permanente Northern California population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: PCR confirmed pertussis. The association of Tdap vaccination with the odds of pertussis infection was estimated by conditional logistic regression, with adjustment for calendar time, pertussis vaccine type received in early childhood, age, sex, race or ethnic group, and medical clinic. We calculated Tdap vaccine effectiveness as 1 minus the adjusted odds ratio. RESULTS: The study population included 668 PCR positive cases, 10,098 PCR negative controls, and 21,599 Kaiser Permanente Northern California matched controls. Tdap vaccination rates were 24.0% in PCR positive cases and 31.9% in PCR negative controls (P<0.001). The adjusted estimate of effectiveness of Tdap vaccination against pertussis was 53.0% (95% confidence interval 41.9% to 62.0%) in the comparison with PCR controls, and 64.0% (55.5% to 70.9%) in the comparison with Kaiser Permanente Northern California controls.

23849973,Effect of cardiorespiratory fitness on short-term morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting.,Am J Cardiol,Smith JL and Verrill TA and Boura JA and Sakwa MP and Shannon FL and Franklin BA,Missing,"Although preoperative risk assessment for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been evaluated with multiple predictive models, none have incorporated a low level of cardiorespiratory fitness, which represents one of the strongest predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in subjects with and without heart disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate preoperative cardiorespiratory fitness, expressed as METs (1 MET = 3.5 ml O2/kg/min), and short-term morbidity and mortality after CABG. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons database was queried for patients who underwent CABG from January 2002 to December 2010 at Beaumont Health Systems. Electronic medical records were reviewed for peak or symptom-limited exercise testing <90 days before CABG. Peak METs were estimated from the achieved treadmill speed, grade, and duration or the cycle ergometer workload, corrected for body weight. Patients who met eligibility criteria (n = 596) were categorized into 2 groups: those with reduced aerobic capacity (<5 METs [n = 78]) and those achieving >/=5 METs (n = 518). Fisher's exact tests were used to compare preoperative aerobic capacity and short-term postoperative morbidity and mortality between the 2 groups. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, an inverse relation was found between cardiorespiratory fitness and complications after CABG. Specifically, low preoperative cardiorespiratory fitness (<5 METs) was associated with higher operative and 30-day mortality after CABG (p <0.05). In conclusion, these data suggest that preoperative cardiorespiratory fitness provides an independent and additive marker for mortality after CABG.",Aged Cause of Death/trends *Coronary Artery Bypass Exercise Test Female Follow-Up Studies *Health Status Humans Male Michigan/epidemiology Middle Aged Morbidity/trends Myocardial Ischemia/mortality/*surgery Physical Fitness/*physiology Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology Preoperative Period Prognosis Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment/*methods Risk Factors Time Factors

The aim of this study was to describe the effect of smoking cessation in terms of prolonged life-years gained. The study sample comprised 856 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; balloon angioplasty) during 1980 to 1985. Patients were followed up for 30 years and smoking status at 1 year could be retrieved in 806 patients. The 27 patients who died within 1 year were excluded from the analysis. The median follow-up was 19.5 years (interquartile range 6.0 to 23.0). Cumulative 30-year survival rate was 29% in the group of patients who quit smoking and 14% in persistent smokers (p = 0.005). After adjustment for baseline characteristics at the time of PCI, smoking cessation remained an independent predictor of lesser mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.71). The estimated life expectancy was 18.5 years in those who quit smoking and 16.4 years in the persistent smokers (p <0.0001).

23894638,Epidemiology of noise-induced tinnitus and the attitudes and beliefs towards noise and hearing protection in adolescents.,PLoS One,Gilles A and Van Hal G and De Ridder D and Wouters K and Van de Heyning P,Missing,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous research showed an increase of noise-induced symptoms in adolescents. Permanent tinnitus as a consequence of loud music exposure is usually considered as noise-induced damage. The objective was to perform an epidemiological study in order to obtain prevalence data of permanent noise-induced tinnitus as well as temporary tinnitus following noise exposure in a young population. In addition the attitudes and beliefs towards noise and hearing protection were evaluated in order to explain the use/non-use of hearing protection in a young population. METHODS: A questionnaire was completed by 3892 high school students (mean age: 16.64 years old, SD: 1.29 years). The prevalence of temporary and permanent tinnitus was assessed. In addition the 'Youth Attitudes to Noise Scale' and the 'Beliefs About Hearing Protection and Hearing Loss' were used in order to assess the attitudes and beliefs towards noise and hearing protection respectively. RESULTS: The prevalence of temporary noise-induced tinnitus and permanent tinnitus in high school students was respectively 74.9% and 18.3%. An increasing prevalence of temporary tinnitus with age was present. Most students had a 'neutral attitude' towards loud music and the use of hearing protection was minimal (4.7%). The limited use of hearing protection is explained by a logistic regression analysis showing the relations between certain parameters and the use of hearing protection. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the very high prevalence of tinnitus in such a young population, the rate of hearing protection use and the knowledge about the risks of loud music is extremely low. Future preventive campaigns should focus more on tinnitus as a warning signal for noise-induced damage and emphasize that also temporary symptoms can result in permanent noise-induced damage.","Adolescent Attitude Female Hearing Loss, Noise-Induced/*epidemiology/prevention & control Humans Male Music Noise/*adverse effects Questionnaires Tinnitus/*epidemiology/prevention & control"
23816839,Ethnicity-specific birthweight distributions improve identification of term newborns at risk for short-term morbidity.,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Hanley GE and Janssen PA,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether ethnicity-specific birthweight distributions more accurately identify newborns at risk for short-term neonatal morbidity associated with small for gestational age (SGA) birth than population-based distributions not stratified on ethnicity. STUDY DESIGN: We examined 100,463 singleton term infants born to parents in Washington State between Jan. 1, 2006, and Dec. 31, 2008. Using multivariable logistic regression models, we compared the ability of an ethnicity-specific growth distribution and a population-based growth distribution to predict which infants were at increased risk for Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, ventilation, extended length of stay in hospital, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and infection. RESULTS: Newborns considered SGA by ethnicity-specific weight distributions had the highest rates of each of the adverse outcomes assessed-more than double those of infants only considered SGA by the population-based standards. When controlling for mother's age, parity, body mass index, education, gestational age, mode of delivery, and marital status, newborns considered SGA by ethnicity-specific birthweight distributions were between 2 and 7 times more likely to suffer from the adverse outcomes listed above than infants who were not SGA. In contrast, newborns considered SGA by population-based birthweight distributions alone were at no higher risk of any adverse outcome except hypothermia (adjusted odds ratio, 2.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.68-4.55) and neonatal intensive care unit admission (adjusted odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.67). CONCLUSION: Ethnicity-specific birthweight distributions were significantly better at identifying the infants at higher risk of short-term neonatal morbidity, suggesting that their use could save resources and unnecessary parental anxiety.","Adult Asia, Western/ethnology Asian Americans/*statistics & numerical data *Birth Weight China/ethnology European Continental Ancestry Group/*statistics & numerical data Female Humans Infant, Newborn Infant, Small for Gestational Age Male Pregnancy Risk Assessment Statistical Distributions Washington Young Adult"
23913583,Antioxidants for female subfertility.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Showell MG and Brown J and Clarke J and Hart RJ,Missing,"BACKGROUND: A couple may be considered to have fertility problems if they have been trying to conceive for over a year with no success. This difficulty with conception may affect up to a quarter of all couples planning a child. The reported prevalence of subfertility has increased significantly over the past twenty years. It is estimated that for 40% to 50% of couples, subfertility may be a result of female problems, including ovulatory disorders, poor egg quality, fallopian tube damage and endometriosis. Antioxidants are thought to reduce the oxidative stress brought on by these conditions. Currently, limited evidence suggests that antioxidants improve fertility, and trials have explored this area with varied results. This review assessed the evidence for the effectiveness of different antioxidants in female subfertility. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether supplementary oral antioxidants compared with placebo, no treatment/standard treatment or another antioxidant improve fertility outcomes for subfertile women. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases (from inception to April 2013) with no language restrictions applied: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS and OpenSIGLE. We also searched conference abstracts and citation lists in the ISI Web of Knowledge. Ongoing trials were searched in the Trials Registers. Reference lists were checked, and a search on Google was performed. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any type, dose or combination of oral antioxidant supplement with placebo, no treatment or treatment with another antioxidant, among women attending a reproductive clinic. Trials comparing antioxidants with fertility drugs alone and trials that exclusively included fertile women attending a fertility clinic because of male partner infertility were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently screened 2127 titles and abstracts, and 67 of these potentially eligible trials were appraised for inclusion and quality through review of full texts and contact with authors. Three review authors were involved in data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. Review authors also collected data on adverse events as reported from the trials. Studies were pooled using fixed-effect models; however, if high heterogeneity was found, a random-effects model was used. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the dichotomous outcomes of live birth, clinical pregnancy and adverse events. Analyses were stratified by type of antioxidant, by indications for subfertility and by those women also undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection techniques (ICSIs). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed by applying GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 28 trials involving 3548 women were included in this review. Investigators compared oral antioxidants, including combinations of antioxidants, pentoxifylline, N-acetyl-cysteine, melatonin, L-arginine, vitamin E, myo-inositol, vitamin C, vitamin D+calcium and omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids with placebo, with no treatment/standard treatment or another antioxidant.Antioxidants were not associated with an increased live birth rate compared with placebo or no treatment/standard treatment (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.26, P = 0.82, 2 RCTs, 97 women, I(2) = 75%, very low-quality evidence). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected live birth rate of 37%, the rate among women taking antioxidants would be between 10% and 83%.Antioxidants were not associated with an increased clinical pregnancy rate compared with placebo or no treatment/standard treatment (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.85, P = 0.14, 13 RCTs, 2441 women, I(2)= 55%, very low-quality evidence). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected clinical pregnancy rate of 23%, the rate among women taking antioxidants would be between 22% and 36%.Only one trial reported on live birth in the antioxidant versus antioxidant comparison, and two trials reported on clinical pregnancy in this comparison. Only subtotals were used in this analysis, and meta-analysis was not possible as each trial used a different antioxidant.Pentoxifylline was associated with an increased clinical pregnancy rate compared with placebo or no treatment (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.44, P = 0.009, 3 RCTs, 276 women, I(2) = 0%).Adverse events were reported by 14 trials in the meta-analysis and included miscarriage, multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy and gastrointestinal effects. No evidence revealed a difference in adverse effects between antioxidant groups and control groups, but these data were limited.The overall quality of evidence was 'very low' to 'low' because of poor reporting of outcomes, the number of small studies included, high risk of bias within studies and heterogeneity in the primary analysis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The quality of the evidence in the 'antioxidant versus placebo/no treatment' and in the 'antioxidant versus antioxidant' comparisons was assessed to be 'very low'. Antioxidants were not associated with an increased live birth rate or clinical pregnancy rate. There was some evidence of an association of pentoxifylline with an increased clinical pregnancy rate; however, there were only three trials included in this comparison. Future trials may change this result. Variation in the types of antioxidants given meant that we could not assess whether one antioxidant was better than another. There did not appear to be any association of antioxidants with adverse effects for women, but data for these outcomes were limited.","Administration, Oral Antioxidants/*administration & dosage Female Humans Infertility, Female/*drug therapy Live Birth/epidemiology Oxidative Stress Pregnancy Pregnancy Rate"
23918887,"Parent and child cigarette use: a longitudinal, multigenerational study.",Pediatrics,Vuolo M and Staff J,purdue,"OBJECTIVES: Using longitudinal data from the multigenerational Youth Development Study (YDS), this article documents how parents' long-term smoking trajectories are associated with adolescent children's likelihood of smoking. Prospective data from the parents (from age 14-38 years) enable unique comparisons of the parents' and children's smoking behavior, as well as that of siblings. METHODS: Smoking trajectories are constructed using latent class analysis for the original YDS cohort (n = 1010). Multigenerational longitudinal data from 214 parents and 314 offspring ages 11 years and older are then analyzed by using logistic regression with cluster-corrected SEs. RESULTS: Four latent smoking trajectories emerged among the original cohort: stable nonsmokers (54%), early-onset light smokers who quit/reduce (16%), late-onset persistent smokers (14%), and early-onset persistent heavy smokers (16%). Although 8% of children of stable nonsmokers smoked in the last year, the other groups' children had much higher percentages, ranging from 23% to 29%. Multivariate logistic regression models confirm that these significant differences were robust to the inclusion of myriad child- and parent-level measures (for which child age and grade point average [GPA] are significant predictors). Older sibling smoking, however, mediated the link between parental heavy smoking and child smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Even in an era of declining rates of teenage cigarette use in the United States, children of current and former smokers face an elevated risk of smoking. Prevention efforts to weaken intergenerational associations should consider parents' long-term cigarette use, as well as the smoking behavior of older siblings in the household.",Adolescent Adult Child Cross-Sectional Studies Female Humans *Imitative Behavior Logistic Models Longitudinal Studies Male Minnesota Parents/*psychology Risk Factors Siblings/*psychology Smoking/*epidemiology/*psychology Smoking Cessation/psychology/statistics & numerical data Young Adult

Stroke risk after AF ablation appears to be favorably affected; however, it is largely unknown whether the benefit extends to all stroke CHADS2 risk profiles of AF patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine if ablation of atrial fibrillation reduces stroke rates in all risk groups. METHODS: A total of 4212 consecutive patients who underwent AF ablation were compared (1:4) with 16,848 age-/sex-matched controls with AF (no ablation) and to 16,848 age-/sex-matched controls without AF. Patients were enrolled from the large ongoing prospective Intermountain Atrial Fibrillation Study and were followed for at least 3 years. RESULTS: Of the 37,908 patients, the mean age was 65.0 +/- 13 years and 4.4% (no AF), 6.3% (AF, no ablation), and 4.5% (AF ablation) patients had a prior stroke (P < .0001). The profile of CHADS2 scores between comparative groups was similar: 0-1 (69.3%, no AF; 62.3%, AF, no ablation; 63.6%, AF ablation), 2-3 (26.5%, no AF; 29.7%, AF, no ablation; 28.7%, AF ablation), and >/=4 (4.3%, no AF; 8.0%, AF, no ablation; 7.7%, AF ablation). A total of 1296 (3.4%) patients had a stroke over the follow-up period. Across all CHADS2 profiles and ages, AF patients with ablation had a lower long-term risk of stroke compared to patients without ablation. Furthermore, AF ablation patients had similar long-term risks of stroke across all CHADS2 profiles and ages compared to patients with no history of AF.

Whether this risk is affected by the results of follow-up intestinal biopsy, performed to document mucosal healing, is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between mucosal healing in CD and subsequent LPM. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: 28 pathology departments in Sweden. PATIENTS: 7625 patients with CD who had follow-up biopsy after initial diagnosis. MEASUREMENTS: The risk for LPM was compared with that of the general population by using expected rates. The rate of LPM in patients with persistent villous atrophy was compared with that of those with mucosal healing by using Cox regression. RESULTS: Among 7625 patients with CD and follow-up biopsy, 3308 (43%) had persistent villous atrophy. The overall risk for LPM was higher than that in the general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 2.81 [95% CI, 2.10 to 3.67]) and was greater among patients with persistent villous atrophy (SIR, 3.78 [CI, 2.71 to 5.12]) than among those with mucosal healing (SIR, 1.50 [CI, 0.77 to 2.62]). Persistent villous atrophy compared with mucosal healing was associated with an increased risk for LPM (hazard ratio [HR], 2.26 [CI, 1.18 to 4.34]). The risk for T-cell lymphoma was increased (HR, 3.51 [CI, 0.75 to 16.34]) but not for B-cell lymphoma (HR, 0.97 [CI, 0.21 to 4.49]). LIMITATION: No data on dietary adherence. CONCLUSION: Increased risk for LPM in CD is associated with the follow-up biopsy results, with a higher risk among patients with persistent villous atrophy.

23915495,Do girls with anorexia nervosa have elevated autistic traits?,Mol Autism,Baron-Cohen S and Jaffa T and Davies S and Auyeung B and Allison C and Wheelwright S,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Patients with anorexia may have elevated autistic traits. In this study, we tested test whether patients with anorexia nervosa (anorexia) have an elevated score on a dimensional measure of autistic traits, the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), as well as on trait measures relevant to the autism spectrum: the Empathy Quotient (EQ), and the Systemizing Quotient (SQ). METHODS: Two groups were tested: (1) female adolescents with anorexia: n = 66, aged 12 to 18 years; and (2) female adolescents without anorexia: n =1,609, aged 12 to 18 years. Both groups were tested using the AQ, EQ, and SQ, via the parent-report adolescent versions for patients aged 12 to 15 years old, and the self-report adult versions for patients aged over 16 years. RESULTS: As predicted, the patients with anorexia had a higher AQ and SQ. Their EQ score was reduced, but only for the parent-report version in the younger age group. Using EQ-SQ scores to calculate 'cognitive types', patients with anorexia were more likely to show the Type S profile (systemizing (S) better than empathy (E)), compared with typical females. CONCLUSIONS: Females with anorexia have elevated autistic traits. Clinicians should consider if a focus on autistic traits might be helpful in the assessment and treatment of anorexia. Future research needs to establish if these results reflect traits or states associated with anorexia.",Missing

DESIGN: Epidemiological investigations conducted after a family cluster of two patients with avian H7N9 in March 2013. SETTING: Wuxi, Eastern China. PARTICIPANTS: Two patients, their close contacts, and relevant environments. Samples from the patients and environments were collected and tested by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and haemagglutination inhibition assay. Any contacts who became ill had samples tested for avian H7N9 by rRT-PCR. Paired serum samples were obtained from contacts for serological testing by haemagglutination inhibition assays. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Clinical data, history of exposure before the onset of illnesses, and results of laboratory testing of pathogens and further analysis of sequences and phylogenetic tree to isolated strains. RESULTS: The index patient became ill five to six days after his last exposure to poultry. The second patient, his daughter aged 32, who provided unprotected bedside care in the hospital, had no known exposure to poultry. She developed symptoms six days after her last contact with her father. Two strains were isolated successfully from the two patients. Genome sequence and analyses of phylogenetic trees showed that both viruses were almost genetically identical. Forty three close contacts of both patients were identified. One had mild illness but had negative results for avian H7N9 by rRT-PCR. All 43 close contacts tested negative for haemagglutination inhibition antibodies specific for avian H7N9. CONCLUSIONS: The infection of the daughter probably resulted from contact with her father (the index patient) during unprotected exposure, suggesting that in this cluster the virus was able to transmit from person to person. The transmissibility was limited and non-sustainable.","Adult Animals Birds China/epidemiology Female Humans *Influenza A virus/classification/isolation & purification Influenza in Birds/epidemiology/*transmission/virology Influenza, Human/epidemiology/*transmission/virology Male Middle Aged Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"

We aimed to investigate the association between race and outcomes and to explore interactions with exercise training in patients with ambulatory HF. METHODS: We performed an analysis of HF-ACTION, which randomized 2331 patients with HF having an ejection fraction </=35% to usual care with or without exercise training. We examined characteristics and outcomes (mortality/hospitalization, mortality, and cardiovascular mortality/HF hospitalization) by race using adjusted Cox models and explored an interaction with exercise training. RESULTS: There were 749 self-identified black patients (33%). Blacks were younger with significantly more hypertension and diabetes, less ischemic etiology, and lower socioeconomic status versus whites. Blacks had shorter 6-minute walk distance and lower peak VO2 at baseline. Over a median follow-up of 2.5 years, black race was associated with increased risk for all outcomes except mortality. After multivariable adjustment, black race was associated with increased mortality/hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33) and cardiovascular mortality/HF hospitalization (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.20-1.77). The hazard associated with black race was largely caused by increased HF hospitalization (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.27-1.96), given similar cardiovascular mortality.

Although this A(H7N9) virus outbreak is now under control, the virus (or one with similar properties) could reemerge as winter approaches. To better assess the pandemic threat posed by A(H7N9) viruses, NIAID/NIH Centers of Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS) investigators and other expert laboratories in China and elsewhere have characterized the wild-type avian A(H7N9) viruses in terms of host range, virulence, and transmission, and are evaluating the effectiveness of antiviral drugs and vaccine candidates. However, to fully assess the potential risk associated with these novel viruses, there is a need for additional research including experiments that may be classified as ""gain-of-function"" (GOF).

We evaluated the relation between place of residence and risk of postpartum depression in a population-based sample of Canadian women. METHODS: Female postpartum respondents to the 2006 Canadian Maternity Experiences Survey (n=6126) were classified as living in rural (<1000 inhabitants or population density<400/km2), semirural (nonrural but <30,000 inhabitants), semiurban (30 000-499 999 inhabitants) or urban (>/=500,000 inhabitants) areas. We further subdivided women living in rural areas based on the social and occupational connectivity of their community to larger urban centres. We compared the prevalence of postpartum depression (score of >/=13 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) across these groups and adjusted for the effect of known risk factors for postpartum depression. RESULTS: The prevalence of postpartum depression was higher among women living in urban areas than among those living in rural, semirural or semiurban areas. The difference between semiurban and urban areas could not be fully explained by other measured risk factors for postpartum depression (adjusted odds ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.42-0.84). In rural areas, there was a nonsignificant gradient of risk: women with less connection to larger urban centres were at greater risk of postpartum depression than women in areas with greater connection. INTERPRETATION: There are systematic differences in the distribution of risk factors for postpartum depression across geographic areas, resulting in an increased risk of depression among women living in large urban areas. Prevention programs directed at modifiable risk factors (e.g., social support) could specifically target women living in these areas to reduce the rates of postpartum depression.","Adult Canada/epidemiology Cross-Sectional Studies Depression, Postpartum/*epidemiology Female Humans Multivariate Analysis Odds Ratio Risk Factors Rural Population/*statistics & numerical data Social Environment Social Support Urban Population/*statistics & numerical data"

OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the relationship between infant dietary patterns in the first year of life and development of food allergy by age 2 years. METHODS: We performed a nested, case-control, within-cohort study. Mothers kept prospective food diaries for the first year of life, with resultant diet data coded in a unique manner to produce new variables, which were then analyzed by using principal component analysis to identify infant feeding patterns within the study subjects. RESULTS: Principal component analysis of diet diary data from 41 infants given a diagnosis of food allergy based on results of double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges in the first 2 years of life and their 82 age-matched control subjects provided an early infant diet pattern and an ongoing diet pattern. There was no difference between the study groups for the early infant diet pattern, but for the ongoing diet pattern, there was a significant difference between the groups (P = .001). This ongoing dietary pattern was characterized by higher intake of fruits, vegetables, and home-prepared foods, with control infants having a significantly higher healthy infant diet dietary pattern score than children who had a food allergy. CONCLUSIONS: An infant diet consisting of high levels of fruits, vegetables, and home-prepared foods is associated with less food allergy by the age of 2 years.",Case-Control Studies *Diet Diet Records Female Food Hypersensitivity/diagnosis/*epidemiology Fruit Humans Infant Male Prospective Studies Vegetables

Knowledge on effective approaches for screening the underserved, including best test type to offer, is limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine (1) if organized mailed outreach boosts CRC screening compared with usual care and (2) if FIT is superior to colonoscopy outreach for CRC screening participation in an underserved population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We identified uninsured patients, not up to date with CRC screening, age 54 to 64 years, served by the John Peter Smith Health Network, Fort Worth and Tarrant County, Texas, a safety net health system. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 groups. One group was assigned to fecal immunochemical test (FIT) outreach, consisting of mailed invitation to use and return an enclosed no-cost FIT (n = 1593). A second was assigned to colonoscopy outreach, consisting of mailed invitation to schedule a no-cost colonoscopy (n = 479). The third group was assigned to usual care, consisting of opportunistic primary care visit-based screening (n = 3898). In addition, FIT and colonoscopy outreach groups received telephone follow-up to promote test completion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Screening participation in any CRC test within 1 year after randomization. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 59 years; 64% of patients were women. The sample was 41% white, 24% black, 29% Hispanic, and 7% other race/ethnicity. Screening participation was significantly higher for both FIT (40.7%) and colonoscopy outreach (24.6%) than for usual care (12.1%) (P < .001 for both comparisons with usual care). Screening was significantly higher for FIT than for colonoscopy outreach (P < .001). In stratified analyses, screening was higher for FIT and colonoscopy outreach than for usual care, and higher for FIT than for colonoscopy outreach among whites, blacks, and Hispanics (P < .005 for all comparisons). Rates of CRC identification and advanced adenoma detection were 0.4% and 0.8% for FIT outreach, 0.4% and 1.3% for colonoscopy outreach, and 0.2% and 0.4% for usual care, respectively (P < .05 for colonoscopy vs usual care advanced adenoma comparison; P > .05 for all other comparisons). Eleven of 60 patients with abnormal FIT results did not complete colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS AND REVELANCE: Among underserved patients whose CRC screening was not up to date, mailed outreach invitations resulted in markedly higher CRC screening compared with usual care. Outreach was more effective with FIT than with colonoscopy invitation.

23918889,Use of conventional and novel smokeless tobacco products among US adolescents.,Pediatrics,Agaku IT and Ayo-Yusuf OA and Vardavas CI and Alpert HR and Connolly GN,harvard,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence and correlates of use of conventional and novel smokeless tobacco products among a national sample of US middle and high school students. METHODS: Data from the 2011 National Youth Tobacco Survey were analyzed to determine national estimates of current use of conventional (""chewing tobacco"", ""snuff,"" or ""dip""), novel (""snus"" and ""dissolvable tobacco products""), and any smokeless tobacco products (novel and/or conventional products) within the past 30 days. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of current use of any smokeless tobacco product was 5.6% (n = 960). Among all students, 5.0% used chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip; 1.9% used snus; and 0.3% used dissolvable tobacco products. Among users of any smokeless tobacco, 64.0% used only conventional products, 26.8% were concurrent users of novel plus conventional products, whereas 9.2% exclusively used novel products. Approximately 72.1% of current any smokeless tobacco users concurrently smoked combustible tobacco products, and only 40.1% expressed an intention to quit all tobacco use. Regression analyses indicated that peer (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 9.56; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.14-12.80) and household (aOR: 3.32; 95% CI: 2.23-4.95) smokeless tobacco use were associated with smokeless tobacco use, whereas believing that all forms of tobacco are harmful was protective (aOR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.38-0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Conventional smokeless tobacco products remain the predominant form of smokeless tobacco use. Most users of novel smokeless tobacco products also concurrently smoked combustible tobacco products. Smokeless tobacco use was associated with lower perception of harm from all tobacco products and protobacco social influences, indicating the need to change youth perceptions about the use of all tobacco products and to engage pediatricians in tobacco use prevention and cessation interventions.","Adolescent Advertising as Topic Attitude to Health Child Cross-Sectional Studies Female Harm Reduction Health Surveys Humans Imitative Behavior Male Parents Peer Group Product Labeling Smoking/epidemiology Smoking Cessation/statistics & numerical data Social Facilitation Students/statistics & numerical data Tobacco Use Disorder/*epidemiology Tobacco, Smokeless/adverse effects/*utilization United States"

23871759,Military exposure and urinary incontinence among American men.,J Urol,Vaughan CP and Johnson TM 2nd and Goode PS and Redden DT and Burgio KL and Markland AD,emory,"PURPOSE: We examined the association between military exposure and urinary incontinence in American men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005 to 2008 were merged to include 5,297 men 20 years old or older. The question, ""Did you ever serve in the Armed Forces of the United States?"" (yes/no) was used to assess military exposure. Urinary incontinence was categorized as any or moderate/severe urinary incontinence vs none. Because the impact of military exposure varied by age, multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the OR and 95% CI stratified by 3 age groups, including 55 or less, 56 to 69 and 70 years or greater. Analysis was adjusted for race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, self-reported health status, number of chronic conditions, depression and prostate conditions, the latter in men 40 years old or older. RESULTS: Overall 23% of male respondents reported military exposure. Men with military exposure were more likely to report any urinary incontinence (18.6% vs 10.4%) and moderate/severe urinary incontinence (9.0% vs 3.1%, each p <0.001) than men without military exposure. After multivariate adjustment in men 55 years old or younger those with military exposure had 3 times greater odds of urinary incontinence (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.38-7.77). Military exposure did not increase the odds of urinary incontinence in men 56 to 69 years old (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.44-2.18), or 70 years old or older (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.55-1.50).

23933539,Cardiac arrest at exercise facilities: implications for placement of automated external defibrillators.,J Am Coll Cardiol,Page RL and Husain S and White LY and Rea TD and Fahrenbruch C and Yin L and Kudenchuk PJ and Cobb LA and Eisenberg MS,wisc,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to characterize the relative frequency, care, and survival of sudden cardiac arrest in traditional indoor exercise facilities, alternative indoor exercise sites, and other indoor sites. BACKGROUND: Little is known about the relative frequency of sudden cardiac arrest at traditional indoor exercise facilities versus other indoor locations where people engage in exercise or about the survival at these sites in comparison with other indoor locations. METHODS: We examined every public indoor sudden cardiac arrest in Seattle and King County from 1996 to 2008 and categorized each event as occurring at a traditional exercise center, an alternative exercise site, or a public indoor location not used for exercise. Arrests were further defined by the classification of the site, activity performed, demographics, characteristics of treatment, and survival. For some location types, annualized site incident rates of cardiac arrests were calculated. RESULTS: We analyzed 849 arrests, with 52 at traditional centers, 84 at alternative exercise sites, and 713 at sites not associated with exercise. The site incident rates of arrests at indoor tennis facilities, indoor ice arenas, and bowling alleys were higher than at traditional fitness centers. Survival to hospital discharge was greater at exercise sites (56% at traditional and 45% at alternative) than at other public indoor locations (34%; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a higher rate of cardiac arrests at some alternative exercise facilities than at traditional exercise sites. Survival was higher at exercise sites than at nonexercise indoor sites. These data have important implications for automated external defibrillator placement.","Adult Aged Death, Sudden, Cardiac/epidemiology/*prevention & control *Defibrillators *Exercise Female Humans Male Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/*epidemiology/mortality/*therapy Public Health Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment"
23924576,Increased asthma risk and asthma-related health care complications associated with childhood obesity.,Am J Epidemiol,Black MH and Zhou H and Takayanagi M and Jacobsen SJ and Koebnick C,Missing,"Asthma is the most common chronic condition of childhood, yet the relationship between obesity and asthma risk and the impact of obesity on clinical asthma outcomes are not well understood. For this population-based, longitudinal study, demographic and clinical data were extracted from administrative and electronic health records of 623,358 patients aged 6-19 years who were enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health plan in 2007-2011. Crude asthma incidence ranged from 16.9 per 1,000 person-years among normal-weight youth to 22.3 per 1,000 person-years among extremely obese youth. The adjusted risks of asthma for overweight, moderately obese, and extremely obese youth relative to those of normal weight youth were 1.16 (95% confidence interval: 1.13, 1.20), 1.23 (95% confidence interval: 1.19, 1.28), and 1.37 (95% confidence interval: 1.32, 1.42), respectively (Ptrend < 0.0001). The relationship between obesity and asthma risk was strongest in Asian/Pacific Islanders and in the youngest girls (aged 6-10 years), compared with other groups. Among youth who developed asthma, those who were moderately or extremely obese had more frequent asthma exacerbations requiring emergency department services and/or treatment with oral corticosteroids. In conclusion, obese youth are not only more likely to develop asthma, but they may be more likely to have severe asthma, resulting in a greater need for health care utilization and aggressive asthma treatment.",Adolescent Adrenal Cortex Hormones/administration & dosage Adult Anti-Asthmatic Agents/administration & dosage Asthma/drug therapy/*epidemiology Bronchodilator Agents/administration & dosage Child Female Humans Incidence Insurance Claim Review/statistics & numerical data Male Obesity/*epidemiology Overweight/epidemiology Risk Factors Severity of Illness Index Socioeconomic Factors

However, strategies that focus on school-day physical activity may not increase total physical activity if youth compensate by reducing physical activity outside of school. PURPOSE: Objectively measured, nationally representative physical activity data were used to test the hypothesis that higher school-day physical activity is associated with higher overall daily physical activity in youth. METHODS: Accelerometer data from 2003-2004/2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were analyzed in 2012 to estimate physical activity levels during the school day (8AM-3PM) among youth aged 6-19 years (n=2548). Fixed-effects regressions were used to estimate the impact of changes in school-day minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on changes in total daily MVPA. RESULTS: Each additional minute of school-day MVPA was associated with an additional 1.14 minutes (95% CI=1.04, 1.24; p<0.001) of total daily MVPA, or 0.14 additional minutes (95% CI=0.04, 0.24; p=0.008) outside the school day, controlling for total daily accelerometer wear time and age, gender, race/ethnicity, and other non-time varying covariates. There were no differences in the effect of school-day MVPA on total MVPA by age group, gender, race/ethnicity, poverty status, or degree of change in MVPA. CONCLUSIONS: Higher school-day MVPA was associated with higher daily MVPA among U.S. youth with no evidence for same-day ""compensation.""

DESIGN: Five waves of cross-sectional surveys. SETTING: Taiwan, 2004-11. PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative sample of junior high schools aged 13-15 years, in a biennial survey, total sample size 101,100. MEASURES: Core questionnaire of the Global Youth Tobacco Survey, including ever smoking, 30-day smoking and number of cigarettes smoked. The magnitude of prevalence change before and after the 2009 policy implementation was quantified by adjusted odds ratios estimated by piecewise logistic regression models. FINDINGS: The 30-day smoking prevalence demonstrated an upward trend [odds ratio (OR) = 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.10] between 2004 and 2008. Significant decline in 30-day smoking prevalence after the 2009 law implementation was observed (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.71-0.99). Those living in non-city areas demonstrated a greater magnitude of change. In addition to changes in prevalence, we observed some delay in the age starting smoking, reduction in smokers who smoke fewer than one cigarette per day, and decrease in smokers who did not buy cigarettes. The decline in smoking prevalence was contributed primarily by the reduction in experimenters. CONCLUSION: The comprehensive tobacco control programme introduced in Taiwan in 2009 was associated with a reduction in adolescent smoking, particularly among those in earlier stages of smoking and those who resided in non-city areas.",Adolescent Adolescent Behavior Advertising as Topic/legislation & jurisprudence Cross-Sectional Studies Female *Health Policy Humans Male Prevalence Questionnaires Risk Factors *Smoke-Free Policy Smoking/economics/*epidemiology/legislation & jurisprudence Taiwan/epidemiology Tobacco Smoke Pollution/legislation & jurisprudence

This observational study assesses gender variance in independent predictors for obesity to determine targeted areas for intervention. METHODS: Data from 1714 sixth-grade students enrolled in Project Healthy Schools were compared by using health behaviors and physiologic markers (lipids, random glucose, blood pressure, and resting and recovery heart rates). Students were stratified by gender and obesity (BMI >/=95th percentile by age and gender). Physiologic markers and behaviors were compared by using chi(2) analysis. Univariate associations with P < .10 were included in a stepwise logistic regression model to determine independent predictors for obesity by gender. RESULTS: Nonobese students (both boys and girls) showed significantly healthier physiologic parameters compared with their obese counterparts. Two behaviors independently correlated with obesity in both boys and girls: regularly eating school lunches (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.64; OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00-1.62, respectively) and watching >/=2 hours of television per day (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07-1.32; OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.34, respectively).

23940238,Home visiting and outcomes of preterm infants: a systematic review.,Pediatrics,Goyal NK and Teeters A and Ammerman RT,cchmc,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Home visiting is 1 strategy to improve child health and parenting. Since implementation of home visiting trials 2 decades ago, US preterm births (<37 weeks) have risen by 20%. The objective of this study was to review evidence regarding home visiting and outcomes of preterm infants METHODS: Searches of Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, PsycINFO, and Embase were conducted. Criteria for inclusion were (1) cohort or controlled trial designs; (2) home-based, preventive services for infants at medical or social risk; and (3) outcomes reported for infants born preterm or low birth weight (<2500 g). Data from eligible reports were abstracted by 2 reviewers. Random effects meta-analysis was used to synthesize data for developmental and parent interaction measures. RESULTS: Seventeen studies (15 controlled trials, 2 cohort studies) were reviewed. Five outcome domains were identified: infant development, parent-infant interaction, morbidity, abuse/neglect, and growth/nutrition. Six studies (n = 336) demonstrated a pooled standardized mean difference of 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.57 to 1.02) in Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Inventory scores at 1 year in the home-visited groups versus control. Evidence for other outcomes was limited. Methodological limitations were common. CONCLUSIONS: Reviewed studies suggest that home visiting for preterm infants promotes improved parent-infant interaction. Further study of interventions targeting preterm infants within existing programs may strengthen the impact and cost benefits of home visiting in at-risk populations.","Child Abuse/economics/prevention & control/statistics & numerical data Child Health Services/economics/utilization Child Nutrition Disorders/economics/prevention & control Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic Cost-Benefit Analysis Cross-Sectional Studies Developmental Disabilities/economics/prevention & control Education/economics/organization & administration Female Health Plan Implementation/economics/organization & administration *House Calls/economics Humans Infant *Infant, Low Birth Weight Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature, Diseases/economics/epidemiology/*therapy Male Parent-Child Relations Risk Factors Social Environment United States Utilization Review"

The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.","Aging/genetics Algorithms Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/pathology Cytidine Deaminase/genetics DNA/genetics/metabolism DNA Mutational Analysis Humans Models, Genetic Mutagenesis/*genetics Mutagenesis, Insertional/genetics Mutagens/pharmacology Mutation/*genetics Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics/pathology Organ Specificity Reproducibility of Results Sequence Deletion/genetics Transcription, Genetic/genetics"

No clinical trial has yet examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation in isolated systolic hypertension, the most common pattern of hypertension in older people. OBJECTIVE: To test whether high-dose, intermittent cholecalciferol supplementation lowers blood pressure in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension. DESIGN: Parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial. SETTING: Primary care clinics and hospital clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Patients 70 years and older with isolated systolic hypertension (supine systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg and supine diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) and baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL were randomized into the trial from June 1, 2009, through May 31, 2011.

No significant treatment effect was evident for any of the secondary outcomes (24-hour blood pressure, arterial stiffness, endothelial function, cholesterol level, glucose level, and walking distance). There was no excess of adverse events in the treatment group, and the total number of falls was nonsignificantly lower in the group receiving vitamin D (36 vs 46, P = .24). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vitamin D supplementation did not improve blood pressure or markers of vascular health in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension.

23945954,Cortical folding defects as markers of poor treatment response in first-episode psychosis.,JAMA Psychiatry,Palaniyappan L and Marques TR and Taylor H and Handley R and Mondelli V and Bonaccorso S and Giordano A and McQueen G and DiForti M and Simmons A and David AS and Pariante CM and Murray RM and Dazzan P,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: At present, no reliable predictors exist to distinguish future responders from nonresponders to treatment during the first episode of psychosis. Among potential neuroimaging predictors of treatment response, gyrification represents an important marker of the integrity of normal cortical development that may characterize, already at illness onset, a subgroup of patients with particularly poor outcome. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients with first-episode psychosis who do not respond to 12 weeks of antipsychotic treatment already have significant gyrification defects at illness onset. DESIGN: Case-control study with 12 weeks' longitudinal follow-up to determine treatment response. SETTING: Secondary psychiatric services in an inner-city area (South London, England). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 126 subjects, including 80 patients presenting with first-episode psychosis and 46 healthy controls. Patients were scanned at the outset and received various antipsychotic medications in a naturalistic clinical setting. They were followed up for 12 weeks and classified as responders or nonresponders if they reached criteria for symptom remission, evaluated with the Psychiatric and Personal History Schedule. OBSERVATION: Patients were exposed to naturalistic antipsychotic treatment for 12 weeks following a magnetic resonance imaging scan. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cortical gyrification was assessed using local gyrification index in a vertexwise fashion across the entire cortical surface with correction for multiple testing using permutation analysis. Differences in local gyrification index were assessed between responders, nonresponders, and healthy controls. The effect of diagnosis (affective vs nonaffective psychosis) on the local gyrification index was also investigated in responders and nonresponders. RESULTS: Patients with first-episode psychosis showed a significant reduction in gyrification (hypogyria) across multiple brain regions compared with healthy controls. Interestingly, nonresponders showed prominent hypogyria at bilateral insular, left frontal, and right temporal regions when compared with responders (all clusters significant at P < .05). These effects were present for both affective and nonaffective psychoses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Gyrification appears to be a useful predictor of antipsychotic treatment response. Early neurodevelopmental aberrations may predict unfavorable prognosis in psychosis, irrespective of the existing diagnostic boundaries.",Adult Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use Case-Control Studies Cerebral Cortex/*pathology Female Humans Male Neuroimaging Psychotic Disorders/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*pathology Treatment Failure

Based on pilot data, a phase III trial was developed to evaluate the efficacy of American ginseng on CRF. METHODS: A multisite, double-blind trial randomized fatigued cancer survivors to 2000mg of American ginseng vs a placebo for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the general subscale of the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) at 4 weeks. Changes from baseline at 4 and 8 weeks were evaluated between arms by a two-sided, two-sample t test. Toxicities were evaluated by self-report and the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) provider grading. RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-four participants were enrolled from 40 institutions. Changes from baseline in the general subscale of the MFSI-SF were 14.4 (standard deviation [SD] = 27.1) in the ginseng arm vs 8.2 (SD = 24.8) in the placebo arm at 4 weeks (P = .07). A statistically significant difference was seen at 8 weeks with a change score of 20 (SD = 27) for the ginseng group and 10.3 (SD = 26.1) for the placebo group (P = .003). Greater benefit was reported in patients receiving active cancer treatment vs those who had completed treatment. Toxicities per self-report and CTCAE grading did not differ statistically significantly between arms. CONCLUSIONS: Data support the benefit of American ginseng, 2000mg daily, on CRF over an 8-week period. There were no discernible toxicities associated with the treatment. Studies to increase knowledge to guide the role of ginseng to improve CRF are needed.",Adult Aged Double-Blind Method Fatigue/*drug therapy/*etiology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplasms/*complications *Panax Phytotherapy/*methods Plant Extracts/*therapeutic use Time Factors Treatment Outcome

OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of major medical comorbidity in patients with mild, moderate, or severe psoriasis, classified objectively based on body surface area involvement, compared with that in patients without psoriasis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cross-sectional study of patient data from United Kingdom-based electronic medical records; analysis included 9035 patients aged 25 to 64 years with psoriasis and 90,350 age- and practice-matched patients without psoriasis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of major medical comorbidity included in the Charlson comorbidity index. RESULTS: Among patients with psoriasis, 51.8%, 35.8%, and 12.4%, respectively, had mild, moderate, or severe disease based on body surface area criteria. The mean Charlson comorbidity index was increasingly higher in patients with mild (0.375 vs 0.347), moderate (0.398 vs 0.342), or severe psoriasis (0.450 vs 0.348) (each P < .05). Psoriasis overall was associated with higher prevalence of chronic pulmonary disease (adjusted odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.15), diabetes mellitus (1.22; 1.11-1.35), diabetes with systemic complications (1.34; 1.11-1.62), mild liver disease (1.41; 1.12-1.76), myocardial infarction (1.34; 1.07-1.69), peptic ulcer disease (1.27; 1.03-1.58), peripheral vascular disease (1.38; 1.07-1.77), renal disease (1.28; 1.11-1.48), and rheumatologic disease (2.04; 1.71-2.42). Trend analysis revealed significant associations between psoriasis severity and each of the above comorbid diseases (each P < .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The burdens of overall medical comorbidity and of specific comorbid diseases increase with increasing disease severity among patients with psoriasis.

An investment of approximately euro560 million is considered necessary to develop a new, effective vaccine in the European Union (EU). However, less is known about the costs of TB disease in the EU. We performed a systematic review of literature and institutional websites addressing the 27 EU members to summarise cost data. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane bibliographies for relevant articles. Combining direct and indirect costs, we arrived at an average per-TB case costs in the original EU-15 states plus Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia of euro10 282 for drug-susceptible TB, euro57 213 for multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB and euro170 744 for extensively drug resistant (XDR)-TB. In the remaining new EU states, costs amounted to euro3427 for drug-susceptible TB and euro24 166 for MDR-TB/XDR-TB. For the 70 340 susceptible TB cases, 1488 MDR-TB and 136 XDR-TB cases notified in 2011 costs of euro536 890 315 accumulated in 2012. In the same year, the 103 104 disability-adjusted life years caused by these cases, when stated in monetary terms, amounted to a total of euro5 361 408 000. Thus, the resulting economic burden of TB in the EU clearly outweighs the cost of investing in more efficient vaccines against TB.",Missing

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a population-based retrospective cohort design. Data were obtained from several Ontario health care administrative databases. Within a cohort of men older than age 66 years with incident diabetes who subsequently developed PC, we examined the effect of duration of antidiabetic medication exposure after PC diagnosis on all-cause and PC-specific mortality. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated by using a time-varying Cox proportional hazard model to estimate effects. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 3,837 patients. Median age at diagnosis of PC was 75 years (interquartile range [IQR], 72 to 79 years). During a median follow-up of 4.64 years (IQR, 2.7 to 7.1 years), 1,343 (35%) died, and 291 patients (7.6%) died as a result of PC. Cumulative duration of metformin treatment after PC diagnosis was associated with a significant decreased risk of PC-specific and all-cause mortality in a dose-dependent fashion. Adjusted HR for PC-specific mortality was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.89) for each additional 6 months of metformin use. The association with all-cause mortality was also significant but declined over time from an HR of 0.76 in the first 6 months to 0.93 between 24 and 30 months. There was no relationship between cumulative use of other antidiabetic drugs and either outcome. CONCLUSION: Increased cumulative duration of metformin exposure after PC diagnosis was associated with decreases in both all-cause and PC-specific mortality among diabetic men.",Aged Cause of Death Cohort Studies Diabetes Mellitus/*drug therapy Humans Hypoglycemic Agents/*therapeutic use Male Metformin/*therapeutic use Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*mortality Retrospective Studies

METHODS: Analysis of pooled observational cohort data, self-reported at enrollment and at follow-up from the International BRCA1, and BRCA2 Carrier Cohort Study, Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer, and Breast Cancer Family Registry. Eligible women were BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers diagnosed with unilateral BC since 1970 and no other invasive cancer or tamoxifen use before first BC. Hazard ratios (HRs) for CBC associated with tamoxifen use were estimated using Cox regression, adjusting for year and age of diagnosis, country, and bilateral oophorectomy and censoring at contralateral mastectomy, death, or loss to follow-up. RESULTS: Of 1,583 BRCA1 and 881 BRCA2 mutation carriers, 383 (24%) and 454 (52%), respectively, took tamoxifen after first BC diagnosis. There were 520 CBCs over 20,104 person-years of observation. The adjusted HR estimates were 0.38 (95% CI, 0.27 to 0.55) and 0.33 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.50) for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, respectively. After left truncating at recruitment to the cohort, adjusted HR estimates were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.29 to 1.13) and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.05) based on 657 BRCA1 and 426 BRCA2 mutation carriers with 100 CBCs over 4,392 person-years of prospective follow-up. HRs did not differ by estrogen receptor status of the first BC (missing for 56% of cases). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that tamoxifen use is associated with a reduction in CBC risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Further follow-up of these cohorts will provide increased statistical power for future prospective analyses.","Adult Aged Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*prevention & control Estrogen Antagonists/*therapeutic use Female *Genes, BRCA1 *Genes, BRCA2 *Heterozygote Humans Middle Aged *Mutation Proportional Hazards Models Risk Factors Tamoxifen/*therapeutic use"
23958770,Pediatrician identification of Latino children at risk for autism spectrum disorder.,Pediatrics,Zuckerman KE and Mattox K and Donelan K and Batbayar O and Baghaee A and Bethell C,ohsu,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Latino-white disparities in age at autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis may be modified by primary care pediatrician (PCP) practices and beliefs. The objectives of this study were to assess ASD and developmental screening practices, attitudes toward ASD identification in Latino children, and barriers to ASD identification for Latino children, in a sample of 267 California PCPs. METHODS: In mail-based PCP survey, we assessed rates of bilingual general developmental and ASD screening, perceptions of parent ASD knowledge in Latino and white families, reports of difficulty assessing for ASDs in Latino and white children, and perceptions of barriers to early ASD identification for Latinos. RESULTS: Although 81% of PCPs offered some form of developmental screening, 29% of PCPs offered Spanish ASD screening per American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, and only 10% offered both Spanish general developmental and Spanish ASD screening per American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. Most PCPs thought that Latino (English and Spanish primary family language) parents were less knowledgeable about ASDs than white parents. PCPs had more difficulty assessing ASD risk for Latino children with Spanish primary family language than for white children, even when the PCP conducted recommended ASD screening or had >25% Latino patients. The most frequent barrier to ASD identification in Latinos was access to developmental specialists. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors in the primary care setting may contribute to delayed ASD identification for Latinos. Promoting language-appropriate screening, disseminating culturally appropriate ASD materials to Latino families, improving the specialist workforce, and providing PCP support in screening and referral of Latino children may be important ways to reduce racial and ethnic differences in care.","Attitude of Health Personnel California Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/*diagnosis/*ethnology/psychology Communication Barriers Culture Developmental Disabilities/diagnosis/ethnology/psychology Early Diagnosis European Continental Ancestry Group/*psychology Guideline Adherence Health Literacy Health Services Accessibility Health Surveys Healthcare Disparities Hispanic Americans/*psychology Humans Mass Screening Multilingualism *Pediatrics Primary Health Care Risk Factors"

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a multifaceted evaluation of transitional care from a patient-centered perspective. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study, May 2009 through April 2010. SETTING: Urban, academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Patients 65 years and older discharged home after hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, or pneumonia. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Discharge practices, including presence of follow-up appointment and patient-friendly discharge instructions; patient understanding of diagnosis and follow-up appointment; and patient perceptions of and satisfaction with discharge care. RESULTS: The 395 enrolled patients (66.7% of those eligible) had a mean age of 77.2 years. Although 349 patients (95.6%) reported understanding the reason they had been in the hospital, only 218 patients (59.6%) were able to accurately describe their diagnosis in postdischarge interviews. Discharge instructions routinely included symptoms to watch out for (98.4%), activity instructions (97.3%), and diet advice (89.7%) in lay language; however, 99 written reasons for hospitalization (26.3%) did not use language likely to be intelligible to patients. Of the 123 patients (32.6%) discharged with a scheduled primary care or cardiology appointment, 54 (43.9%) accurately recalled details of either appointment. During postdischarge interviews, 118 patients (30.0%) reported receiving less than 1 day's advance notice of discharge, and 246 (66.1%) reported that staff asked whether they would have the support they needed at home before discharge. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patient perceptions of discharge care quality and self-rated understanding were high, and written discharge instructions were generally comprehensive although not consistently clear. However, follow-up appointments and advance discharge planning were deficient, and patient understanding of key aspects of postdischarge care was poor.

23959427,Recurrence of autism spectrum disorders in full- and half-siblings and trends over time: a population-based cohort study.,JAMA Pediatr,Gronborg TK and Schendel DE and Parner ET,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: To date, this is the first population-based study to examine the recurrence risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), including time trends, and the first study to consider the ASDs recurrence risk for full- and half-siblings. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the relative recurrence risk for ASDs in a Danish population, including recurrence in full- and half-siblings, and to examine time trends in ASDs relative to the recurrence risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study in Denmark. All children (about 1.5 million) born in Denmark between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2004, were identified and followed up to December 31, 2010. We identified a maternal sibling subcohort derived from mothers with at least 2 children and a paternal sibling subcohort derived from fathers with at least 2 children. EXPOSURES: Children having an older sibling with ASDs are compared with children not having an older sibling with ASDs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The adjusted hazard ratio for ASDs among children having an older sibling with ASDs compared with children not having an older sibling with ASDs. RESULTS The overall relative recurrence risk for ASDs was 6.9 (95% CI, 6.1-7.8), and it did not change significantly over time; similar risks were observed in maternal and paternal full-siblings. The relative recurrence risks were 2.4 (95% CI, 1.4-4.1) for maternal half-siblings and 1.5 (95% CI, 0.7-3.4) for paternal half-siblings. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our population-based recurrence risk estimate is lower than the recently reported estimates from clinical samples. Our results demonstrate no time trend in the ASDs recurrence risk as seen in the ASDs prevalence. The difference in the recurrence risk between full- and half-siblings supports the role of genetics in ASDs, while the significant recurrence risk in maternal half-siblings may support the role of factors associated with pregnancy and the maternal intrauterine environment in ASDs.","Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/*epidemiology/etiology/genetics Cohort Studies Denmark/epidemiology Female Humans Male Prevalence Proportional Hazards Models Recurrence Registries Risk *Siblings"
23972602,Neural primacy of the salience processing system in schizophrenia.,Neuron,Palaniyappan L and Simmonite M and White TP and Liddle EB and Liddle PF,Missing,"For effective information processing, two large-scale distributed neural networks appear to be critical: a multimodal executive system anchored on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and a salience system anchored on the anterior insula. Aberrant interaction among distributed networks is a feature of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. We used whole-brain Granger causal modeling using resting fMRI and observed a significant failure of both the feedforward and reciprocal influence between the insula and the DLPFC in schizophrenia. Further, a significant failure of directed influence from bilateral visual cortices to the insula was also seen in patients. These findings provide compelling evidence for a breakdown of the salience-execution loop in the clinical expression of psychosis. In addition, this offers a parsimonious explanation for the often-observed ""frontal inefficiency,"" the failure to recruit prefrontal system when salient or novel information becomes available in patients with schizophrenia.","Adult Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use Brain/blood supply/drug effects/*physiopathology *Brain Mapping Female Functional Laterality Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Models, Statistical Nerve Net/blood supply/drug effects/physiopathology Neural Networks (Computer) Neural Pathways/blood supply/drug effects/*physiopathology Oxygen Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Rest Schizophrenia/drug therapy/*pathology Statistics as Topic Time Factors Young Adult"

OBJECTIVE: To identify characteristics of melanoma and its management in the elderly compared with younger patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective population-based study of incident cases of primary melanoma in 1621 patients with stage I or II melanoma in 2004 and 2008. Questionnaires administered to physicians and a survey of cancer registries and pathology laboratories were used to obtain data. The study was conducted in 5 regions in northeastern France. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Characteristics of patients and tumors, circumstances of diagnosis, and further management in older patients (>/=70 years, 487 patients [30.0%]) compared with younger ones (<70 years, 1134 [70.0%]). RESULTS: Older patients had more frequent melanomas of the head and neck (29.4% vs 8.7%; P < .001) and of the nodular, lentigo maligna, or acral lentiginous histologic subtypes. They had thicker and more frequently ulcerated tumors, categorized as T3 or T4 in 36.7% of cases vs 20.1% in younger patients. Diagnosis of melanoma occurred more frequently in a general practice setting and less frequently in direct consultation with a dermatologist or regular screening for skin cancer. Time to definitive excision was longer in older patients, and 16.8% of them compared with 5.0% of the younger population had insufficient excision margins (P < .001). A sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 23.3% of the older patients with melanoma thicker than 1 mm vs 41.4% in the younger patients (P < .001). Adjuvant therapy was less frequently started in older patients and was prematurely stopped in a higher proportion of that population. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Age-related variations are observed at every step of melanoma management.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a home-based intervention alleviates depressive symptoms and improves quality of life in older African Americans. DESIGN: Parallel, randomized trial stratified by recruitment site. Interviewers assessing outcomes were blinded to treatment assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00511680). SETTING: A senior center and participants' homes from 2008 to 2010. PATIENTS: African Americans aged 55 years or older with depressive symptoms. INTERVENTION: A multicomponent, home-based intervention delivered by social workers or a wait-list control group that received the intervention at 4 months. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported depression severity at 4 months (primary outcome) and depression knowledge, quality of life, behavioral activation, anxiety, function, and remission at 4 and 8 months. RESULTS: Of 208 participants (106 and 102 in the intervention and wait-list groups, respectively), 182 (89 and 93, respectively) completed 4 months and 160 (79 and 81, respectively) completed 8 months. At 4 months, participants in the intervention group showed reduced depression severity (difference in mean change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score from baseline, -2.9 [95% CI, -4.6 to -1.2]; difference in mean change in Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score from baseline, -3.7 [CI, -5.4 to -2.1]); improved depression knowledge, quality of life, behavioral activation, and anxiety (P < 0.001); and improved function (P = 0.014) compared with wait-list participants. More intervention than wait-list participants entered remission at 4 months (43.8% vs. 26.9%). After treatment, control participants showed benefits similar in magnitude to those of participants in the initial intervention group. Those in the initial intervention group maintained benefits at 8 months. LIMITATION: The study had a small sample, short duration, and differential withdrawal rate. CONCLUSION: A home-based intervention delivered by social workers could reduce depressive symptoms and enhance quality of life in most older African Americans.

However, results from clinical trials have been conflicting, and several of them may have been underpowered. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials to assess the effects of probiotic supplementation on atopic sensitization and asthma/wheeze prevention in children. METHODS: Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled risk estimates. Meta-regression was conducted to examine the effect of potential factors on probiotics efficacy. RESULTS: Probiotics were effective in reducing total immunoglobulin E (IgE) (mean reduction: -7.59 U/mL [95% confidence interval (CI): -14.96 to -0.22]; P = .044). Meta-regression showed that the reduction in IgE was more pronounced with longer follow-up. Probiotics significantly reduced the risk of atopic sensitization when administered prenatally (relative risk: 0.88 [95% CI: 0.78 to 0.99]; P = .035 for positive result on the skin prick test and/or elevated specific IgE to common allergens) and postnatally (relative risk: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.75 to 0.98]; P = .027 for positive result on skin prick test). Administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus, compared with other strains, was associated with an increased risk of atopic sensitization (P = .002). Probiotics did not significantly reduce asthma/wheeze (relative risk: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.85 to 1.07]). CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal and/or early-life probiotic administration reduces the risk of atopic sensitization and decreases the total IgE level in children but may not reduce the risk of asthma/wheeze. Follow-up duration and strain significantly modified these effects. Future trials for asthma prevention should carefully select probiotic strain and consider longer follow-up.","Adolescent Asthma/immunology/*prevention & control Child Child, Preschool Dermatitis, Atopic/immunology/*prevention & control Double-Blind Method Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Immunoglobulin E/blood Infant Infant, Newborn Male Pregnancy Probiotics/*administration & dosage Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Respiratory Hypersensitivity/immunology/*prevention & control Risk Treatment Outcome"

OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk of type 2 diabetes in children and youth 6 to 24 years of age for recent initiators of antipsychotic drugs vs propensity score-matched controls who had recently initiated another psychotropic medication. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of the Tennessee Medicaid program with 28 858 recent initiators of antipsychotic drugs and 14 429 matched controls. The cohort excluded patients who previously received a diagnosis of diabetes, schizophrenia, or some other condition for which antipsychotics are the only generally recognized therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Newly diagnosed diabetes during follow-up, as identified from diagnoses and diabetes medication prescriptions. RESULTS: Users of antipsychotics had a 3-fold increased risk for type 2 diabetes (HR = 3.03 [95% CI = 1.73-5.32]), which was apparent within the first year of follow-up (HR = 2.49 [95% CI = 1.27-4.88]). The risk increased with cumulative dose during follow-up, with HRs of 2.13 (95% CI = 1.06-4.27), 3.42 (95% CI = 1.88-6.24), and 5.43 (95% CI = 2.34-12.61) for respective cumulative doses (gram equivalents of chlorpromazine) of more than 5 g, 5 to 99 g, and 100 g or more (P < .04). The risk remained elevated for up to 1 year following discontinuation of antipsychotic use (HR = 2.57 [95% CI = 1.34-4.91]). When the cohort was restricted to children 6 to 17 years of age, antipsychotic users had more than a 3-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes (HR = 3.14 [95% CI = 1.50-6.56]), and the risk increased significantly with increasing cumulative dose (P < .03). The risk was increased for use restricted to atypical antipsychotics (HR = 2.89 [95% CI = 1.64-5.10]) or to risperidone (HR = 2.20 [95% CI = 1.14-4.26]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children and youth prescribed antipsychotics had an increased risk of type 2 diabetes that increased with cumulative dose.","Adolescent Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects Child Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/chemically induced/*epidemiology Female Humans Male Psychotropic Drugs/adverse effects Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Tennessee/epidemiology"
23948001,Efficacy of initiating tobacco dependence treatment in inpatient psychiatry: a randomized controlled trial.,Am J Public Health,Prochaska JJ and Hall SE and Delucchi K and Hall SM,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the efficacy of a motivational tobacco cessation treatment combined with nicotine replacement relative to usual care initiated in inpatient psychiatry. METHODS: We randomized participants (n = 224; 79% recruitment rate) recruited from a locked acute psychiatry unit with a 100% smoking ban to intervention or usual care. Prior to hospitalization, participants averaged 19 (SD = 12) cigarettes per day; only 16% intended to quit smoking in the next 30 days. Results. Verified smoking 7-day point prevalence abstinence was significantly higher for intervention than usual care at month 3 (13.9% vs 3.2%), 6 (14.4% vs 6.5%), 12 (19.4% vs 10.9%), and 18 (20.0% vs 7.7%; odds ratio [OR] = 3.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22, 8.14; P = .018; retention > 80%). Psychiatric measures did not predict abstinence; measures of motivation and tobacco dependence did. The usual care group had a significantly greater likelihood than the intervention group of psychiatric rehospitalization (adjusted OR = 1.92; 95% CI = 1.06, 3.49). CONCLUSIONS: The findings support initiation of motivationally tailored tobacco cessation treatment during acute psychiatric hospitalization. Psychiatric severity did not moderate treatment efficacy, and cessation treatment appeared to decrease rehospitalization risk, perhaps by providing broader therapeutic benefit.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether comorbid depression in patients with type 2 diabetes accelerates cognitive decline. DESIGN: A 40-month cohort study of participants in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Memory in Diabetes (ACCORD-MIND) trial. SETTING: Fifty-two clinics organized into 6 clinical networks across the United States and Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand nine hundred seventy-seven participants with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events. INTERVENTION: The Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and the modified Stroop test were used to assess cognition. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire was used to assess depression. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mixed-effects statistical models were used to analyze cognitive test outcomes incorporating depression as a time-dependent covariate. RESULTS: Participants with scores indicative of depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, >/=10) showed greater cognitive decline during 40-month follow-up on all tests, with the following differences in estimated least squares means: Digit Symbol Substitution Test, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.25 to 1.19; P = .003), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, 0.18 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.29; P = .001), and Stroop interference, -1.06 (95% CI, -1.93 to -0.18; P = .02). This effect of depression on risk of cognitive decline did not differ according to previous cardiovascular disease; baseline cognition or age; or intensive vs standard glucose-lowering treatment, blood pressure treatment, lipid treatment, or insulin treatment. Addition of demographic and clinical covariates to models did not significantly change the cognitive decline associated with depression. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Depression in patients with type 2 diabetes was associated with greater cognitive decline in all domains, across all treatment arms, and in all participant subgroups assessed. Future randomized trials will be necessary to determine if depression treatment can lower the risk of cognitive decline in patients with diabetes.","Cardiovascular Diseases/complications/drug therapy/prevention & control Cognition Disorders/*complications/psychology Depression/*complications/psychology Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications/drug therapy/*psychology Female Fenofibrate/therapeutic use Humans Hypolipidemic Agents/therapeutic use Male Models, Statistical Neuropsychological Tests"

Data on undertreatment, treatment use, and treatment satisfaction are paramount to identify priority areas for advocacy, education, and research to improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent of nontreatment and undertreatment of psoriatic diseases, trends in treatment use, treatment satisfaction, and reasons for medication discontinuation among patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used the national survey data collected by the National Psoriasis Foundation via biannual surveys conducted from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2011, in the United States. Survey data were collected from randomly sampled patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the US population from a database of more than 76,000 patients with psoriatic diseases. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Nontreatment, undertreatment, and treatment trends determined by the use of prescription medication (topical, phototherapeutic, oral systemic, and biologic), as well as treatment satisfaction and reasons for medication discontinuation. RESULTS: A total of 5604 patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis completed the survey. From 2003 through 2011, patients who were untreated ranged from 36.6% to 49.2% of patients with mild psoriasis, 23.6% to 35.5% of patients with moderate psoriasis, and 9.4% to 29.7% of patients with severe psoriasis. Among those receiving treatment, 29.5% of patients with moderate psoriasis and 21.5% of patients with severe psoriasis were treated with topical agents alone. The most frequently used phototherapy modality is UV-B, whereas methotrexate is the most commonly used oral agent. Although adverse effects and a lack of effectiveness were primary reasons for discontinuing biological agents, the inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage was among the top reasons for discontinuation. Overall, 52.3% of patients with psoriasis and 45.5% of patients with psoriatic arthritis were dissatisfied with their treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Nontreatment and undertreatment of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis remain a significant problem in the United States. While various treatment modalities are available for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, widespread treatment dissatisfaction exists. Efforts in advocacy and education are necessary to ensure that effective treatments are accessible to this patient population.","Adult Aged Arthritis, Psoriatic/pathology/*therapy Data Collection Dermatologic Agents/*therapeutic use Female Humans Insurance Coverage/statistics & numerical data Male Methotrexate/therapeutic use Middle Aged Patient Satisfaction/*statistics & numerical data Phototherapy/*methods Physician's Practice Patterns/statistics & numerical data Psoriasis/pathology/*therapy Severity of Illness Index Treatment Outcome United States"
23979084,The transfer of drugs and therapeutics into human breast milk: an update on selected topics.,Pediatrics,Sachs HC,Missing,"Many mothers are inappropriately advised to discontinue breastfeeding or avoid taking essential medications because of fears of adverse effects on their infants. This cautious approach may be unnecessary in many cases, because only a small proportion of medications are contraindicated in breastfeeding mothers or associated with adverse effects on their infants. Information to inform physicians about the extent of excretion for a particular drug into human milk is needed but may not be available. Previous statements on this topic from the American Academy of Pediatrics provided physicians with data concerning the known excretion of specific medications into breast milk. More current and comprehensive information is now available on the Internet, as well as an application for mobile devices, at LactMed (http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov). Therefore, with the exception of radioactive compounds requiring temporary cessation of breastfeeding, the reader will be referred to LactMed to obtain the most current data on an individual medication. This report discusses several topics of interest surrounding lactation, such as the use of psychotropic therapies, drugs to treat substance abuse, narcotics, galactagogues, and herbal products, as well as immunization of breastfeeding women. A discussion regarding the global implications of maternal medications and lactation in the developing world is beyond the scope of this report.

Medicare has provided aggregate incentive payment data, but still missing is an understanding of how these payments are distributed across hospital types and years. Our analysis of Medicare data found a substantial increase in the percentage of hospitals receiving EHR incentive payments between 2011 (17.4 percent) and 2012 (36.8 percent). However, this increase was not uniform across all hospitals, and the overall proportion of hospitals receiving a payment for meaningful use was low. Critical-access, smaller, and publicly owned or nonprofit hospitals appeared to be at particular risk for failing to meet Medicare's meaningful-use criteria, and the overall proportion of hospitals receiving a payment for meaningful use was low. Starting in 2015, hospitals that fail to meet the criteria will be subject to financial penalties. To address the needs of institutions in danger of incurring these penalties, policy makers could implement targeted grant programs and provide additional information technology workforce support. In addition, the capacity of EHR system vendors should be carefully monitored to ensure that these institutions have access to the technology they need.",Electronic Health Records/*trends/*utilization Health Care Reform/trends/utilization Humans Meaningful Use/*trends/*utilization United States Utilization Review/statistics & numerical data

Although the long-term physical adverse effects of radiation therapy (RT) for head and neck cancer have been well described, relatively few studies have evaluated psychosocial functioning after treatment. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of self-reported depression among survivors of head and neck cancer returning for follow-up after being treated with RT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analysis among 211 comprehensive cancer center patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who had been previously treated with RT and were disease-free with at least 1 year of follow-up. Patients with a history of mood disorder, use of mental health services in the past, or previous or current use of antidepressants or anxiolytics, excluding sleep medications, were specifically excluded. INTERVENTIONS: The University of Washington Quality of Life instrument (UW-QOL), a brief, previously validated, self-administered questionnaire, was used to analyze rates of depression. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The UW-QOL assigned scores of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 subjective responses of mood being ""extremely depressed,"" ""somewhat depressed,"" ""neither in a good mood or depressed,"" ""generally good,"" and ""excellent,"" respectively. RESULTS: The mean mood score did not differ at 1, 3, and 5 years after treatment, with scores of 52.0, 55.7, and 62.1, respectively. The proportion of patients who reported their mood as ""somewhat depressed"" or ""extremely depressed"" was 17%, 15%, and 13% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Variables that were significantly associated with post-RT depression included the presence of tracheostomy tube or laryngeal stoma (P = .01), gastrostomy tube dependence (P = .01), and continued smoking at the time of follow-up (P < .001). Among the patients reporting their mood as either ""somewhat depressed"" or ""extremely depressed"" at 1, 3, and 5 years, the proportion using antidepressants at the time was 6%, 11%, and 0%, respectively. The corresponding proportion of patients actively undergoing or seeking psychotherapy and/or counseling was 3%, 6%, and 0%, respectively.

However, there is a lack of synthesised information to establish whether there are differences in morbidity and mortality, effectiveness and psychosocial outcomes between midwife-led continuity models and other models of care. OBJECTIVES: To compare midwife-led continuity models of care with other models of care for childbearing women and their infants. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 January 2013) and reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: All published and unpublished trials in which pregnant women are randomly allocated to midwife-led continuity models of care or other models of care during pregnancy and birth. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All review authors evaluated methodological quality. Two review authors checked data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 trials involving 16,242 women. Women who had midwife-led continuity models of care were less likely to experience regional analgesia (average risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.90), episiotomy (average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92), and instrumental birth (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96), and were more likely to experience no intrapartum analgesia/anaesthesia (average RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.31), spontaneous vaginal birth (average RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.08), attendance at birth by a known midwife (average RR 7.83, 95% CI 4.15 to 14.80), and a longer mean length of labour (hours) (mean difference (hours) 0.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.74). There were no differences between groups for caesarean births (average RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.02).Women who were randomised to receive midwife-led continuity models of care were less likely to experience preterm birth (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94) and fetal loss before 24 weeks' gestation (average RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.99), although there were no differences in fetal loss/neonatal death of at least 24 weeks (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.51) or in overall fetal/neonatal death (average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.00).Due to a lack of consistency in measuring women's satisfaction and assessing the cost of various maternity models, these outcomes were reported narratively. The majority of included studies reported a higher rate of maternal satisfaction in the midwifery-led continuity care model. Similarly there was a trend towards a cost-saving effect for midwife-led continuity care compared to other care models. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Most women should be offered midwife-led continuity models of care and women should be encouraged to ask for this option although caution should be exercised in applying this advice to women with substantial medical or obstetric complications.","Analgesia, Obstetrical/utilization Cesarean Section/utilization Continuity of Patient Care/*organization & administration Episiotomy/utilization Female Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Midwifery/economics/*methods/organization & administration Models, Organizational Patient Satisfaction Perinatal Care/*methods/organization & administration Postnatal Care/*methods/organization & administration Pregnancy Prenatal Care/*methods/organization & administration Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"
23986399,Molecular mechanism for age-related memory loss: the histone-binding protein RbAp48.,Sci Transl Med,Pavlopoulos E and Jones S and Kosmidis S and Close M and Kim C and Kovalerchik O and Small SA and Kandel ER,Missing,"To distinguish age-related memory loss more explicitly from Alzheimer's disease (AD), we have explored its molecular underpinning in the dentate gyrus (DG), a subregion of the hippocampal formation thought to be targeted by aging. We carried out a gene expression study in human postmortem tissue harvested from both DG and entorhinal cortex (EC), a neighboring subregion unaffected by aging and known to be the site of onset of AD. Using expression in the EC for normalization, we identified 17 genes that manifested reliable age-related changes in the DG. The most significant change was an age-related decline in RbAp48, a histone-binding protein that modifies histone acetylation. To test whether the RbAp48 decline could be responsible for age-related memory loss, we turned to mice and found that, consistent with humans, RbAp48 was less abundant in the DG of old than in young mice. We next generated a transgenic mouse that expressed a dominant-negative inhibitor of RbAp48 in the adult forebrain. Inhibition of RbAp48 in young mice caused hippocampus-dependent memory deficits similar to those associated with aging, as measured by novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies showed that within the hippocampal formation, dysfunction was selectively observed in the DG, and this corresponded to a regionally selective decrease in histone acetylation. Up-regulation of RbAp48 in the DG of aged wild-type mice ameliorated age-related hippocampus-based memory loss and age-related abnormalities in histone acetylation. Together, these findings show that the DG is a hippocampal subregion targeted by aging, and identify molecular mechanisms of cognitive aging that could serve as valid targets for therapeutic intervention.","Acetylation Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Aging/metabolism/pathology Animals Dentate Gyrus/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology Female Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental Genes, Dominant/genetics Histone Acetyltransferases/metabolism Histones/*metabolism Humans Male Membrane Proteins/metabolism Memory Disorders/*metabolism/physiopathology Mice Middle Aged Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Organ Specificity/genetics Phosphoproteins/metabolism Protein Binding RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 4/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism"

METHODS: We searched the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System for cases of magnetic foreign bodies in children younger than 21 years in the United States, from 2002 to 2011. Cases were analyzed by location: alimentary or respiratory tract, nasal cavity, ear canal, or genital area. RESULTS: We identified 893 cases of magnetic foreign bodies, corresponding to 22,581 magnetic foreign body cases during a 10-year period (95% confidence interval [CI] 17,694 to 27,469). Most magnetic foreign bodies were ingested (74%) or intranasal (21%). Mean age was 5.2 years for ingested magnetic foreign bodies and 10.1 years for nasal magnetic foreign bodies (difference 4.9; 95% CI 4.1 to 5.6), suggesting different circumstances of injury. The incidence of pediatric magnet ingestions increased from 2002 to 2003 from 0.57 cases per 100,000 children per year (95% CI 0.22 to 0.92) to a peak in 2010 to 2011 of 3.06 cases per 100,000 children per year (95% CI 2.16 to 3.96). Most ingested magnetic foreign bodies (73%) and multiple magnet ingestions (91%) occurred in 2007 or later. Patients were admitted in 15.7% of multiple magnet ingestions versus 2.3% of single magnet ingestions (difference 13.4%; 95% CI 2.8% to 24.0%). CONCLUSION: Magnet-related injuries are an increasing public health problem for young children, as well for older children who may use magnets for play or to imitate piercings. Education and improved magnet safety standards may decrease the risk small magnets pose to children.","Child Child, Preschool Digestive System Ear Canal Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data Female Foreign Bodies/*epidemiology/therapy Genitalia Humans Incidence *Magnets Male Nose Respiratory System Retrospective Studies United States/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of interventions to improve water quality and supply (adequate quantity to maintain hygiene practices), provide adequate sanitation and promote handwashing with soap, on the nutritional status of children under the age of 18 years and to identify current research gaps. SEARCH METHODS: We searched 10 English-language (including MEDLINE and CENTRAL) and three Chinese-language databases for published studies in June 2012. We searched grey literature databases, conference proceedings and websites, reviewed reference lists and contacted experts and authors. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised (including cluster-randomised), quasi-randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, controlled cohort or cross-sectional studies and historically controlled studies, comparing WASH interventions among children aged under 18 years. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently sought and extracted data on childhood anthropometry, biochemical measures of micronutrient status, and adherence, attrition and costs either from published reports or through contact with study investigators. We calculated mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We conducted study-level and individual-level meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect for randomised controlled trials only. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen studies (five cluster-randomised controlled trials and nine non-randomised studies with comparison groups) from 10 low- and middle-income countries including 22,241 children at baseline and nutrition outcome data for 9,469 children provided relevant information. Study duration ranged from 6 to 60 months and all studies included children under five years of age at the time of the intervention. Studies included WASH interventions either singly or in combination. Measures of child anthropometry were collected in all 14 studies, and nine studies reported at least one of the following anthropometric indices: weight-for-height, weight-for-age or height-for-age. None of the included studies were of high methodological quality as none of the studies masked the nature of the intervention from participants.Weight-for-age, weight-for-height and height-for-age z-scores were available for five cluster-randomised controlled trials with a duration of between 9 and 12 months. Meta-analysis including 4,627 children identified no evidence of an effect of WASH interventions on weight-for-age z-score (MD 0.05; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.12). Meta-analysis including 4,622 children identified no evidence of an effect of WASH interventions on weight-for-height z-score (MD 0.02; 95% CI -0.07 to 0.11). Meta-analysis including 4,627 children identified a borderline statistically significant effect of WASH interventions on height-for-age z-score (MD 0.08; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.16). These findings were supported by individual participant data analysis including information on 5,375 to 5,386 children from five cluster-randomised controlled trials.No study reported adverse events. Adherence to study interventions was reported in only two studies (both cluster-randomised controlled trials) and ranged from low (< 35%) to high (> 90%). Study attrition was reported in seven studies and ranged from 4% to 16.5%. Intervention cost was reported in one study in which the total cost of the WASH interventions was USD 15/inhabitant. None of the studies reported differential impacts relevant to equity issues such as gender, socioeconomic status and religion. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence from meta-analysis of data from cluster-randomised controlled trials with an intervention period of 9-12 months is suggestive of a small benefit of WASH interventions (specifically solar disinfection of water, provision of soap, and improvement of water quality) on length growth in children under five years of age. The duration of the intervention studies was relatively short and none of the included studies is of high methodological quality. Very few studies provided information on intervention adherence, attrition and costs. There are several ongoing trials in low-income country settings that may provide robust evidence to inform these findings.","Age Factors Body Height Body Weight Child, Preschool Developing Countries Hand Disinfection/*standards Humans Hygiene/*standards Infant Malnutrition/prevention & control *Nutritional Status Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Sanitation/methods/*standards Water Quality/*standards Water Supply/*standards"

This photic resetting involves cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated upregulation of Per genes within individual cells of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Our detailed understanding of this pathway is poor, and it remains unclear why entrainment to a new time zone takes several days. By analyzing the light-regulated transcriptome of the SCN, we have identified a key role for salt inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) and CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) in clock re-setting. An entrainment stimulus causes CRTC1 to coactivate CREB, inducing the expression of Per1 and Sik1. SIK1 then inhibits further shifts of the clock by phosphorylation and deactivation of CRTC1. Knockdown of Sik1 within the SCN results in increased behavioral phase shifts and rapid re-entrainment following experimental jet lag. Thus SIK1 provides negative feedback, acting to suppress the effects of light on the clock. This pathway provides a potential target for the regulation of circadian rhythms.","Active Transport, Cell Nucleus Animals *Circadian Clocks Circadian Rhythm Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism Gene Knockdown Techniques Mice Mice, Inbred C57BL Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism Rod Opsins/genetics/metabolism *Signal Transduction Suprachiasmatic Nucleus/metabolism Transcription Factors/metabolism Transcription, Genetic"

However, adaptive expression of feelings and communication with one's social network can pose challenges for patients with cancer. We report on a randomized controlled trial of an intervention, Project Connect Online, for patients with breast cancer to create personal Web sites to chronicle their experience and communicate with their social network. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women (N = 88) diagnosed with breast cancer (any stage, any interval since diagnosis) were randomly assigned to participate in a 3-hour workshop for hands-on creation of personal Web sites with a follow-up call to facilitate Web site use, or to a waiting-list control. Assessed before randomization and 6 months after the intervention, dependent variables included depressive symptoms, positive and negative mood, cancer-related intrusive thoughts, and perceived cancer-related benefits in life appreciation and strengthened relationships. RESULTS: Relative to control participants, women randomly assigned to Project Connect Online evidenced significant benefit 6 months later on depressive symptoms, positive mood, and life appreciation, but not negative mood, perceived strengthened relationships, or intrusive thoughts. Treatment status moderated the intervention effects, such that women currently undergoing medical treatment for cancer benefitted significantly more from the intervention on depressive symptoms and positive mood than did women not receiving treatment.

OBJECTIVES: To assess mortality risk among adult patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder participating in clinical trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market and to evaluate if psychopharmacological agents worsen this risk. DATA SOURCES: The FDA Summary Basis of Approval (SBA) reports of new drug applications and supplemental applications for 28 psychopharmacological agents approved between 1990 and 2011. STUDY SELECTION: The FDA SBA reports detailing exposure data from acute placebo-controlled trials and safety extension studies including 92,542 patients from 47 adult drug approval programs for treatment of schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and SBA reports on combination and maintenance therapy programs for treatments of bipolar disorder. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We reviewed and synthesized mortality data from SBA reports that combined mortality rates across the clinical trials, including information on patient exposure years (PEY) for active treatments and placebo for individual indications. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall mortality rate per 100,000 PEY in relation to the psychiatric diagnosis of the patients participating in psychopharmacology clinical trials. Also, the overall mortality rates using PEY technique among patients assigned to psychopharmacological agents or placebo were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, mortality risk was high and significantly associated with psychiatric diagnosis (chi(2)(4) = 1760; P < .001). Compared with the general adult population, patients with schizophrenia had the highest mortality risk (3.8-fold increase), followed by patients with depression (3.15-fold increase) and bipolar disorder (3.0-fold increase). The mortality risk was not increased when patients were assigned to psychotropic agents rather than placebo except for heterocyclic antidepressants. Suicide accounted for 109 of all 265 deaths (41.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data suggest that increased mortality rates reported in population studies are detectable among adult patients with psychiatric illnesses participating in psychopharmacological trials. Furthermore, 3- to 4-month exposure to modern psychotropic agents, such as atypical antipsychotic agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors does not worsen this risk. Given the inherent limitations of the FDA SBA reports, further research is needed to support firm conclusions.",Adult Age Factors Aged Clinical Trials as Topic/*adverse effects Female Humans Male Mental Disorders/*mortality Middle Aged Psychotropic Drugs/*adverse effects Risk Factors Suicide/statistics & numerical data United States/epidemiology

Lifestyle interventions, such as exercise, are recommended in conjunction with drugs and cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of impaired sleep. Preliminary evidence indicates that yoga-a mind-body practice and form of exercise-may improve sleep among cancer survivors. The primary aim of this randomized, controlled clinical trial was to determine the efficacy of a standardized yoga intervention compared with standard care for improving global sleep quality (primary outcome) among post-treatment cancer survivors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 410 survivors suffering from moderate or greater sleep disruption between 2 and 24 months after surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy were randomly assigned to standard care or standard care plus the 4-week yoga intervention. The yoga intervention used the Yoga for Cancer Survivors (YOCAS) program consisting of pranayama (breathing exercises), 16 Gentle Hatha and Restorative yoga asanas (postures), and meditation. Participants attended two 75-minute sessions per week. Sleep quality was assessed by using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and actigraphy pre- and postintervention. RESULTS: In all, 410 survivors were accrued (96% female; mean age, 54 years; 75% had breast cancer). Yoga participants demonstrated greater improvements in global sleep quality and, secondarily, subjective sleep quality, daytime dysfunction, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and medication use at postintervention (all P </= .05) compared with standard care participants. CONCLUSION: Yoga, specifically the YOCAS program, is a useful treatment for improving sleep quality and reducing sleep medication use among cancer survivors.",*Breathing Exercises Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Intervention Studies Male Meditation/*psychology Middle Aged *Mind-Body Therapies Neoplasm Staging Neoplasms/*psychology/therapy Patient Education as Topic Prognosis *Quality of Life Sleep Disorders/psychology/*therapy Survival Rate Survivors/*psychology

In 2008 North Carolina initiated a statewide population-based transitional care initiative to prevent recurrent hospitalizations among high-risk Medicaid recipients with complex chronic medical conditions. In a study of patients hospitalized during 2010-11, we found that those who received transitional care were 20 percent less likely to experience a readmission during the subsequent year, compared to clinically similar patients who received usual care. Benefits of the intervention were greatest among patients with the highest readmission risk. One readmission was averted for every six patients who received transitional care services and one for every three of the highest-risk patients. This study suggests that locally embedded, targeted care coordination interventions can effectively reduce hospitalizations for high-risk populations.",Aged Case Management/economics/utilization Chronic Disease/*economics/rehabilitation Community Health Services/*economics Continuity of Patient Care/*economics/statistics & numerical data Cost Savings/*economics Female Humans Male Medicaid/*economics/utilization Medicare/economics Middle Aged North Carolina Patient Readmission/*economics/statistics & numerical data Primary Health Care/*economics/utilization Risk Assessment United States Utilization Review

To gain information on the CN mechanism, the relationship between the changes of electrical potential and movement in the circumnutating sunflower stem and effect of ion channels and proton pump inhibitors on CN parameters were evaluated. Long-term electrophysiological measurements and injection of solutions of ion channel inhibitors (ICI) into sunflower stem, with the simultaneous time-lapse recording of the movement were made. The oscillations of electrical potential (OEP) - movement relations, consist of cells depolarization on the deflected side of the stem and, at this same time, cells hyperpolarization on the opposite side of the stem. The delay of organ movement in relation to electrical changes of approx. 28 min. (22% of the period), may indicate that the ionic fluxes causing the OEP are the primary phenomenon. The biggest decrease of CN period was observed after injection of proton pump (approx. 26%) and cation channel (approx. 25%) inhibitors, while length and amplitude were reduced mainly by calcium channel inhibitors (approx. 67%). Existence of OEP only in circumnutating part of sunflower stem and reduction of CN parameters and OEP amplitude after application of ICI proves that the CN cellular mechanism is associated with transmembrane ion transport.",Missing

Warmer temperatures accelerate growth and reproduction of ectotherms, whereas these processes are slowed or halted in colder temperatures. Female blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus inhabiting the Chesapeake Bay, exhibit a seasonal migratory behavior that is closely tied with spawning and the release of larvae. To better understand reproductive activities of the migratory adult females, we examined two reproductive parameters of these crabs sampled monthly (April-December, 2006): the levels of vitellogenin (VtG) in the hemolymph and VtG expression in the hepatopancreas and ovary. The full-length cDNA of VtG (CasVtG-ova) has been isolated from the ovary. The putative CasVtG sequence found in the ovary is >99% identical to that of the hepatopancreas and is related most closely to the sequences reported in other crab species. In female C. sapidus, the hepatopancreas produces over 99% of the total VtG toward the ovarian development. Ovarian stages 2 and 3 in the sampled females are characterized by significant high levels of VtG in hemolymph and VtG expression in both the hepatopancreas and ovary. However, during the southbound migration in fall, females at ovarian stages 2 and 3 have decreased VtG levels, compared to those in spring and summer. The decreased vitellogenesis activity during the fall migration suggests seasonal adaptation to ensure successful spawning and the larval release.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of post-MI dietary quality and changes from pre- to post-MI with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among MI survivors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We included 2258 women from the Nurses' Health Study and 1840 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Participants had survived an initial MI during the study follow-up period and completed the pre- and post-MI food frequency questionnaire. Diet quality was measured using Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI2010), which consists of food and nutrients associated with the risk of chronic disease reported in the literature. We adjusted for medication use, medical history, and lifestyle risk factors using Cox proportional hazards regression models. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: During follow-up, we confirmed 682 all-cause deaths for women and 451 for men. The median survival time after the initial MI onset was 8.7 years for women and 9.0 years for men. When the results were pooled, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.60-0.96) for all-cause mortality and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.51-1.04) for cardiovascular mortality, comparing the extreme quintiles of post-MI AHEI2010. A greater increase in the AHEI2010 score from pre- to post-MI was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality (pooled HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.91) and cardiovascular mortality (pooled HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41- 0.86), comparing the extreme quintiles. The adjusted HRs associated with post-MI AHEI2010 were 0.73 (95% CI, 0.58-0.93) for all-cause mortality and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.64-1.04) for cardiovascular mortality when the alcohol component was excluded.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of local methylprednisolone injections in CTS. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00806871). SETTING: Regional referral orthopedic department in Sweden. PATIENTS: Patients aged 18 to 70 years with CTS but no previous steroid injections. INTERVENTION: Three groups (37 patients each) received 80 mg of methylprednisolone, 40 mg of methylprednisolone, or placebo. The patients and treating surgeons were blinded. MEASUREMENTS: Primary end points were the change in CTS symptom severity scores at 10 weeks (range, 1 to 5) and rate of surgery at 1 year. Three patients had missing 10-week data. All patients had 1-year data. RESULTS: Improvement in CTS symptom severity scores at 10 weeks was greater in patients who received 80 mg of methylprednisolone and 40 mg of methylprednisolone than in those who received placebo (difference in change from baseline, -0.64 [95% CI, -1.06 to -0.21; P = 0.003] and -0.88 [CI, -1.30 to -0.46; P < 0.001], respectively), but there were no significant differences at 1 year. The 1-year rates of surgery were 73%, 81%, and 92% in the 80-mg methylprednisolone, 40-mg methylprednisolone, and placebo groups, respectively. Compared with patients who received placebo, those who received 80 mg of methylprednisolone were less likely to have surgery (odds ratio, 0.24 [CI, 0.06 to 0.95]; P = 0.042). With time to surgery incorporated, both the 80- and 40-mg methylprednisolone groups had lower likelihood of surgery (hazard ratio, 0.46 [CI, 0.27 to 0.77; P = 0.003] and 0.57 [CI, 0.35 to 0.94; P = 0.026], respectively). LIMITATION: The study was conducted at 1 center, and wrist splinting had previously failed for all patients. CONCLUSION: Methylprednisolone injections for CTS have significant benefits in relieving symptoms at 10 weeks and reducing the rate of surgery 1 year after treatment, but 3 out of 4 patients had surgery within 1 year.

In 2006, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund released a joint statement that recommended limiting use of iron supplements (tablets or liquids) among children in malaria-endemic areas because of concern about increased malaria risk. As a result, anemia control programs were either not initiated or stopped in these areas. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of providing a micronutrient powder (MNP) with or without iron on the incidence of malaria among children living in a high malaria-burden area. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Double-blind, cluster randomized trial of children aged 6 to 35 months (n = 1958 living in 1552 clusters) conducted over 6 months in 2010 in a rural community setting in central Ghana, West Africa. A cluster was defined as a compound including 1 or more households. Children were excluded if iron supplement use occurred within the past 6 months, they had severe anemia (hemoglobin level <7 g/dL), or severe wasting (weight-for-length z score <-3). INTERVENTIONS: Children were randomized by cluster to receive a MNP with iron (iron group; 12.5 mg/d of iron) or without iron (no iron group). The MNP with and without iron were added to semiliquid home-prepared foods daily for 5 months followed by 1-month of further monitoring. Insecticide-treated bed nets were provided at enrollment, as well as malaria treatment when indicated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Malaria episodes in the iron group compared with the no iron group during the 5-month intervention period. RESULTS: In intention-to-treat analyses, malaria incidence overall was significantly lower in the iron group compared with the no iron group (76.1 and 86.1 episodes/100 child-years, respectively; risk ratio (RR), 0.87 [95% CI, 0.79-0.97]), and during the intervention period (79.4 and 90.7 episodes/100 child-years, respectively; RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.78-0.96]). In secondary analyses, these differences were no longer statistically significant after adjusting for baseline iron deficiency and anemia status overall (adjusted RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75-1.01) and during the intervention period (adjusted RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74-1.00). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In a malaria-endemic setting in which insecticide-treated bed nets were provided and appropriate malaria treatment was available, daily use of a MNP with iron did not result in an increased incidence of malaria among young children.

23999956,Prevention of traumatic stress in mothers with preterm infants: a randomized controlled trial.,Pediatrics,Shaw RJ and St John N and Lilo EA and Jo B and Benitz W and Stevenson DK and Horwitz SM,stanford,"OBJECTIVE: The current study evaluates a treatment intervention developed with the goal of reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety in parents of premature infants. METHODS: A total of 105 mothers of preterm infants (25-34 weeks' gestational age; >600 g) were randomized to receive a 6-session intervention developed to target parental trauma as well as facilitate infant redefinition (n = 62) or to an active comparison group (n = 43). Mothers in the intervention group received a combination of trauma-focused treatments, including psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, progressive muscle relaxation, and development of their trauma narrative. The intervention also incorporated material targeting infant redefinition, defined as the process of changing the mother's negative perceptions of her infant and the parenting experience. RESULTS: Mothers in the intervention group reported a greater reduction in both trauma symptoms (Cohen's d = 0.41, P = .023) and depression (Cohen's d = 0.59, P < .001) compared with the comparison group. Patients under both conditions improved significantly in terms of anxiety, with no differences between groups. Results of the moderator analysis showed that mothers with higher ratings of baseline NICU stress benefited more from the intervention compared with mothers who had lower ratings (P = .036). CONCLUSIONS: This short, highly manualized intervention for mothers of preterm infants statistically significantly reduced symptoms of trauma and depression. The intervention is feasible, can be delivered with fidelity, and has high ratings of maternal satisfaction. Given that improvements in mothers' distress may lead to improved infant outcomes, this intervention has the potential for a high public health impact.","Adult Depression/prevention & control/psychology Female Humans Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature/*psychology Maternal Welfare/*psychology Mothers/*psychology Patient Education as Topic/*methods Pregnancy Questionnaires Stress, Psychological/*prevention & control/*psychology"

METHODS: We used data from the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study, a US national sample of 132,674 females (with a 64.3% response rate) and 124,665 males (with a 62.0% response rate) 12 years of age and older. Data were previously collected on migraine symptoms, onset age, and demographics. Previously validated methods applied to the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study data were used to simulate a cohort study. Incidence and remission rates were estimated within 3 sex-specific HH income groups (<$22,500, $22,500-$59,999, and >/=$60,000). The chi(2) test was used to determine whether the incidence or remission rates differed by HH income group as an explanation for differences in migraine prevalence by HH income. RESULTS: Migraine prevalence increased as HH income decreased for females (chi(2), p < 0.01) and males (chi(2), p < 0.01). Differences were not explained by race and other known confounders. Variation in prevalence was explained, in large part, by a higher incidence rate in the lower HH income groups for both females (chi(2), p < 0.01) and males (chi(2), p < 0.01). Migraine remission rates did not differ by HH income. CONCLUSIONS: The higher incidence of migraine in lower HH income groups is compatible with the social causation hypothesis.

Participants were from 628 communities in 3 high-income countries (HIC), 10 upper-middle-income and low-middle-income countries (UMIC and LMIC), and 4 low-income countries (LIC). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hypertension was defined as individuals with self-reported treated hypertension or with an average of 2 blood pressure measurements of at least 140/90 mm Hg using an automated digital device. Awareness was based on self-reports, treatment was based on the regular use of blood pressure-lowering medications, and control was defined as individuals with blood pressure lower than 140/90 mm Hg.

We examined the relationship between medication non-adherence and health care use in children and adolescents who have a chronic medical condition. METHODS: A systematic review of articles by using PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL was conducted. Additional studies were identified by searching reference sections of relevant manuscripts. Studies that tested the relationship between medication non-adherence and health care use (ie, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, outpatient visits) or cost in children and adolescents (mean age </=18 years) who have a chronic medical condition were included. Extraction of articles was completed by using predefined data fields. RESULTS: Ten studies met our inclusion criteria. Nine of the 10 studies reviewed (90%) demonstrated a relationship between medication non-adherence and increased health care use. The directionality of this relationship varied depending on the outcome variable of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Medication non-adherence is related to increased health care use in children and adolescents who have a chronic medical condition and should be addressed in clinical care.

We studied changes in QOL from time of BC diagnosis to long-term survivorship and compared QOL in long-term survivors to that of age-matched women with no history of BC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 535 women with localized BC (T1-3N0-1M0) were recruited from 1989 to 1996 and followed prospectively, completing QOL questionnaires at diagnosis and 1 year postdiagnosis. Between 2005 and 2007, those alive without distant recurrence were recontacted to participate in a long-term follow-up (LTFU) study. A control group was recruited from women presenting for screening mammograms, and both groups completed LTFU QOL questionnaires. Longitudinal change in BC survivors and differences between BC survivors and controls were assessed in eight broad categories with clinically significant differences set at 5% and 10% of the breadth of each QOL scale. RESULTS: A total of 285 patients with BC were included in the study, on average 12.5 years postdiagnosis. Longitudinally, clinically significant improvements were observed in overall QOL by 1 year postdiagnosis with further improvements by LTFU. Some clinically significant improvements over time were seen in all categories. A total of 167 controls were recruited. Deficits were observed in self-reported cognitive functioning (5.3% difference) and financial impact (6.3% difference) in BC survivors at LTFU compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Long-term BC survivors show improvement in many domains of QOL over time, and they appear to have similar QOL in most respects to age-matched noncancer controls, although small deficits in cognition and finances were identified.","Adult Aged Breast Neoplasms/mortality/*psychology/therapy Case-Control Studies Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Longitudinal Studies Middle Aged Neoplasm Grading Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/mortality/*psychology/therapy Neoplasm Staging Prognosis *Quality of Life Questionnaires Self Report Survival Rate Survivors/*psychology"

METHODS: Electronic International Classification of Diseases data from the US Department of Defense (DoD) Birth and Infant Health Registry were used to identify infants born to military families from 1998 through 2005 (N = 676 827) who met the study definition for AHT. DoD Family Advocacy Program data were used to identify infants with substantiated reports of abuse. Rates within the military were compared with civilian population rates by applying an alternate AHT case definition used in a civilian study. RESULTS: Applying the study definition, the estimated rate of substantiated military AHT was 34.0 cases in the first year of life per 100 000 live births. Using the alternate case definition, the estimated AHT rate was 25.6 cases per 100 000 live births. Infant risk factors for AHT included male sex, premature birth, and a diagnosed major birth defect. Parental risk factors included young maternal age (<21 years), lower sponsor rank or pay grade, and current maternal military service. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large database study of AHT with the ability to link investigative results to cases. Overall rates of AHT were consistent with civilian populations when using the same case definition codes.

Individual randomized trials and meta-analyses demonstrate statistically significant mortality reductions in all age groups invited to screening. In women actually screened, mortality reductions are greater. Individual trials and meta-analyses show varying rates of mortality reduction, leading to questions about screening's value and whether treatment advances have diminished the importance of early detection. This study hypothesized that breast cancer deaths predominantly occurred in unscreened women. METHODS: Invasive breast cancers diagnosed between 1990 and 1999 were followed through 2007. Data included demographics, mammography use, surgical and pathology reports, and recurrence and death dates. Mammograms were categorized as screening or diagnostic based on absence or presence of breast signs or symptoms, and were substantiated by medical records. Breast cancer deaths were defined after documentation of prior distant metastases. Absence of recurrent cancer and lethal other diseases defined death from other causes. RESULTS: Invasive breast cancer failure analysis defined 7301 patients between 1990 and 1999, with 1705 documented deaths from breast cancer (n = 609) or other causes (n = 905). Among 609 confirmed breast cancer deaths, 29% were among women who had been screened (19% screen-detected and 10% interval cancers), whereas 71% were among unscreened women, including > 2 years since last mammogram (6%), or never screened (65%). Overall, 29% of cancer deaths were screened, whereas 71% were unscreened. Median age at diagnosis of fatal cancers was 49 years; in deaths not from breast cancer, median age at diagnosis was 72 years. CONCLUSIONS: Most deaths from breast cancer occur in unscreened women. To maximize mortality reduction and life-years gained, initiation of regular screening before age 50 years should be encouraged. Cancer 2014;120:2839-2846. (c) 2013 American Cancer Society.",Missing
24018712,The frequency and cost of treatment perceived to be futile in critical care.,JAMA Intern Med,Huynh TN and Kleerup EC and Wiley JF and Savitsky TD and Guse D and Garber BJ and Wenger NS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Physicians often perceive as futile intensive care interventions that prolong life without achieving an effect that the patient can appreciate as a benefit. The prevalence and cost of critical care perceived to be futile have not been prospectively quantified. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the prevalence and cost of treatment perceived to be futile in adult critical care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: To develop a common definition of futile care, we convened a focus group of clinicians who care for critically ill patients. On a daily basis for 3 months, we surveyed critical care specialists in 5 intensive care units (ICUs) at an academic health care system to identify patients whom the physicians believed were receiving futile treatment. Using a multivariate model, we identified patient and clinician characteristics associated with patients perceived to be receiving futile treatment. We estimated the total cost of futile treatment by summing the charges of each day of receiving perceived futile treatment and converting to costs. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Prevalence of patients perceived to be receiving futile treatment. RESULTS: During a 3-month period, there were 6916 assessments by 36 critical care specialists of 1136 patients. Of these patients, 904 (80%) were never perceived to be receiving futile treatment, 98 (8.6%) were perceived as receiving probably futile treatment, 123 (11%) were perceived as receiving futile treatment, and 11 (1%) were perceived as receiving futile treatment only on the day they transitioned to palliative care. The patients with futile treatment assessments received 464 days of treatment perceived to be futile in critical care (range, 1-58 days), accounting for 6.7% of all assessed patient days in the 5 ICUs studied. Eighty-four of the 123 patients perceived as receiving futile treatment died before hospital discharge and 20 within 6 months of ICU care (6-month mortality rate of 85%), with survivors remaining in severely compromised health states. The cost of futile treatment in critical care was estimated at $2.6 million. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In 1 health system, treatment in critical care that is perceived to be futile is common and the cost is substantial.",Attitude of Health Personnel Critical Care/economics/psychology/*standards/statistics & numerical data Female Humans Intensive Care Units/economics/statistics & numerical data Male Medical Futility/*psychology Middle Aged Prospective Studies
24019271,Potential adult Medicaid beneficiaries under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act compared with current adult Medicaid beneficiaries.,Ann Fam Med,Chang T and Davis M,Missing,"PURPOSE: Under health care reform, states will have the opportunity to expand Medicaid to millions of uninsured US adults. Information regarding this population is vital to physicians as they prepare for more patients with coverage. Our objective was to describe demographic and health characteristics of potentially eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-2010) to identify and compare adult US citizens potentially eligible for Medicaid under provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) with current adult Medicaid beneficiaries. We compared demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education) and health measures (self-reported health status; measured body mass index, hemoglobin A1c level, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, depression screen [9-item Patient Health Questionnaire], tobacco smoking, and alcohol use). RESULTS: Analyses were based on an estimated 13.8 million current adult non-elderly Medicaid beneficiaries and 13.6 million nonelderly adults potentially eligible for Medicaid. Potentially eligible individuals are expected to be more likely male (49.2% potentially eligible vs 33.3% current beneficiaries; P <.001), to be more likely white and less likely black (58.8% white, 20.0% black vs 49.9% white, 25.2% black; P = .02), and to be statistically indistinguishable in terms of educational attainment. Overall, potentially eligible adults are expected to have better health status (34.8% ""excellent"" or ""very good,"" 40.4% ""good"") than current beneficiaries (33.5% ""excellent"" or ""very good,"" 31.6% ""good""; P <.001). The proportions obese (34.5% vs 42.9%; P = .008) and with depression (15.5% vs 22.3%; P = .003) among potentially eligible individuals are significantly lower than those for current beneficiaries, while there are no significant differences in the expected prevalence of diabetes or hypertension. Current tobacco smoking (49.2% vs 38.0%; P = .002), and moderate and heavier alcohol use (21.6% vs 16.0% and 16.5% vs 9.8%; P <.001, respectively) are more common among the potentially eligible population than among current beneficiaries. CONCLUSIONS: Under the ACA, physicians can anticipate a potentially eligible Medicaid population with equal if not better current health status and lower prevalence of obesity and depression than current Medicaid beneficiaries. Federal Medicaid expenditures for newly covered beneficiaries therefore may not be as high as anticipated in the short term. Given the higher prevalence of tobacco smoking and alcohol use, however, broad enrollment and engagement of this potentially eligible population is needed to address their higher prevalence of modifiable risk factors for future chronic disease.",Adult African Americans/statistics & numerical data Alcohol Drinking/epidemiology Cross-Sectional Studies Educational Status European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Female Health Services Needs and Demand/*statistics & numerical data Health Status Humans Male *Medicaid Medically Uninsured/*statistics & numerical data Nutrition Surveys/statistics & numerical data *Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Sex Factors Smoking/epidemiology United States
24019356,Small increases to employer premiums could shift millions of people to the exchanges and add billions to federal outlays.,Health Aff (Millwood),Austin DR and Luan A and Wang LL and Bhattacharya J,Missing,"The Affordable Care Act will expand insurance coverage to more than twenty-five million Americans, partly through subsidized private insurance available from newly created health insurance exchanges for people with incomes of 133-400 percent of the federal poverty level. The act will alter the financial incentive structure for employers and influence their decisions on whether or not to offer their employees coverage. These decisions, in turn, will affect federal outlays and revenues through several mechanisms. We model the sensitivity of federal costs for the insurance exchange coverage provision of the Affordable Care Act using the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data set. We assess revenues and subsidy outlays for premiums and cost sharing for individuals purchasing private insurance through exchanges. Our findings show that changing theoretical premium contribution levels by just $100 could induce 2.25 million individuals to transition to exchanges and increase federal outlays by $6.7 billion. Policy makers and analysts should pay especially careful attention to participation rates as the act's implementation continues.","*Cost Sharing Costs and Cost Analysis Financing, Government/economics Health Benefit Plans, Employee/*economics/legislation & jurisprudence Health Insurance Exchanges/*economics/utilization Humans Income Insurance Coverage/*economics Models, Economic Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act/economics/legislation & jurisprudence United States"
24019420,Vitamin D(3)supplementation and childhood diarrhea: a randomized controlled trial.,Pediatrics,Aluisio AR and Maroof Z and Chandramohan D and Bruce J and Mughal MZ and Bhutta Z and Walraven G and Masher MI and Ensink JH and Manaseki-Holland S,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on the incidence and risk for first and recurrent diarrheal illnesses among children in Kabul, Afghanistan. METHODS: This double-blind placebo-controlled trial randomized 3046 high-risk 1- to 11-month-old infants to receive 6 quarterly doses of oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol 100000 IU) or placebo in inner city Kabul. Data on diarrheal episodes (>/= 3 loose/liquid stools in 24 hours) was gathered through active and passive surveillance over 18 months of follow-up. Time to first diarrheal illness was analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier plots. Incidence rates and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated by using recurrent event Poisson regression models. RESULTS: No significant difference existed in survival time to first diarrheal illness (log rank P = .55). The incidences of diarrheal episodes were 3.43 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.28-3.59) and 3.59 per child-year (95% CI, 3.44-3.76) in the placebo and intervention arms, respectively. Vitamin D3 supplementation was found to have no effect on the risk for recurrent diarrheal disease in either intention-to-treat (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.98-1.17; P = .15) or per protocol (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.98-1.12; P = .14) analyses. The lack of preventive benefit remained when the randomized population was stratified by age groups, nutritional status, and seasons. CONCLUSIONS: Quarterly supplementation with vitamin D3 conferred no reduction on time to first illness or on the risk for recurrent diarrheal disease in this study. Similar supplementation to comparable populations is not recommended. Additional research in alternative settings may be helpful in elucidating the role of vitamin D3 supplementation for prevention of diarrheal diseases.","Afghanistan/epidemiology Child, Preschool Cholecalciferol/*therapeutic use Diarrhea/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology Diarrhea, Infantile/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology *Dietary Supplements Double-Blind Method Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Infant Male Risk"
23999612,Maternal posttraumatic stress disorder and depression in pediatric primary care: association with child maltreatment and frequency of child exposure to traumatic events.,JAMA Pediatr,Chemtob CM and Gudino OG and Laraque D,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be associated with increased risk for child maltreatment and child exposure to traumatic events. Exposure to multiple traumatic events is associated with a wide range of adverse health and social outcomes in children. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of probable maternal depression, PTSD, and comorbid PTSD and depression with the risk for child maltreatment and parenting stress and with the number of traumatic events to which preschool children are exposed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational design. We used analysis of variance to determine whether probable maternal psychopathology groups differed on child maltreatment, parenting stress, and children's exposure to traumatic events. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to examine the unique and interactive effects of depression and PTSD severity scores on these outcomes. SETTING: Urban pediatric primary care outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-seven mothers of children aged 3 to 5 years. EXPOSURE: Pediatric primary care visit. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Probable maternal depression and/or PTSD, parenting stress, child exposure to traumatic events, and child maltreatment. RESULTS: Mothers with probable comorbid PTSD and depression reported greater child-directed psychological aggression and physical assault and greater parenting stress. The children of mothers with PTSD (mean number of events the child was exposed to, 5.0) or with comorbid PTSD and depression (3.5 events) experienced more traumatic events than those of mothers with depression (1.2 events) or neither disorder (1.4 events). Severity of depressive symptoms uniquely predicted physical assault and neglect. Symptom scores for PTSD and depression interacted to predict psychological aggression and child exposure to traumatic events. When PTSD symptom severity scores were high, psychological aggression and the number of traumatic events children experienced rose. Depressive symptom severity scores predicted the risk for psychological aggression and exposure to traumatic events only when PTSD symptom severity scores were low. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children of mothers with PTSD are exposed to more traumatic events. Posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with an increased risk for child maltreatment beyond that associated with depression. Screening and intervention for maternal PTSD, in addition to maternal depression, may increase our ability to reduce children's exposure to traumatic stress and maltreatment.","Adult Child Abuse/psychology/*statistics & numerical data Child, Preschool Comorbidity Cross-Sectional Studies Depression/*epidemiology Female Humans Male Mothers/*psychology Primary Health Care Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*epidemiology Stress, Psychological"
23999949,Health care-associated infections: a meta-analysis of costs and financial impact on the US health care system.,JAMA Intern Med,Zimlichman E and Henderson D and Tamir O and Franz C and Song P and Yamin CK and Keohane C and Denham CR and Bates DW,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Health care-associated infections (HAIs) account for a large proportion of the harms caused by health care and are associated with high costs. Better evaluation of the costs of these infections could help providers and payers to justify investing in prevention. OBJECTIVE: To estimate costs associated with the most significant and targetable HAIs. DATA SOURCES: For estimation of attributable costs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed for the years 1986 through April 2013. For HAI incidence estimates, we used the National Healthcare Safety Network of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). STUDY SELECTION: Studies performed outside the United States were excluded. Inclusion criteria included a robust method of comparison using a matched control group or an appropriate regression strategy, generalizable populations typical of inpatient wards and critical care units, methodologic consistency with CDC definitions, and soundness of handling economic outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Three review cycles were completed, with the final iteration carried out from July 2011 to April 2013. Selected publications underwent a secondary review by the research team. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Costs, inflated to 2012 US dollars. RESULTS: Using Monte Carlo simulation, we generated point estimates and 95% CIs for attributable costs and length of hospital stay. On a per-case basis, central line-associated bloodstream infections were found to be the most costly HAIs at $45,814 (95% CI, $30,919-$65,245), followed by ventilator-associated pneumonia at $40,144 (95% CI, $36,286-$44,220), surgical site infections at $20,785 (95% CI, $18,902-$22,667), Clostridium difficile infection at $11,285 (95% CI, $9118-$13,574), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections at $896 (95% CI, $603-$1189). The total annual costs for the 5 major infections were $9.8 billion (95% CI, $8.3-$11.5 billion), with surgical site infections contributing the most to overall costs (33.7% of the total), followed by ventilator-associated pneumonia (31.6%), central line-associated bloodstream infections (18.9%), C difficile infections (15.4%), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (<1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: While quality improvement initiatives have decreased HAI incidence and costs, much more remains to be done. As hospitals realize savings from prevention of these complications under payment reforms, they may be more likely to invest in such strategies.",Adult Cross Infection/*economics/epidemiology/therapy *Health Care Costs Hospitalization/economics Humans Incidence United States/epidemiology

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the positive effects of a group cognitive-behavioral prevention (CBP) program extended to longer-term (multiyear) follow-up. DESIGN: A 4-site randomized clinical trial with 33 months of follow-up was conducted. Recruitment of participants was from August 2003 through February 2006. SETTING: The study settings included a health maintenance organization, university medical centers, and a community mental health center. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred sixteen adolescent (aged 13-17 years) offspring of parents with current and/or prior depressive disorders; adolescents had histories of depression, current elevated depressive symptoms, or both but did not currently meet criteria for a depressive disorder. INTERVENTIONS: The CBP program consisted of 8 weekly 90-minute group sessions followed by 6 monthly continuation sessions. Adolescents were randomly assigned to either the CBP program or usual care (UC). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a probable or definite episode of depression (Depression Symptom Rating score >/=4) for at least 2 weeks through the month 33 follow-up evaluation. RESULTS: Over the 33-month follow-up period, youths in the CBP condition had significantly fewer onsets of depressive episodes compared with those in UC. Parental depression at baseline significantly moderated the intervention effect. When parents were not depressed at intake, CBP was superior to UC (number needed to treat, 6), whereas when parents were actively depressed at baseline, average onset rates between CBP and UC were not significantly different. A 3-way interaction among intervention, baseline parental depression, and site indicated that the impact of parental depression on intervention effectiveness varied across sites. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The CBP program showed significant sustained effects compared with UC in preventing the onset of depressive episodes in at-risk youth over a nearly 3-year period. Important next steps will be to strengthen the CBP intervention to further enhance its preventive effects, improve intervention outcomes when parents are currently depressed, and conduct larger implementation trials to test the broader public health impact of the CBP program for preventing depression in youth.

24026850,Exercise for depression.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Cooney GM and Dwan K and Greig CA and Lawlor DA and Rimer J and Waugh FR and McMurdo M and Mead GE,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Depression is a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Depression is commonly treated with antidepressants and/or psychological therapy, but some people may prefer alternative approaches such as exercise. There are a number of theoretical reasons why exercise may improve depression. This is an update of an earlier review first published in 2009. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of depression in adults compared with no treatment or a comparator intervention. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) to 13 July 2012. This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years); MEDLINE (1950 to date); EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also searched www.controlled-trials.com, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. No date or language restrictions were applied to the search.We conducted an additional search of the CCDANCTR up to 1st March 2013 and any potentially eligible trials not already included are listed as 'awaiting classification.' SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials in which exercise (defined according to American College of Sports Medicine criteria) was compared to standard treatment, no treatment or a placebo treatment, pharmacological treatment, psychological treatment or other active treatment in adults (aged 18 and over) with depression, as defined by trial authors. We included cluster trials and those that randomised individuals. We excluded trials of postnatal depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors extracted data on primary and secondary outcomes at the end of the trial and end of follow-up (if available). We calculated effect sizes for each trial using Hedges' g method and a standardised mean difference (SMD) for the overall pooled effect, using a random-effects model risk ratio for dichotomous data. Where trials used a number of different tools to assess depression, we included the main outcome measure only in the meta-analysis. Where trials provided several 'doses' of exercise, we used data from the biggest 'dose' of exercise, and performed sensitivity analyses using the lower 'dose'. We performed subgroup analyses to explore the influence of method of diagnosis of depression (diagnostic interview or cut-off point on scale), intensity of exercise and the number of sessions of exercise on effect sizes. Two authors performed the 'Risk of bias' assessments. Our sensitivity analyses explored the influence of study quality on outcome. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-nine trials (2326 participants) fulfilled our inclusion criteria, of which 37 provided data for meta-analyses. There were multiple sources of bias in many of the trials; randomisation was adequately concealed in 14 studies, 15 used intention-to-treat analyses and 12 used blinded outcome assessors.For the 35 trials (1356 participants) comparing exercise with no treatment or a control intervention, the pooled SMD for the primary outcome of depression at the end of treatment was -0.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.81 to -0.42), indicating a moderate clinical effect. There was moderate heterogeneity (I(2) = 63%).When we included only the six trials (464 participants) with adequate allocation concealment, intention-to-treat analysis and blinded outcome assessment, the pooled SMD for this outcome was not statistically significant (-0.18, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.11). Pooled data from the eight trials (377 participants) providing long-term follow-up data on mood found a small effect in favour of exercise (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.03).Twenty-nine trials reported acceptability of treatment, three trials reported quality of life, none reported cost, and six reported adverse events.For acceptability of treatment (assessed by number of drop-outs during the intervention), the risk ratio was 1.00 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.04).Seven trials compared exercise with psychological therapy (189 participants), and found no significant difference (SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.26). Four trials (n = 300) compared exercise with pharmacological treatment and found no significant difference (SMD -0.11, -0.34, 0.12). One trial (n = 18) reported that exercise was more effective than bright light therapy (MD -6.40, 95% CI -10.20 to -2.60).For each trial that was included, two authors independently assessed for sources of bias in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration 'Risk of bias' tool. In exercise trials, there are inherent difficulties in blinding both those receiving the intervention and those delivering the intervention. Many trials used participant self-report rating scales as a method for post-intervention analysis, which also has the potential to bias findings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Exercise is moderately more effective than a control intervention for reducing symptoms of depression, but analysis of methodologically robust trials only shows a smaller effect in favour of exercise. When compared to psychological or pharmacological therapies, exercise appears to be no more effective, though this conclusion is based on a few small trials.",Adult Depression/*therapy Exercise/*psychology Humans Middle Aged Psychotherapy Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Treatment Outcome Young Adult
24030074,Leukaemia in young children in the vicinity of British nuclear power plants: a case-control study.,Br J Cancer,Bithell JF and Murphy MF and Stiller CA and Toumpakari E and Vincent T and Wakeford R,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Concern about the risk of leukaemia in children living near nuclear power plants (NPPs) persists. Previous British analyses have been area based and consequently thought to be less effective than case-control studies. METHODS: Cases of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (LNHL) born and diagnosed in Great Britain between 1962 and 2007, with matched cancer-free controls, were analysed by logistic regression to estimate the risk of residential proximity at birth and diagnosis to the nearest NPP, adjusting for relevant variables. RESULTS: For 9821 children with LNHL under the age of 5 years, the estimated extra risk associated with residential proximity to an NPP at birth was negative-interpolated Odds Ratio (OR) at 5 km was 0.86 (0.49-1.52). The comparison of 10 618 children with LNHL under five with 16 760 similarly aged children with other cancers also gave a negative estimate of the extra risk of residential proximity at diagnosis-interpolated OR at 5 km was 0.86 (0.62-1.18). CONCLUSION: Our results show little evidence of an increase in risk of LNHL to children aged under 5 years from living in the vicinity of an NPP. Risk estimates are incompatible with comparable ones published in a recent German case-control study.","Adolescent Age of Onset Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Great Britain/epidemiology Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/etiology Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology *Nuclear Power Plants/statistics & numerical data *Residence Characteristics/statistics & numerical data Risk Factors"

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether maternal exposure to topical corticosteroids results in adverse pregnancy outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: United Kingdom National Health Service. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2658 pregnant women exposed to topical corticosteroid and 7246 unexposed pregnant women. EXPOSURE: Topical corticosteroids dispensed during pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Orofacial cleft, low birth weight, preterm delivery, fetal death, low Apgar score, and mode of delivery. RESULTS: No associations of maternal topical corticosteroid exposure with orofacial cleft, low birth weight, preterm delivery, fetal death, low Apgar score, and mode of delivery were found in the primary analysis (adjusted risk ratio [RR], 1.85 [95% CI, 0.22-15.20] [P = .57]; 0.97 [95% CI, 0.78-1.19] [P = .75]; 1.20 [95% CI, 0.73-1.96] [P = .48]; 1.07 [95% CI, 0.56-2.05] [P = .84]; 0.84 [95% CI, 0.54-1.31] [P = .45]; and P = .76, respectively). Stratified analyses based on potency did not reveal any significant associations in most of these categories either, but an exploratory analysis showed a significantly increased risk of low birth weight when the dispensed amount of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids exceeded 300 g during the entire pregnancy (adjusted RR, 7.74 [95% CI, 1.49-40.11]; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study reassuringly showed no associations of maternal topical corticosteroid exposure with orofacial cleft, preterm delivery, fetal death, low Apgar score, and mode of delivery. With this study and all available evidence taken together, the risk of low birth weight seems to correlate with the quantity of topical corticosteroid exposure.","Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/diagnosis/*etiology Administration, Topical Apgar Score Birth Weight Cohort Studies Dermatologic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Female Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Great Britain Humans Infant, Low Birth Weight Infant, Newborn Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications/*chemically induced *Pregnancy Outcome Retrospective Studies Skin Cream Skin Diseases/drug therapy"
24005847,Trends in sunscreen recommendation among US physicians.,JAMA Dermatol,Akamine KL and Gustafson CJ and Davis SA and Levender MM and Feldman SR,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Sunscreen is an important part of sun protection to prevent skin cancer but may not be recommended as often as guidelines dictate. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate trends in sunscreen recommendation among physicians to determine whether they are following suggested patient-education guidelines regarding sun protection, and to assess data regarding physician sunscreen recommendations to determine the association with patient demographics, physician specialty, and physician diagnosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey was queried to identify patient visits to nonfederal outpatient physician offices at US ambulatory care practices (January 1, 1989-December 26, 2010) during which sunscreen was recommended. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Frequency of sunscreen recommendation. RESULTS: According to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, there were an estimated 18.30 billion patient visits nationwide. Physicians mentioned sunscreen at approximately 12.83 million visits (0.07%). Mention of sunscreen was reported by physicians at 0.9% of patient visits associated with a diagnosis of skin disease. Dermatologists recorded the mention of sunscreen the most (86.4% of all visits associated with sunscreen). However, dermatologists reported mentioning sunscreen at only 1.6% of all dermatology visits. Sunscreen was mentioned most frequently to white patients, particularly those in their eighth decade of life, and least frequently to children. Actinic keratosis was the most common diagnosis associated with sunscreen recommendation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite encouragement to provide patient education regarding sunscreen use and sun-protective behaviors, the rate at which physicians are mentioning sunscreen at patient visits is quite low, even for patients with a history of skin cancer. The high incidence and morbidity of skin cancer can be greatly reduced with the implementation of sun-protective behaviors, which patients should be counseled about at outpatient visits.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Child Child, Preschool Continental Population Groups/statistics & numerical data Female Health Care Surveys Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Patient Education as Topic/methods Physician's Practice Patterns/*statistics & numerical data Physicians/*statistics & numerical data *Practice Guidelines as Topic Sex Factors Skin Neoplasms/*prevention & control Sunscreening Agents/*administration & dosage United States Young Adult"

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between undervaccination and pertussis in children 3 to 36 months of age. DESIGN: Matched case-control study with conditional logistic regression analysis. SETTING: Eight managed care organizations of the Vaccine Safety Datalink between 2004 and 2010. PARTICIPANTS: Each laboratory-confirmed case of pertussis (72 patients) was matched to 4 randomly selected controls (for a total of 288 controls). The case patients were matched to controls by managed care organization site, sex, and age at the index date. The index date was defined as the date of pertussis diagnosis for the case patients. EXPOSURE: Undervaccination for the diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. Undervaccination was defined as the number of doses of DTaP vaccine that was either missing or delayed by the index date. Case patients and controls could be undervaccinated by 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 doses of DTaP vaccine. Children undervaccinated by 0 doses were considered age-appropriately vaccinated by the index date. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Pertussis. RESULTS: Of the 72 case patients with pertussis, 12 (16.67%) were hospitalized, and 34 (47.22%) were undervaccinated for DTaP vaccine by the date of pertussis diagnosis. Of the 288 matched controls, 64 (22.22%) were undervaccinated for DTaP vaccine. Undervaccination was strongly associated with pertussis.

24091890,Family caregiving and all-cause mortality: findings from a population-based propensity-matched analysis.,Am J Epidemiol,Roth DL and Haley WE and Hovater M and Perkins M and Wadley VG and Judd S,Missing,"Previous studies have provided conflicting evidence on whether being a family caregiver is associated with increased or decreased risk for all-cause mortality. This study examined whether 3,503 family caregivers enrolled in the national Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study showed differences in all-cause mortality from 2003 to 2012 compared with a propensity-matched sample of noncaregivers. Caregivers were individually matched with 3,503 noncaregivers by using a propensity score matching procedure based on 15 demographic, health history, and health behavior covariates. During an average 6-year follow-up period, 264 (7.5%) of the caregivers died, which was significantly fewer than the 315 (9.0%) matched noncaregivers who died during the same period. A proportional hazards model indicated that caregivers had an 18% reduced rate of death compared with noncaregivers (hazard ratio = 0.823, 95% confidence interval: 0.699, 0.969). Subgroup analyses by race, sex, caregiving relationship, and caregiving strain failed to identify any subgroups with increased rates of death compared with matched noncaregivers. Public policy and discourse should recognize that providing care to a family member with a chronic illness or disability is not associated with increased risk of death in most cases, but may instead be associated with modest survival benefits for the caregivers.",Age Factors Aged Caregivers/*statistics & numerical data *Family Humans Middle Aged Mortality/*trends Sex Factors Socioeconomic Factors
24144704,Psychotropic medication use and polypharmacy in children with autism spectrum disorders.,Pediatrics,Spencer D and Marshall J and Post B and Kulakodlu M and Newschaffer C and Dennen T and Azocar F and Jain A,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to examine rates and predictors of psychotropic use and multiclass polypharmacy among commercially insured children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). METHODS: This retrospective observational study used administrative medical and pharmacy claims data linked with health plan enrollment and sociodemographic information from 2001 to 2009. Children with ASD were identified by using a validated ASD case algorithm. Psychotropic polypharmacy was defined as concurrent medication fills across >/= 2 classes for at least 30 days. Multinomial logistic regression was used to model 5 categories of psychotropic use and multiclass polypharmacy. RESULTS: Among 33,565 children with ASD, 64% had a filled prescription for at least 1 psychotropic medication, 35% had evidence of psychotropic polypharmacy (>/= 2 classes), and 15% used medications from >/= 3 classes concurrently. Among children with polypharmacy, the median length of polypharmacy was 346 days. Older children, those who had a psychiatrist visit, and those with evidence of co-occurring conditions (seizures, attention-deficit disorders, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or depression) had higher odds of psychotropic use and/or polypharmacy. CONCLUSIONS: Despite minimal evidence of the effectiveness or appropriateness of multidrug treatment of ASD, psychotropic medications are commonly used, singly and in combination, for ASD and its co-occurring conditions. Our results indicate the need to develop standards of care around the prescription of psychotropic medications to children with ASD.","Adolescent Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*psychology Child, Preschool Female Humans Infant Male *Polypharmacy Psychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use Retrospective Studies Young Adult"
24129257,"Origin, evolution, and genotyping of emergent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains in the United States.",MBio,Huang YW and Dickerman AW and Pineyro P and Li L and Fang L and Kiehne R and Opriessnig T and Meng XJ,Missing,"Coronaviruses are known to infect humans and other animals and cause respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. Here we report the emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in the United States and determination of its origin, evolution, and genotypes based on temporal and geographical evidence. Histological lesions in small intestine sections of affected pigs and the complete genomic sequences of three emergent strains of PEDV isolated from outbreaks in Minnesota and Iowa were characterized. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the three U.S. strains revealed a close relationship with Chinese PEDV strains and their likely Chinese origin. The U.S. PEDV strains underwent evolutionary divergence, which can be classified into two sublineages. The three emergent U.S. strains are most closely related to a strain isolated in 2012 from Anhui Province in China, which might be the result of multiple recombination events between different genetic lineages or sublineages of PEDV. Molecular clock analysis of the divergent time based on the complete genomic sequences is consistent with the actual time difference, approximately 2 to 3 years, of the PED outbreaks between China (December 2010) and the United States (May 2013). The finding that the emergent U.S. PEDV strains share unique genetic features at the 5'-untranslated region with a bat coronavirus provided further support of the evolutionary origin of PEDV from bats and potential cross-species transmission. The data from this study have important implications for understanding the ongoing PEDV outbreaks in the United States and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures against PEDV. IMPORTANCE: The sudden emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a coronavirus, for the first time in the United States causes significant economic and public health concerns. Since its recognition in May 2013, PEDV has rapidly spread across the United States, resulting in high mortality in piglets in more than 17 States now. The ongoing outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in humans from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula and the historical deadly nature of the 2002 outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus create further anxiety over the emergence of PEDV in the United States due to the lack of scientific information about the origin and evolution of this emerging coronavirus. Here we report the detailed genetic characterization, origin, and evolution of emergent PEDV strains in the United States. The results provide much needed information to devise effective preventive and control strategies against PEDV in the United States.","Animals China/epidemiology Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary/virology *Evolution, Molecular Genotype Molecular Sequence Data Phylogeny Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus/classification/*genetics/*isolation & purification Swine Swine Diseases/epidemiology/*virology United States/epidemiology"
24108403,"Barefoot running: an evaluation of current hypothesis, future research and clinical applications.",Br J Sports Med,Tam N and Astephen Wilson JL and Noakes TD and Tucker R,Missing,"Barefoot running has become a popular research topic, driven by the increasing prescription of barefoot running as a means of reducing injury risk. Proponents of barefoot running cite evolutionary theories that long-distance running ability was crucial for human survival, and proof of the benefits of natural running. Subsequently, runners have been advised to run barefoot as a treatment mode for injuries, strength and conditioning. The body of literature examining the mechanical, structural, clinical and performance implications of barefoot running is still in its infancy. Recent research has found significant differences associated with barefoot running relative to shod running, and these differences have been associated with factors that are thought to contribute to injury and performance. Crucially, long-term prospective studies have yet to be conducted and the link between barefoot running and injury or performance remains tenuous and speculative. The injury prevention potential of barefoot running is further complicated by the complexity of injury aetiology, with no single factor having been identified as causative for the most common running injuries. The aim of the present review was to critically evaluate the theory and evidence for barefoot running, drawing on both collected evidence as well as literature that have been used to argue in favour of barefoot running. We describe the factors driving the prescription of barefoot running, examine which of these factors may have merit, what the collected evidence suggests about the suitability of barefoot running for its purported uses and describe the necessary future research to confirm or refute the barefoot running hypotheses.",Missing

DESIGN: Register based cohort study. SETTING: Denmark and Sweden, October 2006 to December 2010. PARTICIPANTS: 997,585 girls aged 10-17, among whom 296,826 received a total of 696,420 qHPV vaccine doses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident hospital diagnosed autoimmune, neurological, and venous thromboembolic events (53 different outcomes) up to 180 days after each qHPV vaccine dose. Only events with at least five vaccine exposed cases were considered for further assessment. Rate ratios adjusted for age, country, calendar year, and parental country of birth, education, and socioeconomic status were estimated, comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated person time. For outcomes where the rate ratio was significantly increased, we regarded three criteria as signal strengthening: analysis based on 20 or more vaccine exposed cases (reliability), rate ratio 3.0 or more (strength), and significantly increased rate ratio in country specific analyses (consistency). We additionally assessed clustering of events in time and estimated rate ratios for a risk period that started on day 181. RESULTS: Among the 53 outcomes, at least five vaccine exposed cases occurred in 29 and these were analysed further. Whereas the rate ratios for 20 of 23 autoimmune events were not significantly increased, exposure to qHPV vaccine was significantly associated with Behcet's syndrome, Raynaud's disease, and type 1 diabetes. Each of these three outcomes fulfilled only one of three predefined signal strengthening criteria. Furthermore, the pattern of distribution in time after vaccination was random for all three and the rate ratios for these outcomes in the period from day 181 after vaccination were similar to the rate ratios in the primary risk period. The rate ratios for five neurological events were not significantly increased and there were inverse associations with epilepsy (rate ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.80) and paralysis (0.56, 0.35 to 0.90). There was no association between exposure to qHPV vaccine and venous thromboembolism (0.86, 0.55 to 1.36). CONCLUSIONS: This large cohort study found no evidence supporting associations between exposure to qHPV vaccine and autoimmune, neurological, and venous thromboembolic adverse events. Although associations for three autoimmune events were initially observed, on further assessment these were weak and not temporally related to vaccine exposure. Furthermore, the findings need to be interpreted considering the multiple outcomes assessed.",Adolescent Autoimmune Diseases/*epidemiology/immunology Child Cohort Studies Denmark/epidemiology Female Humans Incidence Nervous System Diseases/*epidemiology/immunology Papillomavirus Infections/*prevention & control Papillomavirus Vaccines/*adverse effects Risk Factors Sweden/epidemiology Venous Thromboembolism/*epidemiology/immunology

The Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) routinely requests CSRs from manufacturers for its drug assessments. Our objective was to determine the information gain from CSRs compared to publicly available sources (journal publications and registry reports) for patient-relevant outcomes included in IQWiG health technology assessments (HTAs) of drugs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a sample of 101 trials with full CSRs received for 16 HTAs of drugs completed by IQWiG between 15 January 2006 and 14 February 2011, and analyzed the CSRs and the publicly available sources of these trials. For each document type we assessed the completeness of information on all patient-relevant outcomes included in the HTAs (benefit outcomes, e.g., mortality, symptoms, and health-related quality of life; harm outcomes, e.g., adverse events). We dichotomized the outcomes as ""completely reported"" or ""incompletely reported."" For each document type, we calculated the proportion of outcomes with complete information per outcome category and overall. We analyzed 101 trials with CSRs; 86 had at least one publicly available source, 65 at least one journal publication, and 50 a registry report. The trials included 1,080 patient-relevant outcomes. The CSRs provided complete information on a considerably higher proportion of outcomes (86%) than the combined publicly available sources (39%). With the exception of health-related quality of life (57%), CSRs provided complete information on 78% to 100% of the various benefit outcomes (combined publicly available sources: 20% to 53%). CSRs also provided considerably more information on harms. The differences in completeness of information for patient-relevant outcomes between CSRs and journal publications or registry reports (or a combination of both) were statistically significant for all types of outcomes. The main limitation of our study is that our sample is not representative because only CSRs provided voluntarily by pharmaceutical companies upon request could be assessed. In addition, the sample covered only a limited number of therapeutic areas and was restricted to randomized controlled trials investigating drugs. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to CSRs, publicly available sources provide insufficient information on patient-relevant outcomes of clinical trials. CSRs should therefore be made publicly available.

24153444,Higher glucose levels associated with lower memory and reduced hippocampal microstructure.,Neurology,Kerti L and Witte AV and Winkler A and Grittner U and Rujescu D and Floel A,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: For this cross-sectional study, we aimed to elucidate whether higher glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and glucose levels exert a negative impact on memory performance and hippocampal volume and microstructure in a cohort of healthy, older, nondiabetic individuals without dementia. METHODS: In 141 individuals (72 women, mean age 63.1 years +/- 6.9 SD), memory was tested using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Peripheral levels of fasting HbA1c, glucose, and insulin and 3-tesla MRI scans were acquired to assess hippocampal volume and microstructure, as indicated by gray matter barrier density. Linear regression and simple mediation models were calculated to examine associations among memory, glucose metabolism, and hippocampal parameters. RESULTS: Lower HbA1c and glucose levels were significantly associated with better scores in delayed recall, learning ability, and memory consolidation. In multiple regression models, HbA1c remained strongly associated with memory performance. Moreover, mediation analyses indicated that beneficial effects of lower HbA1c on memory are in part mediated by hippocampal volume and microstructure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that even in the absence of manifest type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance, chronically higher blood glucose levels exert a negative influence on cognition, possibly mediated by structural changes in learning-relevant brain areas. Therefore, strategies aimed at lowering glucose levels even in the normal range may beneficially influence cognition in the older population, a hypothesis to be examined in future interventional trials.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Analysis of Variance Apolipoproteins E/genetics *Blood Glucose Fasting/blood Female Genotype Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated/metabolism Hippocampus/*pathology Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Memory Disorders/*blood/*pathology Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Regression Analysis"

METHODS: Transform-Us! is a clustered randomised school-based intervention with four groups: sedentary behaviour intervention (SB-I), PA intervention (PA-I), combined PA+SB-I and control group. All children in grade 3 from 20 participating primary schools in Melbourne, Australia were eligible to complete annual evaluation assessments. The outcomes were the proportion of time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and light PA (LPA) during recess and lunchtime assessed by accelerometers. Potential mediators included: perceived social support from teachers; perceived availability of line markings; perceived accessibility of sports equipment; and perceived school play environment. Generalised linear models were used and mediation effects were estimated by product-of-coefficients (a.b) approach. RESULTS: 268 children (8.2 years, 57% girls at baseline) provided complete data at both time points. A significant intervention effect on MVPA during recess in the SB-I and PA-I groups compared with the control group (proportional difference in MVPA time; 38% (95% CI 21% to 57%) and 40% (95% CI 20% to 62%), respectively) was found. The perceived school play environment was significantly positively associated with MVPA at recess among girls. An increase in perceived social support from teachers suppressed the PA+SB-I effect on light PA during recess (a.b= -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.00). No significant mediating effects on PA during recess and lunchtime were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A positive perception of the school play environment was associated with higher MVPA during recess among girls.

Study 2 showed that the effect was selective to older adults: Younger adults' subjective age was not affected by participating in the memory experiment. Study 3 showed that the subjective-aging effect was specific to memory, as taking a vocabulary test for a similar amount of time did not affect older adults' subjective age.

A systematic review was performed in the databases PubMed, Scientific Electronic Library Online, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences, and Cochrane and 36 cross-sectional studies were identified with quantitative results about the use of psychoactive substances by truck drivers. Out of these, 28 were carried out in countries with large land areas and 23 obtained their information through self-reporting. The most frequently studied substances were alcohol (n=25), amphetamines (n=17), marijuana (n=16) and cocaine (n=13). The prevalence of the use of these substances greatly varied: alcohol (0.1-91.0%); amphetamines (0.2-82.5%), marijuana (0.2-29.9%), cocaine (0.1-8.3%). The frequency of substance use was lower in studies that investigated the presence of these substances in biological samples than in those based on self-reported use. In 12 studies that evaluated factors associated with the intake of psychoactive substances, the following stood out: younger age, higher income, longer trips, alcohol consumption, driving in the night shift, travelling interstate routes, long or short sleep, fewer hours of rest, little experience of the driver, connection with small and medium sized companies, income below levels determined by labour agreements, productivity-based earnings and prior involvement in accidents. The frequency of psychoactive substance use by truck drivers seems to be high, although that greatly varies according to the type of substance and the method of collecting the information.

Those in hospital care have been less often investigated. Following a pilot trial suggesting efficacy we carried out a randomised study in hospital medical clinics. METHODS: We undertook a multicentre, randomised trial on health anxious patients attending cardiac, endocrine, gastroenterological, neurological, and respiratory medicine clinics in secondary care. We included those aged 16-75 years, who satisfied the criteria for excessive health anxiety, and were resident in the area covered by the hospital, were not under investigation for new pathology or too medically unwell to take part. We used a computer-generated random scheme to allocate eligible medical patients to an active treatment group of five-to-ten sessions of adapted cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT-HA group) delivered by hospital-based therapists or to standard care in the clinics. The primary outcome was change in health anxiety symptoms measured by the Health Anxiety Inventory at 1 year and the main secondary hypothesis was equivalence of total health and social care costs over 2 years, with an equivalence margin of pound150. Analysis was by intention to treat. The study is registered with controlled-trials.com, ISRCTN14565822. FINDINGS: Of 28,991 patients screened, 444 were randomly assigned to receive either adapted cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT-HA group, 219 participants) or standard care (standard care group, 225), with 205 participants in the CBT-HA group and 212 in the standard care group included in the analyses of the primary endpoints. At 1 year, improvement in health anxiety in the patients in the CBT-HA group was 2.98 points greater than in those in the standard care group (95% CI 1.64-4.33, p<0.0001), and twice as many patients receiving cognitive behaviour therapy achieved normal levels of health anxiety compared with those in the control group (13.9% vs 7.3%; odds ratio 2.15, 95% CI 1.09-4.23, p=0.0273). Similar differences were observed at 6 months and 2 years, and there were concomitant reductions in generalised anxiety and, to a lesser extent, depression. Of nine deaths, six were in the control group; all were due to pre-existing illness. Social functioning or health-related quality of life did not differ significantly between groups. Equivalence in total 2-year costs was not achieved, but the difference was not significant (adjusted mean difference pound156, 95% CI -1446 to 1758, p=0.848).

Despite these data, almost half of older adults (older than 50 years) continue to use these supplements. Bone mineral density can be used to detect biologically significant effects in much smaller cohorts. We investigated whether vitamin D supplementation affects bone mineral density. METHODS: We searched Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Database, from inception to July 8, 2012, for trials assessing the effects of vitamin D (D3 or D2, but not vitamin D metabolites) on bone mineral density. We included all randomised trials comparing interventions that differed only in vitamin D content, and which included adults (average age >20 years) without other metabolic bone diseases. We pooled data with a random effects meta-analysis with weighted mean differences and 95% CIs reported. To assess heterogeneity in results of individual studies, we used Cochran's Q statistic and the I(2) statistic. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in bone mineral density from baseline. FINDINGS: Of 3930 citations identified by the search strategy, 23 studies (mean duration 23.5 months, comprising 4082 participants, 92% women, average age 59 years) met the inclusion criteria. 19 studies had mainly white populations. Mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was less than 50 nmol/L in eight studies (n=1791). In ten studies (n=2294), individuals were given vitamin D doses less than 800 IU per day. Bone mineral density was measured at one to five sites (lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, trochanter, total body, or forearm) in each study, so 70 tests of statistical significance were done across the studies. There were six findings of significant benefit, two of significant detriment, and the rest were non-significant. Only one study showed benefit at more than one site. Results of our meta-analysis showed a small benefit at the femoral neck (weighted mean difference 0.8%, 95% CI 0.2-1.4) with heterogeneity among trials (I(2)=67%, p<0.00027). No effect at any other site was reported, including the total hip. We recorded a bias toward positive results at the femoral neck and total hip.

Unfortunately, because most children and adolescents look physically normal after a concussion, school officials often fail to recognize the need for academic or environmental adjustments. Appropriate guidance and recommendations from the pediatrician may ease the transition back to the school environment and facilitate the recovery of the child or adolescent.

We describe the epidemiology of influenza-associated pediatric deaths from the 2004-2005 through the 2011-2012 influenza seasons. METHODS: Deaths in children <18 years of age with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by using a standard case report form to collect data on demographic characteristics, medical conditions, clinical course, and laboratory results. Characteristics of children with no high-risk medical conditions were compared with those of children with high-risk medical conditions. RESULTS: From October 2004 through September 2012, 830 pediatric influenza-associated deaths were reported. The median age was 7 years (interquartile range: 1-12 years). Thirty-five percent of children died before hospital admission. Of 794 children with a known medical history, 43% had no high-risk medical conditions, 33% had neurologic disorders, and 12% had genetic or chromosomal disorders. Children without high-risk medical conditions were more likely to die before hospital admission (relative risk: 1.9; 95% confidence interval: 1.6-2.4) and within 3 days of symptom onset (relative risk: 1.6; 95% confidence interval: 1.3-2.0) than those with high-risk medical conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza can be fatal in children with and without high-risk medical conditions. These findings highlight the importance of recommendations that all children should receive annual influenza vaccination to prevent influenza, and children who are hospitalized, who have severe illness, or who are at high risk of complications (age <2 years or with medical conditions) should receive antiviral treatment as early as possible.","Child Child, Preschool Female Hospitalization/trends Humans Infant Influenza, Human/*diagnosis/*mortality Male Mortality/*trends *Population Surveillance/methods United States/epidemiology"

STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study examines the validity of slow-onset and fast-onset ACS presentations and their influence on ACS prehospital delay times. A fast-onset ACS presentation is characterized by sudden, continuous, and severe chest pain, and slow-onset ACS pertains to all other ACS presentations. METHODS: Baseline data pertaining to medical profiles, prehospital delay times, and ACS symptoms were recorded for all ACS patients who participated in a large multisite randomized control trial (RCT) in Dublin, Ireland. Patients were interviewed 2-4 days after their ACS event, and data were gathered using the ACS Response to Symptom Index. RESULTS: Only baseline data from the RCT, N = 893 patients, were analyzed. A total of 65% (n = 577) of patients experienced slow-onset ACS presentation, whereas 35% (n = 316) experienced fast-onset ACS. Patients who experienced slow-onset ACS were significantly more likely to have longer prehospital delays than patients with fast-onset ACS (3.5 h vs. 2.0 h, respectively, t = -5.63, df 890, p < 0.001). A multivariate analysis of delay revealed that, in the presence of other known delay factors, the only independent predictors of delay were slow-onset and fast-onset ACS (beta = -.096, p < 0.002) and other factors associated with patient behavior. CONCLUSION: Slow-onset ACS and fast-onset ACS presentations are associated with distinct behavioral patterns that significantly influence prehospital time frames. As such, slow-onset ACS and fast-onset ACS are legitimate ACS presentation phenomena that should be seriously considered when examining the factors associated with prehospital delay.",Missing

In the major Chinese cities of Shanghai, Hangzhou, Huzhou, and Nanjing--where most human cases of infection have occurred--live poultry markets (LPMs) were closed in April, 2013, soon after the initial outbreak, as a precautionary public health measure. Our objective was to quantify the effect of LPM closure in these cities on poultry-to-person transmission of avian influenza A H7N9 virus. METHODS: We obtained information about every laboratory-confirmed human case of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection reported in the four cities by June 7, 2013, from a database built by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We used data for age, sex, location, residence type (rural or urban area), and dates of illness onset. We obtained information about LPMs from official sources. We constructed a statistical model to explain the patterns in incidence of cases reported in each city on the basis of the assumption of a constant force of infection before LPM closure, and a different constant force of infection after closure. We fitted the model with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. FINDINGS: 85 human cases of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection were reported in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Huzhou, and Nanjing by June 7, 2013, of which 60 were included in our main analysis. Closure of LPMs reduced the mean daily number of infections by 99% (95% credibility interval 93-100%) in Shanghai, by 99% (92-100%) in Hangzhou, by 97% (68-100%) in Huzhou, and by 97% (81-100%) in Nanjing. Because LPMs were the predominant source of exposure to avian influenza A H7N9 virus for confirmed cases in these cities, we estimated that the mean incubation period was 3.3 days (1.4-5.7). INTERPRETATION: LPM closures were effective in the control of human risk of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection in the spring of 2013. In the short term, LPM closure should be rapidly implemented in areas where the virus is identified in live poultry or people. In the long term, evidence-based discussions and deliberations about the role of market rest days and central slaughtering of all live poultry should be renewed.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis based on a random effects model. DATA SOURCES: Searches of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from their inception to December 2012 regardless of language or publication status. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials with >/= 6 months of follow-up that included individuals with a body mass index >/= 30, compared current bariatric surgery techniques with non-surgical treatment, and reported on body weight, cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life, or adverse events. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 11 studies with 796 individuals (range of mean body mass index at baseline 30-52). Individuals allocated to bariatric surgery lost more body weight (mean difference -26 kg (95% confidence interval -31 to -21)) compared with non-surgical treatment, had a higher remission rate of type 2 diabetes (relative risk 22.1 (3.2 to 154.3) in a complete case analysis; 5.3 (1.8 to 15.8) in a conservative analysis assuming diabetes remission in all non-surgically treated individuals with missing data) and metabolic syndrome (relative risk 2.4 (1.6 to 3.6) in complete case analysis; 1.5 (0.9 to 2.3) in conservative analysis), greater improvements in quality of life and reductions in medicine use (no pooled data). Plasma triglyceride concentrations decreased more (mean difference -0.7 mmol/L (-1.0 to -0.4) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations increased more (mean difference 0.21 mmol/L (0.1 to 0.3)). Changes in blood pressure and total or low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were not significantly different. There were no cardiovascular events or deaths reported after bariatric surgery. The most common adverse events after bariatric surgery were iron deficiency anaemia (15% of individuals undergoing malabsorptive bariatric surgery) and reoperations (8%). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with non-surgical treatment of obesity, bariatric surgery leads to greater body weight loss and higher remission rates of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. However, results are limited to two years of follow-up and based on a small number of studies and individuals.

We assessed the effect of maternal exposure to low concentrations of ambient air pollution on birthweight. METHODS: We pooled data from 14 population-based mother-child cohort studies in 12 European countries. Overall, the study population included 74 178 women who had singleton deliveries between Feb 11, 1994, and June 2, 2011, and for whom information about infant birthweight, gestational age, and sex was available. The primary outcome of interest was low birthweight at term (weight <2500 g at birth after 37 weeks of gestation). Mean concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 mum (PM2.5), less than 10 mum (PM10), and between 2.5 mum and 10 mum during pregnancy were estimated at maternal home addresses with temporally adjusted land-use regression models, as was PM2.5 absorbance and concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrogen oxides. We also investigated traffic density on the nearest road and total traffic load. We calculated pooled effect estimates with random-effects models. FINDINGS: A 5 mug/m(3) increase in concentration of PM2.5 during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of low birthweight at term (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.33). An increased risk was also recorded for pregnancy concentrations lower than the present European Union annual PM2.5 limit of 25 mug/m(3) (OR for 5 mug/m(3) increase in participants exposed to concentrations of less than 20 mug/m(3) 1.41, 95% CI 1.20-1.65). PM10 (OR for 10 mug/m(3) increase 1.16, 95% CI 1.00-1.35), NO2 (OR for 10 mug/m(3) increase 1.09, 1.00-1.19), and traffic density on nearest street (OR for increase of 5000 vehicles per day 1.06, 1.01-1.11) were also associated with increased risk of low birthweight at term. The population attributable risk estimated for a reduction in PM2.5 concentration to 10 mug/m(3) during pregnancy corresponded to a decrease of 22% (95% CI 8-33%) in cases of low birthweight at term. INTERPRETATION: Exposure to ambient air pollutants and traffic during pregnancy is associated with restricted fetal growth. A substantial proportion of cases of low birthweight at term could be prevented in Europe if urban air pollution was reduced.

Animal work identified that patients with peripheral artery disease may particularly benefit from dietary supplementation with flaxseed. Hypertension is commonly associated with peripheral artery disease. The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of daily ingestion of flaxseed on systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in peripheral artery disease patients. In this prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, patients (110 in total) ingested a variety of foods that contained 30 g of milled flaxseed or placebo each day over 6 months. Plasma levels of the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid and enterolignans increased 2- to 50-fold in the flaxseed-fed group but did not increase significantly in the placebo group. Patient body weights were not significantly different between the 2 groups at any time. SBP was approximately 10 mm Hg lower, and DBP was approximately 7 mm Hg lower in the flaxseed group compared with placebo after 6 months. Patients who entered the trial with a SBP >/= 140 mm Hg at baseline obtained a significant reduction of 15 mm Hg in SBP and 7 mm Hg in DBP from flaxseed ingestion. The antihypertensive effect was achieved selectively in hypertensive patients. Circulating alpha-linolenic acid levels correlated with SBP and DBP, and lignan levels correlated with changes in DBP. In summary, flaxseed induced one of the most potent antihypertensive effects achieved by a dietary intervention.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Antihypertensive Agents/*therapeutic use Blood Pressure/drug effects Diet Double-Blind Method Female *Flax Humans Hypertension/blood/*drug therapy Male Middle Aged *Phytotherapy Plant Preparations/pharmacology/*therapeutic use *Seeds Treatment Outcome alpha-Linolenic Acid/blood"

METHODS: Using a within-subjects, counterbalanced, crossover design, 37 children, 8 to 11 years of age (27% overweight/obese) completed a 3-week study. Children slept their typical amount at home for 1 week and were then randomized to either increase or decrease their time in bed by 1.5 hours per night for 1 week, completing the alternate schedule on the third week. Primary outcomes were dietary intake as assessed by 24-hour dietary recalls, food reinforcement (ie, points earned for a food reward), and fasting leptin and ghrelin. The secondary outcome was child weight. RESULTS: Participants achieved a 2 hour, 21 minute difference in the actigraph defined sleep period time between the increase and decrease sleep conditions (P < .001). Compared with the decrease sleep condition, during the increase condition, children reported consuming an average of 134 kcal/day less (P < .05), and exhibited lower fasting morning leptin values (P < .05). Measured weights were 0.22 kg lower during the increase sleep than the decrease sleep condition (P < .001). There were no differences in food reinforcement or in fasting ghrelin. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with decreased sleep, increased sleep duration in school-age children resulted in lower reported food intake, lower fasting leptin levels, and lower weight.

A broader range of eating disorders needs to be defined to diagnose these illnesses appropriately in males. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether males with psychiatric symptoms related to disordered eating and concern about physique are more likely to become obese, to start using drugs, to consume alcohol frequently (binge drinking), or to develop high levels of depressive symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The data come from questionnaires sent every 12 to 36 months from 1999 through 2010 to youth in a prospective cohort study, the Growing Up Today Study. The analysis included 5527 males aged 12 to 18 years in 1999 from across the United States who responded to the Growing Up Today Study questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Development of obesity and high levels of depressive symptoms and initiation of drug use and binge drinking at least monthly. RESULTS: From 1999 through 2011 in at least 1 study year, 9.2% of respondents reported high concerns with muscularity but no bulimic behaviors; 2.4%, high concerns with muscularity and use of supplements, growth hormone derivatives, or anabolic steroids to achieve their desired physique; 2.5%, high concerns with thinness but no bulimic behaviors; and 6.3%, high concerns with thinness and muscularity. For eating disorders, 0.8% had partial- or full-criteria bulimia nervosa or purging disorder and 2.9% had partial or full-criteria binge eating disorder but no association with the outcomes of interest. Infrequent binge eating or purging or overeating without a loss of control were reported by 31.0%. However, independent of age and body mass index, males with high concerns about thinness but not muscularity were more likely to develop high depressive symptoms (odds ratio, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.36-5.44). Males with high concerns about muscularity and thinness were more likely than their peers to use drugs (odds ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.31-3.46), and males with high concerns about muscularity who used supplements and other products to enhance physique were more likely to start binge drinking frequently (2.06; 1.58-2.69) and using drugs (2.16; 1.49-3.11). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: High concerns with muscularity are relatively common among adolescent boys and young men. Males with these concerns who use potentially unhealthy products to improve their physique are at increased risk of adverse outcomes but may not be recognized by their health care providers as having a weight-related disorder because of the sex-specific presentation.",Adolescent Adolescent Behavior/*psychology Binge Drinking/*psychology Body Image/*psychology Child Cohort Studies Eating Disorders/psychology Humans Male Obesity/*psychology Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Substance-Related Disorders/*psychology Young Adult

24171945,The association between retirement and age on physical activity in older adults.,Age Ageing,Godfrey A and Lord S and Galna B and Mathers JC and Burn DJ and Rochester L,Missing,"BACKGROUND: retirement is a major life change that is likely to affect lifestyles and yet little is still known about its influence on physical activity (PA). This study objectively quantified sedentary behaviour and ambulatory activity outcomes in retired and non-retired older, community-dwelling adults. METHODS: PA was quantified in 98 community-dwelling older adults (69.1 +/- 7.6 years) who wore an activPAL PA monitor (accelerometer) for seven consecutive days. Outcomes representing the volume, pattern and variability of sedentary behaviour and ambulatory activity were derived from the cross-sectional accelerometer data. The association between retirement, ageing and their interaction on sedentary and ambulatory outcomes were examined. RESULTS: being retired was associated with a reduced percentage of sedentary behaviour; reduced long bouts of sitting (>55 min) and increased the percentage of ambulatory activity. The volume of sedentary behaviour increased with age, whereas ambulatory activity reduced with age. Measures of pattern and variability did not change with retirement or age. With respect to recommended amounts of PA, there was no difference between retired and employed adults and only 21% achieved the recommended 150 min/week (accumulated in >/=10 min bouts of walking). CONCLUSION: while retirement was associated with a greater volume of PA, most older adults do not meet current recommended PA guidelines. Interventions are needed to increase PA in older adults in the years leading to and after the transition to retirement.",Missing

BACKGROUND: The hospital environment may contribute to patient discomfort by providing a lighting structure that interferes with circadian rhythmicity, sleep, mood and pain. DESIGN: A descriptive correlational design was used in this preliminary study. METHODS: Between May 2011-April 2012, data were collected from a convenience sample of 23 women and 17 men admitted to a large academically affiliated hospital in the United States. Over 72 hours, light exposure and sleep-wake patterns were continuously measured with wrist actigraph/light meters for each participant. Mood was measured daily using the Profile Of Mood States Brief Form. Subjective pain scores were abstracted from medical records. RESULTS: Light exposure levels were low: mean daytime light intensity was 104.80 lux. Sleep time was fragmented and low: mean 236.35 minutes of sleep/night. Intra-daily stability scores indicated little sleep-wake synchronization with light. Fatigue and total mood disturbance scores were high and inversely associated with light. Pain levels were also high and positively associated with fatigue, but not directly with light exposure. Low light exposure significantly predicted fatigue and total mood disturbance. CONCLUSION: Medical inpatients were exposed to light levels insufficient for circadian entrainment. Nevertheless, higher light exposure was associated with less fatigue and lower total mood disturbance in participants with pain, suggesting the need for further investigation to determine if manipulating light exposure for medical inpatients would be beneficial in affecting sleep-wake disturbances, mood and pain.",Missing
24152859,Mortality among high-risk patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted to U.S. teaching-intensive hospitals in July: a retrospective observational study.,Circulation,Jena AB and Sun EC and Romley JA,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Studies of whether inpatient mortality in US teaching hospitals rises in July as a result of organizational disruption and relative inexperience of new physicians (July effect) find small and mixed results, perhaps because study populations primarily include low-risk inpatients whose mortality outcomes are unlikely to exhibit a July effect. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the US Nationwide Inpatient sample, we estimated difference-in-difference models of mortality, percutaneous coronary intervention rates, and bleeding complication rates, for high- and low-risk patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted to 98 teaching-intensive and 1353 non-teaching-intensive hospitals during May and July 2002 to 2008. Among patients in the top quartile of predicted acute myocardial infarction mortality (high risk), adjusted mortality was lower in May than July in teaching-intensive hospitals (18.8% in May, 22.7% in July, P<0.01), but similar in non-teaching-intensive hospitals (22.5% in May, 22.8% in July, P=0.70). Among patients in the lowest three quartiles of predicted acute myocardial infarction mortality (low risk), adjusted mortality was similar in May and July in both teaching-intensive hospitals (2.1% in May, 1.9% in July, P=0.45) and non-teaching-intensive hospitals (2.7% in May, 2.8% in July, P=0.21). Differences in percutaneous coronary intervention and bleeding complication rates could not explain the observed July mortality effect among high risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: High-risk acute myocardial infarction patients experience similar mortality in teaching- and non-teaching-intensive hospitals in July, but lower mortality in teaching-intensive hospitals in May. Low-risk patients experience no such July effect in teaching-intensive hospitals.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Female Hospital Mortality/*trends Hospitals/statistics & numerical data Hospitals, Teaching/*statistics & numerical data Humans Inpatients Male Middle Aged Models, Statistical Myocardial Infarction/*epidemiology/*mortality Physicians Professional Competence Retrospective Studies Risk Factors *Seasons United States/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between dietary patterns in midlife and prevalence of healthy aging. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Nurses' Health Study. PARTICIPANTS: 10 670 women with dietary data and no major chronic diseases between 1984 and 1986, when they were in their late 50s and early 60s (median age, 59 years). Women provided information on health an average of 15 years later. MEASUREMENTS: Diet quality in midlife was ascertained using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010) and Alternate Mediterranean diet scores, averaged from 2 food-frequency questionnaires (1984 to 1986). ""Healthy"" aging was defined as survival to 70 years or older with maintenance of 4 health domains: no major chronic diseases or major impairments in cognitive or physical function or mental health. RESULTS: After multivariable adjustment, greater adherence to the AHEI-2010 (upper vs. lower quintiles) in midlife was related to 34% (95% CI, 9% to 66%; P for trend < 0.001) greater odds of healthy versus usual aging. Greater adherence to Alternate Mediterranean diet was related to 46% (CI, 17% to 83%; P for trend = 0.002) greater odds of healthy aging. When the 4 components of healthy aging were analyzed separately, the AHEI-2010 and Alternate Mediterranean diet were significantly associated with greater likelihood of no major limitations in physical function and mental health. LIMITATIONS: Residual confounding was possible, although many confounding factors were considered. Bias due to complex patterns of measurement error within diet scores cannot be excluded. CONCLUSION: Better diet quality at midlife seems to be strongly linked to greater health and well-being in persons surviving to older ages.

However, few studies have examined the relationship between observed neighborhood environmental characteristics and physical activity in a multiethnic urban area.PurposeThe purpose of this study was to assess relationships between neighborhood environments and physical activity and the extent to which these associations varied by demographic characteristics or perceptions of the physical and social environment. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses drew upon data collected from a stratified proportional probability sample of non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic White (NHW) adults (n = 919) in low-to-moderate income neighborhoods in Detroit, Michigan. Physical activity was assessed as self-reported duration and frequency of vigorous and moderate physical activity. Observed physical environment was assessed through systematic social observation by trained observers on blocks adjacent to survey respondents' residences. RESULTS: We find a positive association of sidewalk condition with physical activity, with stronger effects for younger compared with older residents. In addition, physical disorder was more negatively associated with physical activity among NHW and older residents. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that sidewalk improvements and reductions in physical disorder in urban communities may promote greater equity in physical activity.",Missing

STUDY DESIGN: Parents of n = 300 12-month-olds consuming >2 bottles/d were randomized to a bottle-weaning intervention or control group. Nutritionists at WIC Supplemental Feeding Program sites delivered the intervention. Researchers assessed dietary intake and beverage container use via computer-guided 24-hour recalls, and anthropometrics at 15, 18, 21, and 24 months old. Intent-to-treat analyses controlled for baseline measures of outcomes and months post-baseline. RESULTS: At 1 year follow-up, the intervention group had reduced use of any bottles (OR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.08-0.61), calories from milk bottles (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.18-0.74), and total calories (beta = -1.15, P = .043), but did not differ from controls in risk of overweight status (ie, >85th percentile weight-for-length (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.5-2.0). The intervention group's decreased bottle usage at 15 and 18 months was paralleled by increased ""sippy cup"" usage. CONCLUSION: A brief intervention, during WIC routine care, reduced early childhood risk factors for overweight-bottle use and energy intake--but not risk of overweight. The intervention group's increased use of sippy cups may have attenuated an intervention effect upon risk of overweight. Toddlers consume a high proportion of their calories as liquid.

METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter cohort study, women recently diagnosed with breast cancer at age </=40 years were surveyed regarding their initial signs or symptoms of cancer and delays in diagnosis. Self delay was defined as >/=90 days between the first sign or symptom and a patient's first visit to consult a health care provider. Care delay was defined as >/=90 days between that first visit and the diagnosis of breast cancer. In a medical record review, tumor characteristics were assessed, including disease stage. Univariate and multivariate models were used to assess for predictors of self delay, care delay, and advanced stage in the self-detected subset. RESULTS: In 585 eligible participants, the first sign or symptom of cancer was a self-detected breast abnormality for 80%, a clinical breast examination abnormality for 6%, an imaging abnormality for 12%, and a systemic symptom for 1%. Among women with self-detected cancers, 17% reported a self delay, and 12% reported a care delay. Self delays were associated with poorer financial status (P = 0.01). Among young women with self-detected breast cancers, care delay was associated at trend level (P = .06) with higher stage in multivariate modeling.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a brief cognitive behavioral intervention, problem-solving education (PSE), decreases parenting stress and maternal depressive symptoms during the period immediately following a child's diagnosis of ASD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial compared 6 sessions of PSE with usual care. Settings included an autism clinic and 6 community-based early intervention programs that primarily serve low-income families. Participants were mothers of 122 young children (mean age, 34 months) who recently received a diagnosis of ASD. Among mothers assessed for eligibility, 17.0% declined participation. We report outcomes after 3 months of follow-up (immediate postdiagnosis period). INTERVENTIONS: Problem-solving education is a brief, cognitive intervention delivered in six 30-minute individualized sessions by existing staff (early intervention programs) or research staff without formal mental health training (autism clinic). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were parental stress and maternal depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Fifty-nine mothers were randomized to receive PSE and 63 to receive usual care. The follow-up rate was 91.0%. Most intervention mothers (78.0%) received the full PSE course. At the 3-month follow-up assessment, PSE mothers were significantly less likely than those serving as controls to have clinically significant parental stress (3.8% vs 29.3%; adjusted relative risk [aRR], 0.17; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.65). For depressive symptoms, the risk reduction in clinically significant symptoms did not reach statistical significance (5.7% vs 22.4%; aRR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.10 to 1.08); however, the reduction in mean depressive symptoms was statistically significant (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology score, 4.6 with PSE vs 6.9 with usual care; adjusted mean difference, -1.67; 95% CI, -3.17 to -0.18). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The positive effects of PSE in reducing parenting stress and depressive symptoms during the critical postdiagnosis period, when parents are asked to navigate a complex service delivery system, suggest that it may have a place in clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that overweight and obesity with and without metabolic syndrome are associated with increased risk of MI and IHD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We examined 71,527 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study and categorized them according to body mass index (BMI) as normal weight, overweight, or obese and according to absence or presence of metabolic syndrome. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hazard ratios for incident MI and IHD according to combinations of BMI category and absence or presence of metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: During a median of 3.6 years' follow-up, we recorded 634 incident MI and 1781 incident IHD events. For MI, multivariable adjusted hazard ratios vs normal weight individuals without metabolic syndrome were 1.26 (95% CI, 1.00-1.61) in overweight and 1.88 (95% CI, 1.34-2.63) in obese individuals without metabolic syndrome and 1.39 (95% CI, 0.96-2.02) in normal weight, 1.70 (95% CI, 1.35-2.15) in overweight, and 2.33 (95% CI, 1.81-3.00) in obese individuals with metabolic syndrome. For IHD, results were similar but attenuated. Normal weight vs overweight vs obesity and presence vs absence of metabolic syndrome did not interact on risk of MI or IHD (P = .90 and P = .44). Among individuals both with and without metabolic syndrome there were increasing cumulative incidences of MI and IHD from normal weight through overweight to obese individuals (log-rank trend P = .006 to P < .001). Although the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for MI in individuals with vs without metabolic syndrome was 1.54 (95% CI, 1.32-1.81) across all BMI categories, addition of metabolic syndrome to a multivariable model including BMI and other clinical characteristics improved the Harell C-statistic only slightly for risk of MI (comparison P = .03) but not for IHD (P = .41). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that overweight and obesity are risk factors for MI and IHD regardless of the presence or absence of metabolic syndrome and that metabolic syndrome is no more valuable than BMI in identifying individuals at risk.",Adult Aged Body Mass Index Case-Control Studies Cross-Sectional Studies Denmark/epidemiology Female Humans Male Metabolic Syndrome X/*epidemiology Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Myocardial Infarction/*epidemiology Myocardial Ischemia/epidemiology Obesity/*epidemiology Overweight/epidemiology Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Risk Factors
24143905,A multisport epidemiologic comparison of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in high school athletics.,J Athl Train,Joseph AM and Collins CL and Henke NM and Yard EE and Fields SK and Comstock RD,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The knee joint is the second most commonly injured body site after the ankle and the leading cause of sport-related surgeries. Knee injuries, especially of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), are among the most economically costly sport injuries, frequently requiring expensive surgery and rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology of ACL injuries among high school athletes by sport and sex. DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Using an Internet-based data-collection tool, Reporting Information Online (RIO), certified athletic trainers from 100 nationally representative US high schools reported athlete-exposure and injury data for athletes from 9 sports during the 2007/08-2011/12 academic years. The outcome of interest in this study was ACL injuries. RESULTS: During the study period, 617 ACL injuries were reported during 9 452 180 athlete exposures (AEs), for an injury rate of 6.5 per 100 000 AEs. Nationally, in the 9 sports studied, an estimated 215 628 ACL injuries occurred during the study period. The injury rate was higher in competition (17.6) than practice (2.4; rate ratio [RR] = 7.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.08, 8.68). Girls' soccer had the highest injury rate (12.2) followed by boys' football (11.1), with boys' basketball (2.3) and boys' baseball (0.7) having the lowest rates. In sex-comparable sports, girls had a higher rate (8.9) than boys (2.6; RR = 3.4, 95% CI = 2.64, 4.47). Overall, 76.6% of ACL injuries resulted in surgery. The most common mechanisms of injury were player-to-player contact (42.8%) and no contact (37.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Anterior cruciate ligament injury rates vary by sport, sex, and type of exposure. Recognizing such differences is important when evaluating the effectiveness of evidence-based, targeted prevention efforts.",Adolescent Anterior Cruciate Ligament/*injuries/surgery Athletes Athletic Injuries/*epidemiology Female Humans Knee/surgery Knee Injuries/*epidemiology/physiopathology/surgery Knee Joint/surgery Male Schools Sex Factors Sports Students
24217469,Opioid prescribing: a systematic review and critical appraisal of guidelines for chronic pain.,Ann Intern Med,Nuckols TK and Anderson L and Popescu I and Diamant AL and Doyle B and Di Capua P and Chou R,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Deaths due to prescription opioid overdoses have increased dramatically. High-quality guidelines could help clinicians mitigate risks associated with opioid therapy. PURPOSE: To evaluate the quality and content of guidelines on the use of opioids for chronic pain. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, National Guideline Clearinghouse, specialty society Web sites, and international guideline clearinghouses (searched in July 2013). STUDY SELECTION: Guidelines published between January 2007 and July 2013 addressing the use of opioids for chronic pain in adults were selected. Guidelines on specific settings, populations, and conditions were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: Guidelines and associated systematic reviews were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument and A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR), respectively, and recommendations for mitigating opioid-related risks were compared. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirteen guidelines met selection criteria. Overall AGREE II scores were 3.00 to 6.20 (on a scale of 1 to 7). The AMSTAR ratings were poor to fair for 10 guidelines. Two received high AGREE II and AMSTAR scores. Most guidelines recommend that clinicians avoid doses greater than 90 to 200 mg of morphine equivalents per day, have additional knowledge to prescribe methadone, recognize risks of fentanyl patches, titrate cautiously, and reduce doses by at least 25% to 50% when switching opioids. Guidelines also agree that opioid risk assessment tools, written treatment agreements, and urine drug testing can mitigate risks. Most recommendations are supported by observational data or expert consensus. LIMITATION: Exclusion of non-English-language guidelines and reliance on published information. CONCLUSION: Despite limited evidence and variable development methods, recent guidelines on chronic pain agree on several opioid risk mitigation strategies, including upper dosing thresholds; cautions with certain medications; attention to drug-drug and drug-disease interactions; and use of risk assessment tools, treatment agreements, and urine drug testing. Future research should directly examine the effectiveness of opioid risk mitigation strategies.

24218472,Overweight adolescents and life events in childhood.,Pediatrics,Lumeng JC and Wendorf K and Pesch MH and Appugliese DP and Kaciroti N and Corwyn RF and Bradley RH,umich,"OBJECTIVES: To test the association of life events in childhood with overweight risk in adolescence; to examine the effects of chronicity, timing, intensity, valence, and type of life events; and to test potential moderators. METHODS: Mothers of children enrolled in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development responded to the Life Experiences Survey at ages 4, 9, and 11 years. Using logistic regression analysis, we tested the association of experiencing many negative life events with being overweight at age 15 years, controlling for child gender, race/ethnicity, maternal education, and maternal obesity. Child gender, maternal education, maternal obesity, child's ability to delay gratification for food, and maternal sensitivity were tested as moderators. RESULTS: Among the 848 study children (82% non-Hispanic white), experiencing many negative life events was associated with a higher risk of overweight (odds ratio: 1.47 [95% confidence interval: 1.04-2.10]). Greater chronicity and negative valence of the event were associated with greater overweight risk; timing of exposure and maternal reported impact of the event were not. The association was more robust for events related to family physical or mental health and among children of obese mothers and children who waited longer for food. CONCLUSIONS: Children who experience many negative life events are at higher risk of being overweight by age 15 years. Future work should investigate mechanisms involved in this association, particularly those connected to appetitive drive and self-regulation; these mechanisms may hold promise for obesity prevention strategies.","Adolescent Appetite Child Child, Preschool Female Health Surveys Humans *Life Change Events Logistic Models Longitudinal Studies Male Maternal Behavior Odds Ratio Overweight/*etiology/psychology Prospective Studies Risk Factors Social Control, Informal United States"
24210607,Let there be no light: the effect of bedside light on sleep quality and background electroencephalographic rhythms.,Sleep Med,Cho JR and Joo EY and Koo DL and Hong SB,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: Artificial lighting has been beneficial to society, but unnecessary light exposure at night may cause various health problems. We aimed to investigate how whole-night bedside light can affect sleep quality and brain activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten healthy sleepers underwent two polysomnography (PSG) sessions, one with the lights off and one with the lights on. PSG variables related to sleep quality were extracted and compared between lights-off and lights-on sleep. Spectral analysis was performed to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep epochs to reveal any light-induced differences in background brain rhythms. RESULTS: Lights-on sleep was associated with increased stage 1 sleep (N1), decreased slow-wave sleep (SWS), and increased arousal index. Spectral analysis revealed that theta power (4-8Hz) during REM sleep and slow oscillation (0.5-1Hz), delta (1-4Hz), and spindle (10-16Hz) power during NREM sleep were decreased in lights-on sleep conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Sleeping with the light on not only causes shallow sleep and frequent arousals but also has a persistent effect on brain oscillations, especially those implicated in sleep depth and stability.

24461756,Human infection with avian influenza A H6N1 virus: an epidemiological analysis.,Lancet Respir Med,Wei SH and Yang JR and Wu HS and Chang MC and Lin JS and Lin CY and Liu YL and Lo YC and Yang CH and Chuang JH and Lin MC and Chung WC and Liao CH and Lee MS and Huang WT and Chen PJ and Liu MT and Chang FY,cdc,"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza A H6N1 virus is one of the most common viruses isolated from wild and domestic avian species, but human infection with this virus has not been previously reported. We report the clinical presentation, contact, and environmental investigations of a patient infected with this virus, and assess the origin and genetic characteristics of the isolated virus. METHODS: A 20-year-old woman with an influenza-like illness presented to a hospital with shortness of breath in May, 2013. An unsubtyped influenza A virus was isolated from her throat-swab specimen and was transferred to the Taiwan Centres for Disease Control (CDC) for identification. The medical records were reviewed to assess the clinical presentation. We did a contact and environmental investigation and collected clinical specimens from the case and symptomatic contacts to test for influenza virus. The genomic sequences of the isolated virus were determined and characterised. FINDINGS: The unsubtyped influenza A virus was identified as the H6N1 subtype, based on sequences of the genes encoding haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. The source of infection was not established. Sequence analyses showed that this human isolate was highly homologous to chicken H6N1 viruses in Taiwan and had been generated through interclade reassortment. Notably, the virus had a G228S substitution in the haemagglutinin protein that might increase its affinity for the human alpha2-6 linked sialic acid receptor. INTERPRETATION: This is the first report of human infection with a wild avian influenza A H6N1 virus. A unique clade of H6N1 viruses with a G228S substitution of haemagglutinin have circulated persistently in poultry in Taiwan. These viruses continue to evolve and accumulate changes, increasing the potential risk of human-to-human transmission. Our report highlights the continuous need for preparedness for a pandemic of unpredictable and complex avian influenza. FUNDING: Taiwan Centres for Disease Control.",Missing
24186973,The association of aerobic fitness with injuries in the fire service.,Am J Epidemiol,Poplin GS and Roe DJ and Peate W and Harris RB and Burgess JL,Missing,"The aim of the present study was to understand the risk of injury in relation to fitness in a retrospective occupational cohort of firefighters in Tucson, Arizona, from 2005 to 2009. Annual medical evaluations and injury surveillance data were linked to compare levels of aerobic fitness in injured employees with those in noninjured employees. The individual outcomes evaluated included all injuries, exercise-related injuries, and sprains and strains. Time-to-event analyses were conducted to determine the association between levels of fitness and injury likelihood. Fitness, defined by relative aerobic capacity (Vo2max), was associated with injury risk. Persons in the lowest fitness level category (Vo2max <43 mL/kg/minute) were 2.2 times more likely (95% confidence interval: 1.72, 2.88) to sustain injury than were those in the highest fitness level category (Vo2max >48 mL/kg/minute). Those with a Vo2max between 43 and 48 mL/kg/minute were 1.38 times (95% confidence interval: 1.06, 1.78) more likely to incur injury. Hazard ratios were found to be greater for sprains and strains. Our results suggest that improving relative aerobic capacity by 1 metabolic equivalent of task (approximately 3.5 mL/kg/minute) reduces the risk of any injury by 14%. These findings illustrate the importance of fitness in reducing the risk of injury in physically demanding occupations, such as the fire service, and support the need to provide dedicated resources for structured fitness programming and the promotion of injury prevention strategies to people in those fields.",Adult Age Factors Arizona/epidemiology Exercise Female *Fires Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Occupational Injuries/*epidemiology *Physical Fitness
24309218,"Immediate postabortion access to IUDs, implants and DMPA reduces repeat pregnancy within 1 year in a New York City practice.",Contraception,Langston AM and Joslin-Roher SL and Westhoff CL,columbia,"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate whether having intrauterine devices (IUDs), contraceptive implants and injections immediately available to women undergoing abortion, compared to requiring an additional visit for these methods, leads to fewer pregnancies and fewer abortions in the following 12 months. METHODS: We conducted a historical cohort study using health records of Medicaid-insured women obtaining a first-trimester surgical abortion within a single practice in New York City. Women in Cohort 1 (2007-2008) needed an additional visit to initiate the IUD or injection. Women in Cohort 2 (2008-2009) were able to initiate these contraceptives and implants during the abortion visit. Women in both cohorts received these methods without additional cost, and all could receive a pill, patch or ring prescription. We compared the proportions of each cohort who experienced a pregnancy that began in the 12 months following the index abortion and also evaluated the outcomes of those pregnancies. RESULTS: Cohorts 1 and 2 consisted of 407 and 405 women, respectively. The proportions with pregnancy beginning over the following 12 months were substantially greater in Cohort 1 than Cohort 2 (27.3% versus 15.3%, p<.001). Women in Cohort 1 then underwent both more additional abortions (17.2% versus 9.9%, p=.003) and more births (7.9% versus 3.7%, p=.02). The proportion of women in Cohort 1 who initiated IUDs and implants within 12 months was smaller than in Cohort 2 (11% versus 46%, p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among women insured by Medicaid, offering immediate comprehensive contraceptive access--including IUDs and implants--on the same day as an induced abortion, compared to requiring an additional visit, increased uptake of IUDs and implants and decreased repeat pregnancies in the next 12 months and abortions.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether higher baseline body mass index and waist circumference affect women's survival to 85 years of age without major chronic disease (coronary disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes mellitus, or hip fracture) and mobility disability. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Examination of 36,611 women from the Women's Health Initiative observational study and clinical trial programs who could have reached 85 years or older if they survived to the last outcomes evaluation on September 17, 2012. Recruitment was from 40 US clinical centers from October 1993 through December 1998. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% CIs for the association of baseline body mass index and waist circumference with the outcomes, adjusting for demographic, behavioral, and health characteristics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mutually exclusive classifications: (1) survived without major chronic disease and without mobility disability (healthy); (2) survived with 1 or more major chronic disease at baseline but without new disease or disability (prevalent diseased); (3) survived and developed 1 or more major chronic disease but not disability during study follow-up (incident diseased); (4) survived and developed mobility disability with or without disease (disabled); and (5) did not survive (died). RESULTS: Mean (SD) baseline age was 72.4 (3.0) years (range, 66-81 years). The distribution of women classified as healthy, prevalent diseased, incident diseased, disabled, and died was 19.0%, 14.7%, 23.2%, 18.3%, and 24.8%, respectively. Compared with healthy-weight women, underweight and obese women were more likely to die before 85 years of age. Overweight and obese women had higher risks of incident disease and mobility disability. Disability risks were striking. Relative to healthy-weight women, adjusted odds ratios (95% CIs) of mobility disability were 1.6 (1.5-1.8) for overweight women and 3.2 (2.9-3.6), 6.6 (5.4-8.1), and 6.7 (4.8-9.2) for class I, II, and III obesity, respectively. Waist circumference greater than 88 cm was also associated with higher risk of earlier death, incident disease, and mobility disability. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Overall and abdominal obesity were important and potentially modifiable factors associated with dying or developing mobility disability and major chronic disease before 85 years of age in older women.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Body Mass Index Chronic Disease/*epidemiology Comorbidity Disease-Free Survival Female Humans Logistic Models *Mobility Limitation Obesity/*mortality Obesity, Abdominal/mortality Odds Ratio Risk Factors Thinness/mortality Waist Circumference"
24249825,"Media use and sleep among boys with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, or typical development.",Pediatrics,Engelhardt CR and Mazurek MO and Sohl K,missouri,"OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the relationships between media use (television, computer, and video games) and sleep among boys with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or with typical development (TD). METHODS: Participants included parents of boys with ASD (n = 49), ADHD (n = 38), or TD (n = 41) (ages 8-17 years). Questionnaires assessed daily hours of media use, bedroom access to media, and average sleep hours per night. RESULTS: Bedroom media access was associated with less time spent sleeping per night, irrespective of diagnostic group. Bedroom access to a television or a computer was more strongly associated with reduced sleep among boys with ASD compared with boys with ADHD or TD. Multivariate models showed that, in addition to bedroom access, the amount of time spent playing video games was uniquely associated with less sleep among boys with ASD. In the ASD group only, the relationship between bedroom access to video games and reduced sleep was mediated by hours of video game play. CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that media-related variables may be an important consideration in understanding sleep disturbances in children with ASD. Further research is needed to better characterize the processes by which media use may affect sleep among individuals with ASD. Overall, the current findings suggest that screen-based media time and bedroom media access should be routinely assessed and may be important intervention targets when addressing sleep problems in children with ASD.","Adolescent Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/physiopathology/*psychology Case-Control Studies Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/physiopathology/*psychology Humans Linear Models Male Multivariate Analysis Questionnaires *Sleep *Television/utilization Time Factors *Video Games/adverse effects/psychology/statistics & numerical data"

Whether weight reduction and cardiometabolic risk factor management can reduce the burden of atrial fibrillation is not known. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of weight reduction and management of cardiometabolic risk factors on atrial fibrillation burden and cardiac structure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Single-center, partially blinded, randomized controlled study conducted between June 2010 and December 2011 in Adelaide, Australia, among overweight and obese ambulatory patients (N = 150) with symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Patients underwent a median of 15 months of follow-up. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to weight management (intervention) or general lifestyle advice (control). Both groups underwent intensive management of cardiometabolic risk factors. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale scores: symptom burden and symptom severity. Scores were measured every 3 months from baseline to 15 months. Secondary outcomes performed at baseline and 12 months were total atrial fibrillation episodes and cumulative duration measured by 7-day Holter, echocardiographic left atrial area, and interventricular septal thickness. RESULTS: Of 248 patients screened, 150 were randomized (75 per group) and underwent follow-up. The intervention group showed a significantly greater reduction, compared with the control group, in weight (14.3 and 3.6 kg, respectively; P < .001) and in atrial fibrillation symptom burden scores (11.8 and 2.6 points, P < .001), symptom severity scores (8.4 and 1.7 points, P < .001), number of episodes (2.5 and no change, P = .01), and cumulative duration (692-minute decline and 419-minute increase, P = .002). Additionally, there was a reduction in interventricular septal thickness in the intervention and control groups (1.1 and 0.6 mm, P = .02) and left atrial area (3.5 and 1.9 cm2, P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, weight reduction with intensive risk factor management resulted in a reduction in atrial fibrillation symptom burden and severity and in beneficial cardiac remodeling. These findings support therapy directed at weight and risk factors in the management of atrial fibrillation.

24247736,Environmental phthalate exposure and preterm birth.,JAMA Pediatr,Ferguson KK and McElrath TF and Meeker JD,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal mortality, with a variety of contributing causes and risk factors. Environmental exposures represent a group of understudied, but potentially important, factors. Phthalate diesters are used extensively in a variety of consumer products worldwide. Consequently, exposure in pregnant women is highly prevalent. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between phthalate exposure during pregnancy and preterm birth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nested case-control study was conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. Women were recruited for a prospective observational cohort study from 2006-2008. Each provided demographic data, biological samples, and information about birth outcomes. From within this group, we selected 130 cases of preterm birth and 352 randomly assigned control participants, and we analyzed urine samples from up to 3 time points during pregnancy for levels of phthalate metabolites. EXPOSURE: Phthalate exposure during pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We examined associations between average levels of phthalate exposure during pregnancy and preterm birth, defined as fewer than 37 weeks of completed gestation, as well as spontaneous preterm birth, defined as preterm preceded by spontaneous preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of the membranes (n = 57). RESULTS: Geometric means of the di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites mono-(2-ethyl)-hexyl phthalate (MEHP) and mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), as well as mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), were significantly higher in cases compared with control participants. In adjusted models, MEHP, MECPP, and Sigma DEHP metabolites were associated with significantly increased odds of preterm birth. When spontaneous preterm births were examined alone, MEHP, mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, MECPP, Sigma DEHP, MBP, and mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate metabolite levels were all associated with significantly elevated odds of prematurity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Women exposed to phthalates during pregnancy have significantly increased odds of delivering preterm. Steps should be taken to decrease maternal exposure to phthalates during pregnancy.","Adult Case-Control Studies Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects Female Humans Infant, Newborn Massachusetts/epidemiology *Maternal Exposure Phthalic Acids/*adverse effects/urine Pregnancy Premature Birth/*chemically induced/urine Prospective Studies Risk Factors Young Adult"

The impact of neurodevelopmental disability at age 7 to 8 years on young adult outcomes was examined. METHODS: Participants underwent a comprehensive face-to-face interview that included standardized assessment tools and previously used custom written survey items. RESULTS: We interviewed 230 VLBW young adults (71% of survivors) and 69 controls at age 22 to 23 years. VLBW young adults were 5.6 kg lighter and 4.2 cm shorter than controls, had lower rates of tertiary education/training (percentage difference [95% confidence interval]: -13.1 [-21.6 to -1.8]) and university degree completion (-15.6 [-28.0 to -4.8]), had more often been welfare dependent (23.5 [10.2 to 35.0]), had few or no friends (20.5 [7.2 to 32.2]), and more often had wheeze in the past year (20.1 [9.0 to 28.6]). However, in many areas there were no differences between the VLBW cohort and controls, and VLBW adults rated their overall quality of life and behavioral functioning similarly to their peers. Those with previous disability had poorer social, occupational, and physical functioning than other VLBW young adults. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some evidence of health, educational, and social difficulties, former VLBW young adults obtained similar scores across many aspects of health and social functioning as their same age peers, with some differences largely confined to those with previous disability.","Case-Control Studies Child Developmental Disabilities/physiopathology/psychology Female Follow-Up Studies *Health Status Health Surveys Humans Infant, Newborn *Infant, Very Low Birth Weight Interviews as Topic Linear Models Male New Zealand *Quality of Life Self Report *Social Behavior *Social Environment Socioeconomic Factors Young Adult/*psychology/statistics & numerical data"

The purpose of this study was to examine disparity in specialist consultation and multimodality treatment and the impact that treatment inequality has on survival. METHODS: We identified 9935 non-Hispanic white and 1281 black patients with stage IV colorectal cancer aged 66 years and older from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. Logistic regression models identified race-based differences in consultation rates and subsequent treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Multivariable Cox regression models identified potential factors that explain race-based survival differences. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Black patients had lower rates of consultation with surgery, medical oncology, and radiation oncology. Among patients seen in consultation, black patients received less surgery directed at the primary tumor, liver- or lung-directed surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Unadjusted survival analysis found a 15% higher chance of dying for black patients compared with white patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08 to 1.22; P < .001). Adjustment for patient, tumor, and demographic variables marginally reduced the risk of death (HR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.15; P = .03). After adjustment for differences in treatment, the increased risk of death for black patients disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows racial disparity in specialist consultation as well as subsequent treatment with multimodality therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer, and it suggests that inferior survival for black patients may stem from this treatment disparity. Further research into the underlying causes of this inequality will improve access to treatment and survival in metastatic colorectal cancer.","African Americans/*statistics & numerical data Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/statistics & numerical data Colorectal Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology/*therapy Combined Modality Therapy/*statistics & numerical data European Continental Ancestry Group/*statistics & numerical data Female Healthcare Disparities/*statistics & numerical data Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Medical Oncology/statistics & numerical data Medical Record Linkage Medicare Neoplasm Staging Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/statistics & numerical data Referral and Consultation/*statistics & numerical data SEER Program Treatment Outcome United States/epidemiology"
24254416,Is precarious employment associated with women remaining childless until age 35 years? Results from an Australian birth cohort study.,Hum Reprod,Steele EJ and Giles LC and Davies MJ and Moore VM,Missing,"STUDY QUESTION: Does time in casual employment (while not studying full time) affect the likelihood of a woman having a child by age 35? SUMMARY ANSWER: Duration of time spent in casual employment is associated with an increased likelihood of childlessness at age 35 years, irrespective of socio-economic background as indicated by educational level. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Precarious employment conditions have become increasingly prevalent in recent decades in Western countries. The relationship between precarious employment conditions and age at first childbirth has been examined in several European countries with varying results. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective cross-sectional component (n = 663) was added to an existing study based on a cohort of women born during 1973-1975. An event history calendar instrument was used to obtain data regarding a range of life domains over a 20-year period. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Using data from the Life Journeys of Young Women Project carried out in Adelaide, South Australia, Cox proportional hazards models were applied to investigate the research questions. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The likelihood of childbirth by around age 35 was reduced for every year spent in casual employment, irrespective of socioeconomic status, partner's education and parents' birthplace. The likelihood was reduced by 8, 23 and 35% for 1, 3 and 5 years spent in casual employment, respectively. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Women with longer employment histories (and greater age at first birth) had more opportunities for errors in recall, but it is unlikely that such errors were systematic and led to bias in the results. While we included variables reflecting partner's education and length of time with a live-in partner, partner's employment histories were not taken into account. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Duration of time spent in casual employment is associated with an increased likelihood of childlessness at age 35 years, and this association is present across the spectrum of socioeconomic status. We suggest that upstream labour market reforms could be considered in order to reduce barriers to childbearing.",Adolescent Adult Australia *Birth Order Cohort Studies *Educational Status *Employment Female Humans Retrospective Studies Social Class Socioeconomic Factors
24200654,"Where are kids getting their empty calories? Stores, schools, and fast-food restaurants each played an important role in empty calorie intake among US children during 2009-2010.",J Acad Nutr Diet,Poti JM and Slining MM and Popkin BM,Missing,"Consumption of empty calories, the sum of energy from added sugar and solid fat, exceeds recommendations, but little is known about where US children obtain these empty calories. The objectives of this study were to compare children's empty calorie consumption from retail food stores, schools, and fast-food restaurants; to identify food groups that were top contributors of empty calories from each location; and to determine the location providing the majority of calories for these key food groups. This cross-sectional analysis used data from 3,077 US children aged 2 to 18 years participating in the 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The empty calorie content of children's intake from stores (33%), schools (32%), and fast-food restaurants (35%) was not significantly different in 2009-2010. In absolute terms, stores provided the majority of empty calorie intake (436 kcal). The top contributors of added sugar and solid fat from each location were similar: sugar-sweetened beverages, grain desserts, and high-fat milk * from stores; high-fat milk, grain desserts, and pizza from schools; and sugar-sweetened beverages, dairy desserts, french fries, and pizza from fast-food restaurants. Schools contributed about 20% of children's intake of high-fat milk and pizza. These findings support the need for continued efforts to reduce empty calorie intake among US children aimed not just at fast-food restaurants, but also at stores and schools. The importance of reformed school nutrition standards was suggested, as prior to implementation of these changes, schools resembled fast-food restaurants in their contributions to empty calorie intake.","Adolescent *Adolescent Behavior Child *Child Behavior Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Diet Surveys Dietary Carbohydrates/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics Dietary Fats/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics Dietary Sucrose/administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics *Energy Intake Fast Foods/economics *Feeding Behavior Female Food Services Humans Male Restaurants Schools United States"

OBJECTIVE: We prospectively determined the association between diet quality and quality of life and activities of daily living. DESIGN: This was an observational cohort study in which total diet scores, reflecting adherence to dietary guidelines, were determined. Dietary intakes were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Total diet scores were allocated for intake of selected food groups and nutrients for each participant as described in the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. Higher scores indicated closer adherence to dietary guidelines. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: In Sydney, Australia, 1,305 and 895 participants (aged >/= 55 years) with complete data were examined over 5 and 10 years, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLES: The 36-Item Short-Form Survey assesses quality of life and has eight subscales representing dimensions of health and well-being; higher scores reflect better quality of life. Functional status was determined once at the 10-year follow-up by the Older Americans Resources and Services activities of daily living scale. This scale has 14 items: seven items assess basic activities of daily living (eg, eating and walking) and seven items assess instrumental activities of daily living (eg, shopping or housework). STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Normalized 36-Item Short-Form Survey component scores were used in analysis of covariance to calculate multivariable adjusted mean scores. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios and 95% CIs to demonstrate the association between total diet score with the 5-year incidence of impaired activities of daily living. RESULTS: Participants in the highest vs lowest quartile of baseline total diet scores had adjusted mean scores 5.6, 4.0, 5.3, and 2.6 units higher in these 36-Item Short-Form Survey domains 5 years later: physical function (P trend=0.003), general health (P trend=0.02), vitality (P trend=0.001), and physical composite score (P trend=0.003), respectively. Participants in the highest vs lowest quartile of baseline total diet scores had 50% reduced risk of impaired instrumental activites of daily living at follow-up (multivariable-adjusted P trend=0.03).

24215801,"Increasing the number of chews before swallowing reduces meal size in normal-weight, overweight, and obese adults.",J Acad Nutr Diet,Zhu Y and Hollis JH,Missing,"Eating slowly contributes to a lower risk of obesity, probably because it could aid appetite control. Chewing thoroughly is an effective strategy to reduce eating rate; however, insufficient data are available to demonstrate the relationship between such an eating behavior and energy intake. To investigate the effect of increasing the number of chews before swallowing on meal size, a randomized cross-over trial was conducted in 18- to 45-year-old normal-weight, overweight, and obese participants (n=45) who were recruited from the local community (Ames, IA). After assessment of baseline number of chews, participants were asked to attend three test sessions to eat pizza for lunch until comfortably full by chewing each portion of food either 100%, 150%, or 200% of their baseline number of chews before swallowing. Two-way analysis of variance was used to test the effect of treatment and body-weight status, as well as their interactions on food intake, meal duration, eating rate, and appetite at meal termination. Appetite data during 60 minutes were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. Food intake in the sessions with 150% and 200% of their baseline number of chews was reduced significantly, by 9.5% and 14.8%, respectively, compared with the 100% session. Increasing the number of chews also prolonged meal duration and reduced eating rate. However, subjective appetite at meal termination or during the immediate postprandial period did not differ. These data indicate that increasing the number of chews before swallowing might be a behavioral strategy to reduce food intake and potentially aid body-weight management.","Adult *Appetite Regulation *Behavior Control Body Mass Index Cross-Over Studies Diet, Reducing/*methods *Energy Intake Feeding Behavior Female Humans Iowa Lunch Male *Mastication Obesity/*diet therapy/prevention & control Overweight/*diet therapy/prevention & control Time Factors Young Adult"

Method Between 1999 and 2008 all pregnant Norwegian women were eligible for recruitment into the prospective Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. The mothers were asked to report on their use of paracetamol at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and at 6 months postpartum. We used data on 48 631 children whose mothers returned the 3-year follow-up questionnaire by May 2011. Within this sample were 2919 same-sex sibling pairs who were used to adjust for familial and genetic factors. We modelled psychomotor development (communication, fine and gross motor development), externalizing and internalizing behaviour problems, and temperament (emotionality, activity, sociability and shyness) based on prenatal paracetamol exposure using generalized linear regression, adjusting for a number of factors, including febrile illness, infections and co-medication use during pregnancy. RESULTS: The sibling-control analysis revealed that children exposed to prenatal paracetamol for more than 28 days had poorer gross motor development [beta 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.51], communication (beta 0.20, 95% CI 0.01-0.39), externalizing behaviour (beta 0.28, 95% CI 0.15-0.42), internalizing behaviour (beta 0.14, 95% CI 0.01-0.28), and higher activity levels (beta 0.24, 95% CI 0.11-0.38). Children exposed prenatally to short-term use of paracetamol (1-27 days) also had poorer gross motor outcomes (beta 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.19), but the effects were smaller than with long-term use. Ibuprofen exposure was not associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes. CONCLUSION: Children exposed to long-term use of paracetamol during pregnancy had substantially adverse developmental outcomes at 3 years of age.",Missing

24263465,Parental perspectives on adolescent hearing loss risk and prevention.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Sekhar DL and Clark SJ and Davis MM and Singer DC and Paul IM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Data indicate that 1 in 6 adolescents has high-frequency hearing loss, which is typically noise related and preventable. Parental participation improves the success of adolescent behavioral interventions, yet little is known about parental perspectives regarding adolescent noise-induced hearing loss. OBJECTIVE: To perform a survey to determine parental knowledge of adolescent hearing loss and willingness to promote hearing conservation to discern information that is critical to design adolescent hearing loss prevention programs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional, Internet-based survey of a nationally representative online sample of parents of 13- to 17-year-olds. INTERVENTIONS: A survey conducted with the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health, a recurring online survey. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Parental knowledge of adolescent hearing loss and willingness to promote hearing conservation. RESULTS: Of 716 eligible respondents, 96.3% of parents reported that their adolescent was slightly or not at all at risk of hearing problems from excessive noise, and 69.0% had not spoken with their adolescent about noise exposure, mainly because of the perceived low risk. Nonetheless, to protect their adolescents' hearing, more than 65.0% of parents are either willing or very willing to consider limiting time listening to music, limiting access to excessively noisy situations, or insisting on the use of hearing protection (earplugs or earmuffs). Higher parental education increased the odds of promoting hearing-protective strategies. Parents were less likely to insist on hearing protection for older adolescents. Parents who understood that both volume and time of exposure affect hearing damage were more likely to have discussed hearing loss with their adolescent (odds ratio [OR], 1.98; 95% CI, 1.29-3.03). The odds of discussing hearing loss were also increased for those who were willing or very willing to limit time listening to music (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.19-2.26) and to insist on hearing protection (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.15-3.18) compared with parents who were very unwilling, unwilling, or neutral. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite the rising prevalence of acquired adolescent hearing loss, few parents believe their adolescent is at risk. Those with higher education are more willing to promote hearing conservation, especially with younger adolescents. To create effective hearing conservation programs, parents need better education on this subject as well as effective and acceptable strategies to prevent adolescent noise exposure.","Adolescent *Adolescent Behavior Cross-Sectional Studies Female Hearing Loss, Noise-Induced/*prevention & control Humans Internet Male *Parent-Child Relations Parents/*psychology Risk Factors"

Such discordance may be owing to worse vision in the home than measured in clinic. OBJECTIVE: To compare vision measured between the clinic and home and evaluate factors, including lighting, associated with these differences. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study conducted from 2005-2009 involved 126 patients with glaucoma and 49 without glaucoma recruited from the Glaucoma and Comprehensive Eye Clinics at Washington University, St Louis, Missouri. Patients underwent clinic and home visits, were aged 55 to 90 years, were consecutively recruited, and met inclusion criteria for this study. A total of 166 eligible patients refused participation. EXPOSURE: Participants underwent clinic and home visits randomized to order of completion. At each visit, masked and certified examiners measured binocular distance visual acuity (DVA) with a nonbacklit chart, near visual acuity (NVA), contrast sensitivity (CS), CS with glare, and lighting. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Differences in vision between the clinic and home. RESULTS: The mean scores for all vision tests were significantly better in the clinic than home for participants with and without glaucoma (P < .05, matched-pair t tests). For DVA, 29% of participants with glaucoma read 2 or more lines better in the clinic than home and 39% with advanced glaucoma read 3 or more lines better. For the entire sample, 21% of participants read 2 or more lines better in the clinic than home for NVA and 49% read 2 or more triplets better in the clinic for CS with glare. Lighting was the most significant factor associated with differences in vision between the clinic and home for DVA, NVA, and CS with glare testing (P < .05, multiple regression model). Median home lighting was 4.3 times and 2.8 times lower than clinic lighting in areas tested for DVA and NVA, respectively. Home lighting was below that recommended in 85% or greater of participants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vision measured in the clinic is generally better than vision measured at home, with differences mainly owing to poor home lighting. Knowledge that vision discrepancies between patient report and clinical testing may be owing to home lighting may initiate clinician-patient discussions to optimize home lighting and improve the vision of older adults in their homes.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Contrast Sensitivity/physiology Cross-Sectional Studies Female Glare Glaucoma/*physiopathology *House Calls Humans Light *Lighting Male Middle Aged *Outpatient Clinics, Hospital Pilot Projects Quality of Life Questionnaires Vision Disorders/*physiopathology Vision, Binocular/*physiology Vision, Ocular Visual Acuity/*physiology Visual Fields/physiology"
24191089,Scope-of-practice laws for nurse practitioners limit cost savings that can be achieved in retail clinics.,Health Aff (Millwood),Spetz J and Parente ST and Town RJ and Bazarko D,Missing,"Retail clinics have the potential to reduce health spending by offering convenient, low-cost access to basic health care services. Retail clinics are often staffed by nurse practitioners (NPs), whose services are regulated by state scope-of-practice regulations. By limiting NPs' work scope, restrictive regulations could affect possible cost savings. Using multistate insurance claims data from 2004-07, a period in which many retail clinics opened, we analyzed whether the cost per episode associated with the use of retail clinics was lower in states where NPs are allowed to practice independently and to prescribe independently. We also examined whether retail clinic use and scope of practice were associated with emergency department visits and hospitalizations. We found that visits to retail clinics were associated with lower costs per episode, compared to episodes of care that did not begin with a retail clinic visit, and the costs were even lower when NPs practiced independently. Eliminating restrictions on NPs' scope of practice could have a large impact on the cost savings that can be achieved by retail clinics.",Ambulatory Care Facilities/economics/legislation & jurisprudence/*manpower Health Services Accessibility/*economics/*legislation & jurisprudence Humans Nurse Practitioners/*economics/*legislation & jurisprudence *Nurse's Role Primary Health Care/economics/legislation & jurisprudence/*manpower Professional Practice/*economics/*legislation & jurisprudence State Government United States

DESIGN: Nested case-control study. SETTING: UK Primary Care Patients registered on the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). PARTICIPANTS: All patients aged 18 or over who were prescribed at least two prescriptions of sodium-containing formulations or matched standard formulations of the same drug between January 1987 and December 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Composite primary outcome of incident non-fatal myocardial infarction, incident non-fatal stroke, or vascular death. We performed 1:1 incidence density sampling matched controls using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). For the secondary analyses, cases were patients with the individual components of the primary study composite endpoint of hypertension, incident heart failure, and all cause mortality. RESULTS: 1,292,337 patients were included in the study cohort. Mean follow-up time was 7.23 years. A total of 61,072 patients with an incident cardiovascular event were matched with controls. For the primary endpoint of incident non-fatal myocardial infarction, incident non-fatal stroke, or vascular death the adjusted odds ratio for exposure to sodium-containing drugs was 1.16 (95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.21). The adjusted odds ratios for the secondary endpoints were 1.22 (1.16 to 1.29) for incident non-fatal stroke, 1.28 (1.23 to 1.33) for all cause mortality, 7.18 (6.74 to 7.65) for hypertension, 0.98 (0.93 to 1.04) for heart failure, 0.94 (0.88 to 1.00) for incident non-fatal myocardial infarction, and 0.70 (0.31 to 1.59) for vascular death. The median time from date of first prescription (that is, date of entry into cohort) to first event was 3.92 years. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to sodium-containing formulations of effervescent, dispersible, and soluble medicines was associated with significantly increased odds of adverse cardiovascular events compared with standard formulations of those same drugs. Sodium-containing formulations should be prescribed with caution only if the perceived benefits outweigh these risks.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cardiovascular Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies Female Great Britain/epidemiology Humans Incidence Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Nonprescription Drugs/adverse effects/*chemistry Sodium/administration & dosage/*adverse effects"

We analyzed beer, spirits, and alcopop magazine advertisements to determine adherence to federal and voluntary advertising standards. We assessed the efficacy of these standards in curtailing potentially damaging content and protecting public health. Methods. We obtained data from a content analysis of a census of 1795 unique advertising creatives for beer, spirits, and alcopops placed in nationally available magazines between 2008 and 2010. We coded creatives for manifest content and adherence to federal regulations and industry codes. Results. Advertisements largely adhered to existing regulations and codes. We assessed only 23 ads as noncompliant with federal regulations and 38 with industry codes. Content consistent with the codes was, however, often culturally positive in terms of aspirational depictions. In addition, creatives included degrading and sexualized images, promoted risky behavior, and made health claims associated with low-calorie content. Conclusions. Existing codes and regulations are largely followed regarding content but do not adequately protect against content that promotes unhealthy and irresponsible consumption and degrades potentially vulnerable populations in its depictions.

This relationship may be explained by the fact that higher order cognitive functions such as executive functions are called upon while walking. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a cognitive training intervention leads to significant improvements on measures of balance and gait.Method.This randomized trial tested whether cognitive training over 10 weeks improves balance and gait in older adults. Participants were randomly assigned to a computer-based cognitive training intervention or measurement-only control. Outcomes included Timed Up and Go (TUG), gait speed, and gait speed with a cognitive distraction. Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance models with change scores. RESULTS: Participants' (N = 51) average age was 82.7 for those randomized to intervention and 81.1 for those randomized to control. After 10 weeks, intervention group participants performed significantly better than controls on the TUG.

24225447,The effects of bedtime and sleep duration on academic and emotional outcomes in a nationally representative sample of adolescents.,J Adolesc Health,Asarnow LD and McGlinchey E and Harvey AG,berkeley,"PURPOSE: The overall aim of this study was to clarify and better characterize the sleep/circadian patterns of adolescents in a nationally representative sample. METHODS: We used three waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to assess sleep/circadian patterns of 2,700 adolescents in grades seven through 12. RESULTS: Late school year bedtime was associated with shorter total sleep time cross-sectionally, whereas late summertime bedtime was not. Moreover, late school year bedtime was not associated with late summertime bedtime cross-sectionally. Late school year bedtime in Wave I (1994-1995) was associated with worse educational outcomes and emotional distress 6-8 years later. In addition, late summertime bedtime in Wave II (1996) was associated with more emotional distress at Wave III (2001-2002). Short total sleep time was not associated longitudinally with changes in emotional and academic functioning. Across Waves I and II, more than three quarters of adolescents who went to sleep at 11:15 a.m. or later during the school year or 1:30 a.m. or later during the summer reported sleeping fewer than the recommended 9 hours.

24192145,Gag reflex control through acupuncture: a case series.,Acupunct Med,Bilello G and Fregapane A,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Many patients avoid dental appointments because of severe gagging when they have work performed, such as taking impressions. There are several methods known to alleviate gagging, and some studies have suggested that acupuncture may be effective in reducing gag reflex. The aim of the present study therefore was to evaluate whether acupuncture can produce a reduction of the gag reflex. METHODS: A total of 20 patients, aged between 19 and 80 years, with history of gag reflex on taking dental impressions, were recruited. All patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria had an upper and lower dental alginate impression taken without acupuncture, and a second upper and lower alginate impression taken immediately after acupuncture based on traditional Chinese medicine. After each impression, the patients recorded their emetic sensation using a visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: The results showed a significant (p<0.05) reduction in the gag reflex scores after acupuncture. For upper impressions, they fell from 6.8 (1.1) to 1.1 (1.1); and for lower impressions, from 5.45 (1.0) to 0.4 (0.7) (mean (SD)).

These adolescents experience individual and intrafamilial stressors of parental deployment and reintegration, which are directly and indirectly associated with internalizing behaviors. PURPOSE: The present study sought to better understand the influence of parental military connectedness and parental deployment on adolescent mental health. METHODS: Data from the 2011 California Healthy Kids Survey examined feeling sad or hopeless, suicidal ideation, well-being, and depressive symptoms by military connectedness in a subsample (n = 14,299) of seventh-, ninth-, and 11th-grade California adolescents. Cross-classification tables and multiple logistic regression analyses were used. RESULTS: More than 13% of the sample had a parent or sibling in the military. Those with military connections were more likely to report depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. Controlling for grade, gender, and race/ethnicity, reporting any familial deployment compared with no deployments was associated with increasing odds of experiencing sadness or hopelessness, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: Findings emphasize the increased risk of mental health issues among youth with parents (and siblings) in the military. Although deployment-related mental health stressors are less likely during peace, during times of war there is a need for increased screening in primary care and school settings. Systematic referral systems and collaboration with community-based mental health centers will bolster screening and services.",Missing

AIM: To examine the association between NEPA and cardiovascular health at baseline as well as the risk of a first cardiovascular disease (CVD) event and total mortality after 12.5 years. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Every third 60-year-old man and woman in Stockholm County was invited to a health screening study; 4232 individuals participated (78% response rate). At baseline, NEPA and exercise habits were assessed from a self-administrated questionnaire and cardiovascular health was established through physical examinations and laboratory tests. The participants were followed for an average of 12.5 years for the assessment of CVD events and mortality. RESULTS: At baseline, high NEPA was, regardless of regular exercise and compared with low NEPA, associated with more preferable waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides in both sexes and with lower insulin, glucose and fibrinogen levels in men. Moreover, the occurrence of the metabolic syndrome was significantly lower in those with higher NEPA levels in non-exercising and regularly exercising individuals. Furthermore, reporting a high NEPA level, compared with low, was associated with a lower risk of a first CVD event (HR=0.73; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.94) and lower all-cause mortality (0.70; 0.53 to 0.98).

24268711,Parental verbal affection and verbal aggression in childhood differentially influence psychiatric symptoms and wellbeing in young adulthood.,Child Abuse Negl,Polcari A and Rabi K and Bolger E and Teicher MH,Missing,"Previous research has shown that exposure to parental verbal aggression is common and associated with increased levels of depression, anxiety, dissociation, and drug use. A key question that has not been addressed is whether verbal affection from the same or opposite parent can attenuate the effects of verbal aggression. This cross-sectional study examined the effects of parental verbal aggression and affection during childhood on measures of psychopathology and wellbeing in a community sample of 2,518 individuals (18-25 years). Data were analyzed for moderating influences using mixed effect models and for direct and indirect effects using structural equation models. The moderation analysis suggested that high levels of exposure to verbal affection did not mitigate the effects of verbal aggression from the same parent, and high levels of verbal affection from another parent did not generally result in a significant attenuation of the effects of verbal aggression. Structural equation models showed that verbal aggression was predominantly associated with effects on psychiatric symptoms scores, whereas verbal affection was primarily associated with effects on measures of wellbeing. These findings highlight the relatively independent effects of verbal aggression and verbal affection and suggest that the latter may be particularly important in establishing a foundation for emotional and physical wellbeing. These findings also suggest that ridicule, disdain, and humiliation cannot be easily counteracted by praise and warmth from the same or another parent.",Missing
24296284,Childhood family living arrangements and blood pressure in black men: the Howard University Family Study.,Hypertension,Barrington DS and Adeyemo AA and Rotimi CN,nih,"Black men have higher blood pressure (BP) levels and consequently higher prevalence of hypertension compared with men from other ethnic groups in the United States. Socio-familial factors in childhood have been found to play an important role in hypertension, but few studies have examined this relationship among black men. We investigated whether childhood family living arrangements are independently associated with mean BP and hypertension in a cross-sectional sample of 515 unrelated black male participants aged >/=20 years enrolled in the Howard University Family Study between 2001 and 2008. Black men who lived with both parents compared with the reference group of men who never lived with both parents during their lifetime had lower systolic BP (-4.4 mm Hg [95% confidence interval {CI}, -7.84 to -0.96]), pulse pressure (-3.9 mm Hg [95% CI, -6.28 to -1.51]), and mean arterial BP (-2.0 mm Hg [95% CI, -4.44 to 0.51]). This protective effect was more pronounced among men who lived with both parents for 1 to 12 years of their lives; they had decreased systolic BP (-6.5 mm Hg [95% CI, -10.99 to -1.95]), pulse pressure (-5.4 mm Hg [95% CI, -8.48 to -2.28]), mean arterial pressure (-3.3 mm Hg [95% CI, -6.56 to 0.00]), and a 46% decreased odds of developing hypertension (odds ratio=0.54; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.99). No statistically significant associations were found for diastolic BP. These results provide preliminary evidence that childhood family structure exerts a long-term influence on BP among black men.","Adult African Americans/*statistics & numerical data Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Blood Pressure Cross-Sectional Studies Humans Hypertension/drug therapy/*epidemiology Male Middle Aged *Residence Characteristics Risk Factors Socioeconomic Factors United States Young Adult"

DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, double-masked clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1090 participants undergoing penetrating keratoplasty at 80 sites for Fuchs' dystrophy (62%), pseudophakic/aphakic corneal edema (34%), or another corneal endothelial disorder (4%) and followed for up to 12 years. METHODS: Forty-three eye banks provided corneas from donors aged 12 to 75 years, using a randomized approach to assign donor corneas to study participants without respect to recipient factors. Surgery and postoperative care were performed according to the surgeons' usual routines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Graft failure defined as a regraft or, in the absence of a regraft, a cloudy cornea that was sufficiently opaque to compromise vision for 3 consecutive months. RESULTS: In the primary analysis, the 10-year success rate was 77% for 707 corneas from donors aged 12 to 65 years compared with 71% for 383 donors aged 66 to 75 years (difference, +6%; 95% confidence interval, -1 to +12; P = 0.11). When analyzed as a continuous variable, higher donor age was associated with lower graft success beyond the first 5 years (P<0.001). Exploring this association further, we observed that the 10-year success rate was relatively constant for donors aged 34 to 71 years (75%). The success rate was higher for 80 donors aged 12 to 33 years (96%) and lower for 130 donors aged 72 to 75 years (62%). The relative decrease in the success rate with donor ages 72 to 75 years was not observed until after year 6. CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary analysis did not show a significant difference in 10-year success rates comparing donor ages 12 to 65 years and 66 to 75 years, there was evidence of a donor age effect at the extremes of the age range. Because we observed a fairly constant 10-year success rate for donors aged 34 to 71 years, which account for approximately 75% of corneas in the United States available for transplant, the Cornea Donor Study results indicate that donor age is not an important factor in most penetrating keratoplasties for endothelial disease.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors Aged Aging/*physiology Child Corneal Edema/physiopathology/surgery Double-Blind Method Eye Banks Female Follow-Up Studies Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy/physiopathology/*surgery Graft Survival/*physiology Humans *Keratoplasty, Penetrating Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies Registries *Tissue Donors Young Adult"

Few studies have focused on modifications over time of the cognitive function in the healthy elderly. The objective of the present study was to analyze the cognitive function changes of two different samples, born > 15 years apart. METHOD: A first sample of 204 cognitively normal participants was recruited in the memory clinic of Broca hospital between 1991 and 1997. A second sample of 177 cognitively normal participants was recruited in 2008-2009 in the same institution. Both samples were from the same districts of Paris and were assessed with the same neuropsychological test battery. Mean cognitive test scores were compared between 1991 and 2008 samples, between < 80 years old and >/= 80 years old in 1991 and 2008 samples, and finally between subjects < 80 year old of 1991 sample and subjects >/= 80 years old of the 2008 sample. Means were compared with T-tests stratified on gender, age-groups and educational level. RESULTS: Cognitive scores were significantly higher in the 2008 sample. Participants < 80 years old outperformed those >/= 80 in both samples. However, participants < 80 years old in 1991 sample and subjects >/= 80 in the 2008 sample, born on average in 1923, performed mostly identically. CONCLUSION: This study showed a significant increase of cognitive scores over time. Further, contemporary octogenarians in the later sample performed like septuagenarians in the former sample. These findings might be consistent with the increase in life expectancy and life span in good health. The study highlights the necessity to take into account factors which may contaminate and artificially inflate the age-related differences in favor of younger to the older adults.","Aged Aged, 80 and over *Aging *Cognition Cognition Disorders/*physiopathology Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Retrospective Studies"

METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on a sample of 4363 US adults using the 2009 HealthStyles survey. The outcome variable was reading calorie information when available while ordering at fast-food/chain restaurants. Among those who go to fast-food/chain restaurants, we conducted multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between sociodemographic variables and reading calorie information when available. Among those who report reading calorie information when available, we assessed the proportion using calorie information. RESULTS: Among those who reported eating at fast-food/chain restaurants, 36.4% reported reading calorie information when available. Reading calorie information was not related to race/ethnicity, income or education. Compared with men, women had higher odds [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-2.1] of reading calorie information when available while those who frequented fast-food/chain restaurants >/=3 times/week (aOR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.4-0.8) had lower odds compared with those going <4 times/month. Of those who reported reading calorie information when available, 95.4% reported using calorie information at least sometimes.

This is the first meta-analysis that examines the effects of cognitive behavioural group therapies (CBGT) for SAD compared to control on symptoms of anxiety. METHOD: After a systematic literature search in PubMed, Cochrane, PsychINFO and Embase was conducted; eleven studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The studies had to be randomized controlled studies in which individuals with a diagnosed SAD were treated with cognitive-behavioural group therapy (CBGT) and compared with a control group. The overall quality of the studies was moderate. RESULTS: The pooled effect size indicated that the difference between intervention and control conditions was 0.53 (96% CI: 0.33-0.73), in favour of the intervention. This corresponds to a NNT 3.24. Heterogeneity was low to moderately high in all analyses. There was some indication of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that psychological group-treatments CBGT are more effective than control conditions in patients with SAD. Since heterogeneity between studies was high, more research comparing group psychotherapies for SAD to control is needed.","Anxiety Disorders/psychology/*therapy *Cognitive Therapy Female Humans Male *Psychotherapy, Group Social Behavior Disorders/psychology/*therapy"

However, very limited evidence directly supports this statement among adolescents and the sport duration that we should recommend remains unknown. We aimed to determine sport durations that were associated with poor well-being. METHODS: We conducted a survey including 1245 adolescents (16-20 years) from the general Swiss population. Participants were recruited from various settings (sport centres, peers of sport practicing adolescents, websites) and asked to complete a web-based questionnaire. Weekly sport practice was categorised into four groups: low (0-3.5 h), average ( approximately recommended 7 h (3.6-10.5)), high ( approximately 14 h (10.6-17.5)) and very high (>17.5 h). We assessed well-being using the WHO-5 Well-Being Index. RESULTS: Compared with adolescents in the average group, those in the very high group had a higher risk of poor well-being (OR 2.29 (95% CI 1.11 to 4.72)), as did those in the low group (OR 2.33 (1.58 to 3.44)). In contrast, those in the high group had a lower risk of poor well-being than those in the average group (OR 0.46 (0.23 to 0.93)). CONCLUSIONS: We found an inverted, U-shaped relationship between weekly sport practice duration and well-being among adolescents. The peak scores of well-being were around 14 h per week of sport practice, corresponding to twice the recommended 7 h. Practicing higher sport durations was an independent risk factor of poor well-being.",Adolescent Data Collection Exercise/*physiology Female *Health Status Humans Male Questionnaires Sports/*statistics & numerical data Young Adult

OBJECTIVE: to assess the risk of an injury due to a fall among adults aged 60+, 2 years before first-eye cataract surgery, between first-eye surgery and second-eye surgery and 2 years after second-eye surgery. DESIGN: a retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Western Australian Hospital Morbidity Data System and the Western Australian Death Registry. SUBJECTS: there were 28,396 individuals aged 60+ years who underwent bilateral cataract surgery in Western Australia between 2001 and 2008. METHODS: Poisson regression analysis based on generalised estimating equations compared the frequency of falls 2 years before first-eye cataract surgery, between first- and second-eye surgery and 2 years after second-eye cataract surgery after accounting for potential confounders. RESULTS: the risk of an injurious fall that required hospitalisation doubled (risk ratio: 2.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.82 to 2.51) between first- and second-eye cataract surgery compared with the 2 years before first-eye surgery. There was a 34% increase in the number of injurious falls that required hospitalisation in the 2 years after second-eye cataract surgery compared with the 2 years before first-eye surgery (risk ratio: 1.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.16-1.55). CONCLUSIONS: there was an increased risk of injurious falls after first- and second-eye cataract surgery which has implications for the timely provision of second-eye surgery as well as appropriate refractive management between surgeries.",Missing

This study examined the determinants of initial anogenital HPV infection among teenage MSM. METHODS: Two hundred MSM aged 16 to 20 years were recruited via community and other sources. Men were tested for HPV DNA from the anus and penis. RESULTS: The proportion of men with anal HPV of any type increased from 10.0% in men reporting no prior receptive anal sex to 47.3% in men reporting >/= 4 receptive anal sex partners (P < .001).A similar pattern was also seen with HPV type 16 (P = .044). The proportion of men with penile HPV increased from 3.7% in men reporting no prior insertive anal sex to 14.8% in men reporting >/= 4 insertive anal sex partners (P = .014). Overall, 39.0% (95% confidence interval (CI), 32.2%-46.1%) of men had at least 1 HPV type: 23.0% (95% CI, 17.4%-29.5%) had a vaccine-preventable type (6, 11, 16 or 18). CONCLUSIONS: Early and high per partner transmission of HPV occurred between men soon after their first sexual experiences.

We included 252,967 births in 2008-2010 identified in vital records, and we assigned exposure at the residential location by using validated models that accounted for spatial and temporal factors. Estimates of association were adjusted for individual and contextual sociodemographic characteristics and season, using linear mixed models to quantify the predicted change in birth weight in grams related to increasing pollution levels. Adjusted estimates for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mum indicated that for each 10-microg/m(3) increase in exposure, birth weights declined by 18.4, 10.5, 29.7, and 48.4 g for exposures in the first, second, and third trimesters and for the total pregnancy, respectively. Adjusted estimates for nitrogen dioxide indicated that for each 10-ppb increase in exposure, birth weights declined by 14.2, 15.9, 18.0, and 18.0 g for exposures in the first, second, and third trimesters and for the total pregnancy, respectively.

24302705,Change of psychological distress and physical disability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis over the last two decades.,Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken),Overman CL and Jurgens MS and Bossema ER and Jacobs JW and Bijlsma JW and Geenen R,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: During the past decades, a more cautious approach with respect to prescribing medication and physical exercise progressed toward evidence-based guidelines regarding the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Currently, physical activity and other means to improve well-being and functioning are encouraged, and the disease is targeted earlier with more intensive and aggressive pharmacologic treatment. The current study examined whether psychological distress and physical disability in patients with RA reduced over the last 2 decades and whether this is explained by a reduction of disease activity. METHODS: From 1990-2011, consecutive patients with RA (n = 1,151, age range 17-86 years, 68% female, 62% rheumatoid factor positive) were monitored at diagnosis and after 3-5 years of treatment (followup). Depressed mood, anxiety, and physical disability were predicted in multiple linear regression analyses by year of assessment, disease activity, and patient demographics. RESULTS: Over the decades, depressed mood (P = 0.01), anxiety (P = 0.001), and physical disability (P = 0.02) reduced at diagnosis and within-treatment improvement of anxiety (P = 0.04) and physical disability (P < 0.001) increased. Percentages of patients with depressed mood, anxiety, and physical disability at followup changed from 25%, 23%, and 53%, respectively, 2 decades ago to 14%, 12%, and 31%, respectively, currently. After taking account of reduction in disease activity, the decrease in physical disability remained significant (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Over the last 2 decades, psychological distress and physical disability decreased. This favorable trend might partly be due to reduced disease activity. The results indicate that patients with RA have a better opportunity to live a valued life currently than 20 years ago.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*diagnosis/*psychology *Disability Evaluation *Disease Progression Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies Stress, Psychological/*diagnosis/*psychology Young Adult"

However, whether low 25(OH)D is the cause or result of ill health is not known. We did a systematic search of prospective and intervention studies that assessed the effect of 25(OH)D concentrations on non-skeletal health outcomes in individuals aged 18 years or older. We identified 290 prospective cohort studies (279 on disease occurrence or mortality, and 11 on cancer characteristics or survival), and 172 randomised trials of major health outcomes and of physiological parameters related to disease risk or inflammatory status. Investigators of most prospective studies reported moderate to strong inverse associations between 25(OH)D concentrations and cardiovascular diseases, serum lipid concentrations, inflammation, glucose metabolism disorders, weight gain, infectious diseases, multiple sclerosis, mood disorders, declining cognitive function, impaired physical functioning, and all-cause mortality. High 25(OH)D concentrations were not associated with a lower risk of cancer, except colorectal cancer. Results from intervention studies did not show an effect of vitamin D supplementation on disease occurrence, including colorectal cancer. In 34 intervention studies including 2805 individuals with mean 25(OH)D concentration lower than 50 nmol/L at baseline supplementation with 50 mug per day or more did not show better results. Supplementation in elderly people (mainly women) with 20 mug vitamin D per day seemed to slightly reduce all-cause mortality. The discrepancy between observational and intervention studies suggests that low 25(OH)D is a marker of ill health. Inflammatory processes involved in disease occurrence and clinical course would reduce 25(OH)D, which would explain why low vitamin D status is reported in a wide range of disorders. In elderly people, restoration of vitamin D deficits due to ageing and lifestyle changes induced by ill health could explain why low-dose supplementation leads to slight gains in survival.",Missing

However, previous studies are inconclusive and choices for measuring overweight are manifold. OBJECTIVE: To examine two different measures of overweight, body mass index (BMI) and total body fat percentage (TBF%), as risk factors for lower limb injuries in a school-based cohort. STUDY DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort study. METHODS: A total of 632 school children, baseline age 7.7-12.0 years, were investigated. Whole body dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scans provided measures of TBF%. Measures of BMI were obtained by standard anthropometric methods. Musculoskeletal complaints were reported by parents answering weekly mobile phone text messages during 2.5 years. Injuries were diagnosed by clinicians. Leisure time sports participation was reported weekly using text messaging. RESULTS: During 2.5 years of follow-up, 673 lower extremity injuries were diagnosed. Children being overweight by both BMI and TBF% showed the highest risk of sustaining lower extremity injuries (IRR 1.38 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.81)). Children who were overweight using BMI and TBF% showed the highest risk of sustaining lower extremity injuries (IRR 1.38 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.81)). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of lower extremity injuries appeared to be increased for overweight children. When comparing two different measures of overweight, overweight by TBF% is a higher risk factor than overweight by BMI. This suggests that a high proportion of adiposity is more predictive of lower extremity injuries, possibly due to a lower proportion of lean muscle mass.",Missing

However, few studies have examined this relationship longitudinally, and no study has examined the association between change in objective measurements of physical activity resources and change in physical activity in adults. We used longitudinal data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (2000-2007) of 6,814 adults who were aged 45-84 years at baseline. Physical activity was assessed via a semiquantitative questionnaire at baseline and at 2 follow-up visits (approximately 1.6 and 3.2 years later). We measured the density of recreational facilities within 1 mile of each participant's home address and used linear mixed-effects models to estimate the association between change in recreational facility density and change in physical activity. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that a greater increase in recreational density was associated with a less pronounced decline in physical activity (mean difference in annual change in physical activity for each 1-unit increase in recreational density over time = 10.3 (95% confidence interval: 0.7, 19.9)). This association was stronger in older adults. Better access to recreational facilities may benefit middle-aged and older adults by enabling them to maintain activity levels as they age.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Aging *Exercise Female Humans Linear Models Longitudinal Studies Male Middle Aged Public Facilities/*statistics & numerical data Questionnaires *Recreation Residence Characteristics/*statistics & numerical data Self Report"
24265734,Participatory workplace interventions can reduce sedentary time for office workers--a randomised controlled trial.,PLoS One,Parry S and Straker L and Gilson ND and Smith AJ,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Occupational sedentary behaviour is an important contributor to overall sedentary risk. There is limited evidence for effective workplace interventions to reduce occupational sedentary time and increase light activity during work hours. The purpose of the study was to determine if participatory workplace interventions could reduce total sedentary time, sustained sedentary time (bouts >30 minutes), increase the frequency of breaks in sedentary time and promote light intensity activity and moderate/vigorous activity (MVPA) during work hours. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial (ANZCTR NUMBER: ACTN12612000743864) was conducted using clerical, call centre and data processing workers (n = 62, aged 25-59 years) in 3 large government organisations in Perth, Australia. Three groups developed interventions with a participatory approach: 'Active office' (n = 19), 'Active Workstation' and promotion of incidental office activity; 'Traditional physical activity' (n = 14), pedometer challenge to increase activity between productive work time and 'Office ergonomics' (n = 29), computer workstation design and breaking up computer tasks. Accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X, 7 days) determined sedentary time, sustained sedentary time, breaks in sedentary time, light intensity activity and MVPA on work days and during work hours were measured before and following a 12 week intervention period. RESULTS: For all participants there was a significant reduction in sedentary time on work days (-1.6%, p = 0.006) and during work hours (-1.7%, p = 0.014) and a significant increase in number of breaks/sedentary hour on work days (0.64, p = 0.005) and during work hours (0.72, p = 0.015); there was a concurrent significant increase in light activity during work hours (1.5%, p = 0.012) and MVPA on work days (0.6%, p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: This study explored novel ways to modify work practices to reduce occupational sedentary behaviour.

Comparing parent-only interventions with interventions including the child may help determine this. METHODS: A systematic review of published and ongoing studies until 2013, using electronic database and manual searches. Inclusion criteria: randomized controlled trials, overweight/obese children aged 5-12 years, parent-only intervention compared with an intervention that included the child, 6 months or more follow-up. Outcomes included measures of overweight. RESULTS: Ten papers from 6 completed studies, and 2 protocols for ongoing studies, were identified. Parent-only groups are either more effective than or similarly effective as child-only or parent-child interventions, in the change in degree of overweight. Most studies were at unclear risk of bias for randomization, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors. Two trials were at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. Four studies showed higher dropout from parent-only interventions. One study examined programme costs and found parent-only interventions to be cheaper. CONCLUSIONS: Parent-only interventions appear to be as effective as parent-child interventions in the treatment of childhood overweight/obesity, and may be less expensive.

Overall, relational and nonphysical aggression increased from age 11 to age 16, whereas delinquency and physical aggression remained stable. Early puberty was associated with elevated delinquency and physical aggression at age 11. The relationship with early puberty diminished over time for physical aggression but not for delinquency. Best friend's deviant behavior was linked with higher levels of all problem behaviors, but the effect lessened over time for most outcomes. Early puberty was associated with a stronger link between best friend's deviance and delinquency, suggesting increased vulnerability to negative peer influences among early-maturing girls. A similar vulnerability was observed for relational and nonphysical aggression among girls in the ""other"" racial/ethnic minority group only. CONCLUSIONS: Early puberty and friends' deviance may increase the risk of problem behavior in young adolescent girls. Although many of these associations dissipate over time, early-maturing girls are at risk of persistently higher delinquency and stronger negative peer influences.","Adolescent Age of Onset *Aggression/psychology Alabama/epidemiology Child Female *Friends/ethnology/psychology Humans Interviews as Topic *Juvenile Delinquency/ethnology/psychology Likelihood Functions Longitudinal Studies Los Angeles/epidemiology Menarche/ethnology/*psychology Models, Statistical Parents *Peer Group Puberty, Precocious/ethnology/*psychology Regression Analysis Self Report Texas/epidemiology Urban Health/ethnology"
24302466,Exercise programs for people with dementia.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Forbes D and Thiessen EJ and Blake CM and Forbes SC and Forbes S,Missing,"BACKGROUND: This is an update of our previous 2008 review. Several recent trials and systematic reviews of the impact of exercise on people with dementia are reporting promising findings. OBJECTIVES: Primary: Do exercise programs for older people with dementia improve cognition, activities of daily living (ADLs), challenging behaviour, depression, and mortality in older people with dementia?Secondary: Do exercise programs for older people with dementia have an indirect impact on family caregivers' burden, quality of life, and mortality?Do exercise programs for older people with dementia reduce the use of healthcare services (e.g. visits to the emergency department) by participants and their family caregivers? SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials for inclusion in the review by searching ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register, on 4 September 2011, and again on 13 August 2012. The search terms used were: 'physical activity' OR exercise OR cycling OR swim* OR gym* OR walk* OR danc* OR yoga OR 'tai chi'. SELECTION CRITERIA: In this review, we included randomized controlled trials in which older people, diagnosed with dementia, were allocated either to exercise programs or to control groups (usual care or social contact/activities) with the aim of improving cognition, ADLs, behaviour, depression, and mortality. Secondary outcomes related to the family caregiver(s) and included caregiver burden, quality of life, mortality, and use of healthcare services. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Independently, at least two authors assessed the retrieved articles for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. Data were analysed for summary effects using RevMan 5.1 software. We calculated mean differences or standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, and synthesized data for each outcome using a fixed-effect model, unless there was substantial heterogeneity between studies, when we used a random-effects model. We planned to explore heterogeneity in relation to severity and type of dementia, and type, frequency, and duration of exercise program. We also evaluated adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen trials with 937 participants met the inclusion criteria. However, the required data from three trials and some of the data from a fourth trial were not published and not made available. The included trials were highly heterogeneous in terms of subtype and severity of participants' dementia, and type, duration and frequency of exercise. Only two trials included participants living at home. Our meta-analysis suggested that exercise programs might have a significant impact on improving cognitive functioning (eight trials, 329 participants; SMD 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 1.09). However, there was substantial heterogeneity between trials (I(2) value 80%), most of which we were unable to explain. We repeated the analysis omitting one trial, an outlier, that included only participants with moderate or severe dementia. This reduced the heterogeneity somewhat (I(2) value 68%), and produced a result that was no longer significant (seven trials, 308 participants; SMD 0.31, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.74). We found a significant effect of exercise programs on the ability of people with dementia to perform ADLs (six studies, 289 participants; SMD 0.68, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.27). However, again we observed considerable unexplained statistical heterogeneity (I(2) value 77%) in this meta-analysis. This means that there is a need for caution in interpreting these findings. In further analyses, we found that the burden experienced by informal caregivers providing care in the home may be reduced when they supervise the participation of the family member with dementia in an exercise program (one study, 40 participants; MD -15.30, 95% CI -24.73 to -5.87), but we found no significant effect of exercise on challenging behaviours (one study, 110 participants; MD -0.60, 95% CI -4.22 to 3.02), or depression (six studies, 341 participants; MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.07) . We could not examine the remaining outcomes, quality of life, mortality, and healthcare costs, as either the appropriate data were not reported, or we did not retrieve trials that examined these outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is promising evidence that exercise programs can have a significant impact in improving ability to perform ADLs and possibly in improving cognition in people with dementia, although some caution is advised in interpreting these findings. The programs revealed no significant effect on challenging behaviours or depression. There was little or no evidence regarding the remaining outcomes of interest.",Aged Cognition Dementia/psychology/*rehabilitation Depression/rehabilitation Exercise Exercise Therapy/*methods Humans Motor Activity Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Tai Ji Yoga

An amino acid change in the viral neuraminidase associated with drug resistance, NA-R292K (N2 numbering), has been found in some H7N9 clinical isolates. Here we assess the impact of the NA-R292K substitution on antiviral sensitivity and viral replication, pathogenicity and transmissibility of H7N9 viruses. Our data indicate that an H7N9 isolate encoding the NA-R292K substitution is highly resistant to oseltamivir and peramivir and partially resistant to zanamivir. Furthermore, H7N9 reassortants with and without the resistance mutation demonstrate comparable viral replication in primary human respiratory cells, virulence in mice and transmissibility in guinea pigs. Thus, in stark contrast to oseltamivir-resistant seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses, H7N9 virus replication and pathogenicity in these models are not substantially altered by the acquisition of high-level oseltamivir resistance due to the NA-R292K mutation.",Missing
24327038,Proton pump inhibitor and histamine 2 receptor antagonist use and vitamin B12 deficiency.,JAMA,Lam JR and Schneider JL and Zhao W and Corley DA,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) suppress the production of gastric acid and thus may lead to malabsorption of vitamin B12. However, few data exist regarding the associations between long-term exposure to these medications and vitamin B12 deficiency in large population-based studies. OBJECTIVE: To study the association between use of PPIs and H2RAs and vitamin B12 deficiency in a community-based setting in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We evaluated the association between vitamin B12 deficiency and prior use of acid-suppressing medication using a case-control study within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California population. We compared 25,956 patients having incident diagnoses of vitamin B12 deficiency between January 1997 and June 2011 with 184,199 patients without B12 deficiency. Exposures and outcomes were ascertained via electronic pharmacy, laboratory, and diagnostic databases. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk of vitamin B12 deficiency was estimated using odds ratios (ORs) from conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Among patients with incident diagnoses of vitamin B12 deficiency, 3120 (12.0%) were dispensed a 2 or more years' supply of PPIs, 1087 (4.2%) were dispensed a 2 or more years' supply of H2RAs (without any PPI use), and 21,749 (83.8%) had not received prescriptions for either PPIs or H2RAs. Among patients without vitamin B12 deficiency, 13,210 (7.2%) were dispensed a 2 or more years' supply of PPIs, 5897 (3.2%) were dispensed a 2 or more years' supply of H2RAs (without any PPI use), and 165,092 (89.6%) had not received prescriptions for either PPIs or H2RAs. Both a 2 or more years' supply of PPIs (OR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.58-1.73]) and a 2 or more years' supply of H2RAs (OR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.17-1.34]) were associated with an increased risk for vitamin B12 deficiency. Doses more than 1.5 PPI pills/d were more strongly associated with vitamin B12 deficiency (OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.77-2.15]) than were doses less than 0.75 pills/d (OR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.48-1.78]; P = .007 for interaction). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Previous and current gastric acid inhibitor use was significantly associated with the presence of vitamin B12 deficiency. These findings should be considered when balancing the risks and benefits of using these medications.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over California/epidemiology Case-Control Studies Female Health Maintenance Organizations/statistics & numerical data Histamine H2 Antagonists/*therapeutic use Humans Male Middle Aged Odds Ratio Proton Pump Inhibitors/*therapeutic use Risk Vitamin B 12 Deficiency/*epidemiology"

OBJECTIVE: To investigate eye care use among patients with diabetes who were seen in a county hospital clinic that primarily serves high-risk, low-income, non-Hispanic African American patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study with 2 years of follow-up examined eye care use among adult patients with diabetes seen in 2007 in an outpatient medical clinic of a large, urban county hospital that primarily serves low-income, non-Hispanic African American patients. Patients with a history of retinopathy and macular edema or a current diagnosis indicating ophthalmic complications were excluded. Eye care use was defined dichotomously as whether or not patients had a visit to the eye clinic for any eye care examination or procedure. We estimated crude and adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) and 95% CIs for the association between eye care use and selected clinical and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: There were 867 patients with diabetes identified: 61.9% were women, 76.2% were non-Hispanic African American, and 61.4% were indigent, with a mean age of 51.8 years. Eye care utilization rates were 33.2% within 1 and 45.0% within 2 years. For patients aged 19 to 39 years compared with those aged 65 years or older, significantly decreased eye care utilization rates were observed within 1 year (aRR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.27-0.84) and within 2 years (aRR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38-0.99). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Overall eye care utilization rates were low. Additional education efforts to increase the perception of need among urban minority populations may be enhanced if focused on younger persons with diabetes.","Adult African Americans/ethnology Aged Aged, 80 and over Alabama/epidemiology Blindness/ethnology/prevention & control Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*complications/ethnology Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications/ethnology Diabetic Retinopathy/*diagnosis/ethnology/therapy European Continental Ancestry Group/ethnology Female Follow-Up Studies Health Services/*utilization Health Services Research Hospitals, Public/*statistics & numerical data Humans Male Middle Aged *Ophthalmology Outpatient Clinics, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Vision, Low/ethnology/prevention & control Young Adult"
24461314,"Knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors of adults concerning nonalcoholic beverages suggest some lack of comprehension related to sugars.",Nutr Res,Rampersaud GC and Kim H and Gao Z and House LA,ufl,"Key recommendations in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and US Department of Agriculture's MyPlate are to reduce the intake of added sugars, particularly from sugar-sweetened beverages, and drink water instead of ""sugary"" beverages. However, little is known about consumer knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors regarding sugars in beverages. We hypothesized that consumers would have limited or inaccurate knowledge of the sugars in beverages and that their beverage consumption behaviors would not reflect their primary concerns related to sugars in beverages. An online survey was completed by 3361 adults 18 years and older residing throughout the United States. Water was consumed in the highest amounts followed by (in descending amounts) other beverages (includes coffee and tea), added sugar beverages, milk, diet drinks, and 100% fruit juice and blends. Participants primarily associated the term ""sugary"" with beverages containing added sugars; however, almost 40% identified 100% fruit juice as sugary. Some participants misidentified the types of sugars in beverages, particularly with respect to milk and 100% fruit juices. Generally, beverage choices were consistent with stated concerns about total, added, or natural sugars; however, less than 40% of participants identified added sugars as a primary concern when choosing beverages despite public health recommendations to reduce the intake of added sugars and sugar-sweetened beverages. Results suggest that there may be a considerable level of consumer misunderstanding or confusion about the types of sugars in beverages. More consumer research and education are needed with the goal of helping consumers make more informed and healthy beverage choices.","Adolescent Adult Aged Animals *Beverages Choice Behavior *Comprehension *Diet *Dietary Sucrose Energy Intake Female Food Habits Fruit *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Humans Male Middle Aged Milk *Perception *Sweetening Agents Water Young Adult"

There have been actually few studies of tiredness in large general population samples, and where studies do exist, the measures often rely on external assessments. We use a diary-based method to overcome these limitations in a representative sample of U.S. residents. METHODS: Data come from the 2010 American Time Use Survey. Around 13,000 respondents provided a diary about the prior day and rated how tired they felt during selected activities. Regression analysis is used to explain variance in tiredness by age. RESULTS: Regression analysis reveals that tiredness decreases with age. This relationship exists when we control for hours of sleep, gender, self-rated health, ethnic group, number of children, marital status, employment status, level of education, and the amount of time participants spent doing tiring activities.Discussion.Contrary to much previous research, tiredness decreases with age.

METHODS: In a cross-sectional design of the long-term, prospective follow-up study project of 1278 families from a random population sample, the mothers of 15 year-olds were asked to fill in a questionnaire about sleep, health, health related quality of life, and health behavior. RESULTS: Quality of sleep was reported by 32% of women as good, 43% quite good, 12% average, 10% quite poor and 3% as poor. The most frequent sleep disturbance was awakenings in the night, which 60% of the women experienced at least once a week. Difficulty falling asleep and waking too early in the morning were reported as a weekly occurrence by 16% and 20%, respectively. Morning sleepiness was experienced by 42% and daytime sleepiness by 32%. Chronic diseases and use of medications was associated with various sleep disturbances. Both somatic and mental symptoms increased the risk for sleep disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Almost one-quarter of middle-aged women is dissatisfied with their quality of sleep. Women who have chronic disease or use of medications for basic diseases often suffer from sleep disturbance, which is also associated with the health related quality of life. Further analysis of the risk factors is needed to improve the sleep health of middle-aged women.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the rates of positive patch test reactions to allergens on the North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG) standard tray among patients with and without AD and to assess whether atopic patients in our database were more likely to patch test positive to preservatives. METHODS: A total of 2453 patients underwent patch testing to the NACDG standard screening series. The incidence of positive patch test reaction among patients with AD (n = 342) and without AD (n = 2111) was assessed. Statistical analysis was done using a chi(2) test. RESULTS: Compared with nonatopic patients, patients with AD were statistically more likely to have positive patch tests. AD was associated with contact hypersensitivity to quaternium-15, imidazolidinyl urea, DMDM hydantoin, and 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol but not to parabens, formaldehyde, or diazolidinyl urea. LIMITATIONS: Only patients suspected of having allergic contact dermatitis were tested. Our population was geographically limited to metropolitan Kansas City, MO, and metropolitan New York City, NY.

24297836,Is previous history a reliable predictor for acute mountain sickness susceptibility? A meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy.,Br J Sports Med,Macinnis MJ and Lohse KR and Strong JK and Koehle MS,Missing,"PURPOSE: The goal of this meta-analysis was to determine the clinical utility of acute mountain sickness (AMS) history to predict future incidents of AMS. METHOD: 17 studies (n=7921 participants) were included following a systematic review of the literature. A bivariate random-effects model was used to calculate the summary sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test, and moderator variables were tested to explain the heterogeneity across studies. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) method was used to assess concerns for bias and applicability for the included studies. RESULTS: The history of AMS had a low diagnostic accuracy for the prediction of future AMS incidents: the summary sensitivity was 0.50 (95% CI (0.40 to 0.59)) and the summary specificity was 0.72 (95% CI (0.66 to 0.78)). There was significant heterogeneity in the sensitivity and specificity across studies, which we modelled using moderator analysis. Studies that restricted the use of acetazolamide and dexamethasone had not only a higher sensitivity (0.66) relative to those that did not (0.44; p=0.03) but also an increased false-positive rate (0.39 vs 0.23, p=0.03). The QUADAS-2 analysis showed that AMS histories were insufficiently detailed, and few studies controlled for prophylactic medication use or recent altitude exposure, leading to high risks of bias and concerns for applicability. CONCLUSIONS: The use of AMS history to guide prophylactic strategies for high-altitude ascent is not supported by the literature; however, the low sensitivity and specificity of this diagnostic test could reflect the quality of the available studies. Ensuring that the characteristics of the history and future ascents are similar may improve the clinical utility of AMS history.",Missing

Data from the general population are limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 10,000 individuals (mean age 56+/-11 years, 49.4% women) of the population-based Gutenberg Health Study we assessed depression by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and a history of depression in relation to manifest atrial fibrillation (n = 309 cases). The median (25th/75th percentile) PHQ-9 score of depressive symptoms was 4 (2/6) in atrial fibrillation individuals versus 3 (2/6) individuals without atrial fibrillation, P(X2-Test) = 0.32. Multivariable regression analyses of the severity of depressive symptoms in relation to atrial fibrillation in cardiovascular risk factor adjusted models revealed a relation of PHQ-9 values and atrial fibrillation (odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.08; P = 0.023). The association was stronger for the somatic symptom dimension of depression (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.15; P = 0.0085) than for cognitive symptoms (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98-1.11; P = 0.15).

24309196,Energy drinks and alcohol: links to alcohol behaviors and consequences across 56 days.,J Adolesc Health,Patrick ME and Maggs JL,umich,"PURPOSE: To examine short-term consequences associated with consuming alcohol and energy drinks compared with consuming alcohol without energy drinks. METHODS: A longitudinal measurement-burst design (14-day bursts of daily surveys in four consecutive college semesters) captured both within-person variation across occasions and between-person differences across individuals. The analytic sample of late adolescent alcohol users included 4,203 days with alcohol use across up to four semesters per person from 508 college students. RESULTS: Adding energy drink use to a given day with alcohol use was associated with an increase in number of alcoholic drinks, a trend toward more hours spent drinking, elevated estimated blood alcohol content (eBAC), a greater likelihood of subjective intoxication, and more negative consequences of drinking that day. After controlling for eBAC, energy drink use no longer predicted subjective intoxication but was still associated with a greater number of negative consequences. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of energy drinks may lead to increases in alcohol consumption and, after controlling for eBAC, negative consequences. Use of energy drinks plus alcohol represents an emerging threat to public health.",Missing

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (2000-2011), supplemented with expert consultations and hand reviews of reference lists and related citations. DESIGN: Studies reviewed independently and in duplicate were included if reporting mean retail price of foods or diet patterns stratified by healthfulness. We extracted, in duplicate, mean prices and their uncertainties of healthier and less healthy foods/diet patterns and rated the intensity of health differences for each comparison (range 1-10). Prices were adjusted for inflation and the World Bank purchasing power parity, and standardised to the international dollar (defined as US$1) in 2011. Using random effects models, we quantified price differences of healthier versus less healthy options for specific food types, diet patterns and units of price (serving, day and calorie). Statistical heterogeneity was quantified using I(2) statistics. RESULTS: 27 studies from 10 countries met the inclusion criteria. Among food groups, meats/protein had largest price differences: healthier options cost $0.29/serving (95% CI $0.19 to $0.40) and $0.47/200 kcal ($0.42 to $0.53) more than less healthy options. Price differences per serving for healthier versus less healthy foods were smaller among grains ($0.03), dairy (-$0.004), snacks/sweets ($0.12) and fats/oils ($0.02; p<0.05 each) and not significant for soda/juice ($0.11, p=0.64). Comparing extremes (top vs bottom quantile) of food-based diet patterns, healthier diets cost $1.48/day ($1.01 to $1.95) and $1.54/2000 kcal ($1.15 to $1.94) more. Comparing nutrient-based patterns, price per day was not significantly different (top vs bottom quantile: $0.04; p=0.916), whereas price per 2000 kcal was $1.56 ($0.61 to $2.51) more. Adjustment for intensity of differences in healthfulness yielded similar results.

METHODS: A randomised controlled clinical trial was conducted in 91 Koreans (16 male and 75 female, body mass index (BMI)>/=23), who had not received any other weight control treatment within the past 6 months. Subjects were divided randomly into treatment I, treatment II or sham control groups and received unilateral auricular acupuncture with indwelling needles replaced weekly for 8 weeks. Treatment I group received acupuncture at the five ear acupuncture points, treatment II group at the Hunger acupuncture point only and the sham control group received acupuncture at the five ear acupuncture points used in treatment I, but the needles were removed immediately after insertion. BMI, waist circumference, weight, body fat mass (BFM), percentage body fat and blood pressure were measured at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: For the 58 participants who provided data at 8 weeks, significant differences in BMI, weight and BFM were found between the treatment and control groups. Treatment groups I and II showed 6.1% and 5.7% reduction in BMI, respectively (p<0.004). There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups.

METHODS: Subjects aged 10 to 17.9 years with an obstructive apnea hypopnea index <5 underwent polysomnography for 9.5 hours and 24-hour ABP monitoring commencing at noon on the same day. ABP was divided into prepolysomnography, in bed during polysomnography, and postpolysomnography periods for separate analyses. Sleep duration (SpD7) was obtained from a 7-day sleep diary, reflecting the sleep pattern in the week before admission. Total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SpE) were obtained from polysomnography. RESULTS: A total of 143 adolescents participated. SpD7 was inversely associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) in prepolysomnography, in-bed, and postpolysomnography periods (all beta = -2 mm Hg) and with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in prepolysomnography and in-bed periods (all beta = -1 mm Hg). TST was inversely associated with SBP in the postpolysomnography period (beta = -1.5 mm Hg). SpE was inversely associated with SBP in in-bed period (beta = -0.1 mm Hg) and with DBP in in-bed (beta = -0.1 mm Hg) and postpolysomnography (beta = -0.2 mm Hg) periods. Neither TST nor SpE was associated with SBP and DBP in prepolysomnography period. CONCLUSIONS: Short sleep duration as reflected by 7-day sleep diary was associated with higher blood pressure in normal-weight adolescents. Occasional adequate sleep may partially ameliorate the risk of high blood pressure but may not completely reverse the effect of long-term sleep insufficiency.","Adolescent Blood Pressure/*physiology Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory Body Mass Index Child Cohort Studies Female Humans Linear Models Male Polysomnography Sleep/*physiology Time Factors"

Our aim was to measure the association between the focus of pediatric clinical trials and burden of disease and to identify neglected clinical domains. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of clinical trials by using trial records in ClinicalTrials.gov. All trials started in 2006 or after and studying patient-level interventions in pediatric populations were included. Age-specific measures of disease burden were obtained for 21 separate conditions for high-, middle-, and low-income countries. We measured the correlation between number of pediatric clinical trials and disease burden for each condition. RESULTS: Neuropsychiatric conditions and infectious diseases were the most studied conditions globally in terms of number of trials (874 and 847 trials, respectively), while intentional injuries (5 trials) and maternal conditions (4 trials) were the least studied. Clinical trials were only moderately correlated with global disease burden (r = 0.58, P = .006). Correlations were also moderate within each of the country income levels, but lowest in low-income countries (r = .47, P = .03). Globally, the conditions most understudied relative to disease burden were injuries (-260 trials for unintentional injuries and -160 trials for intentional injuries), nutritional deficiencies (-175 trials), and respiratory infections (-171 trials). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric clinical trial activity is only moderately associated with pediatric burden of disease, and least associated in low-income countries. The mismatch between clinical trials and disease burden identifies key clinical areas for focus and investment.","Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Clinical Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data *Cost of Illness Cross-Sectional Studies Developed Countries/*statistics & numerical data Developing Countries/*statistics & numerical data Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Life Tables Pediatrics/*statistics & numerical data Registries World Health"
24335668,Duration of symptoms of respiratory tract infections in children: systematic review.,BMJ,Thompson M and Vodicka TA and Blair PS and Buckley DI and Heneghan C and Hay AD,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the expected duration of symptoms of common respiratory tract infections in children in primary and emergency care. DESIGN: Systematic review of existing literature to determine durations of symptoms of earache, sore throat, cough (including acute cough, bronchiolitis, and croup), and common cold in children. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, DARE, and CINAHL (all to July 2012). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomised controlled trials or observational studies of children with acute respiratory tract infections in primary care or emergency settings in high income countries who received either a control treatment or a placebo or over-the-counter treatment. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias framework for randomised controlled trials, and the critical appraisal skills programme framework for observational studies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Individual study data and, when possible, pooled daily mean proportions and 95% confidence intervals for symptom duration. Symptom duration (in days) at which each symptom had resolved in 50% and 90% of children. RESULTS: Of 22,182 identified references, 23 trials and 25 observational studies met inclusion criteria. Study populations varied in age and duration of symptoms before study onset. In 90% of children, earache was resolved by seven to eight days, sore throat between two and seven days, croup by two days, bronchiolitis by 21 days, acute cough by 25 days, common cold by 15 days, and non-specific respiratory tract infections symptoms by 16 days. CONCLUSIONS: The durations of earache and common colds are considerably longer than current guidance given to parents in the United Kingdom and the United States; for other symptoms such as sore throat, acute cough, bronchiolitis, and croup the current guidance is consistent with our findings. Updating current guidelines with new evidence will help support parents and clinicians in evidence based decision making for children with respiratory tract infections.",Bronchiolitis/pathology Child Cough/pathology Emergency Medical Services Humans Pharyngitis/pathology Primary Health Care Respiratory Tract Infections/*pathology Time Factors

METHODS: This study included 377 adolescents of both sexes, ages 10 to 19 y. Weight, height, body mass index (BMI), bone age, bone mineral content (BMC), and bone mineral density (BMD) were obtained by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The results were adjusted for chronological age and bone age. Comparisons according to nutritional classification were performed by analysis of variance, followed by Tukey test. Linear regression models were used to explain the variation in BMD and BMC in the L1-L4 lumbar spinal region, proximal femur, and whole body in relation to BMI, lean mass, fat mass (FM), and body fat percentage (BF%), considering P < 0.05. RESULTS: For all nutritional groups, average bone age was higher than chronological age. In both sexes, weight and BMI values increased from eutrophic to extremely obese groups, except for BMD and BMC, which did not differ among male adolescents, and were smaller in extremely obese than in obese female adolescents (P < 0.01). Significant differences were observed for FM and BF% values among all nutritional groups (P < 0.01). Positive, moderate to strong correlations were detected between BMD and BMC for BMI, lean mass, and FM. A negative and moderate correlation was found between BMC and BF%, and between BMD and BF% at all bone sites analyzed in males and between BF% and spine and femur BMD, in females. CONCLUSION: The results reveal a negative effect of BF% on bone mass in males and indicate that the higher the BF% among overweight adolescents, the lower the BMD and BMC values.",Missing
24332307,The Confidential Inquiry into premature deaths of people with intellectual disabilities in the UK: a population-based study.,Lancet,Heslop P and Blair PS and Fleming P and Hoghton M and Marriott A and Russ L,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The Confidential Inquiry into premature deaths of people with intellectual disabilities in England was commissioned to provide evidence about contributory factors to avoidable and premature deaths in this population. METHODS: The population-based Confidential Inquiry reviewed the deaths of people with intellectual disabilities aged 4 years and older who had been registered with a general practitioner in one of five Primary Care Trust areas of southwest England, who died between June 1, 2010, and May 31, 2012. A network of health, social-care, and voluntary-sector services; community contacts; and statutory agencies notified the Confidential Inquiry of all deaths of people with intellectual disabilities and provided core data. The Office for National Statistics provided data about the coding of individual cause of death certificates. Deaths were described as avoidable (preventable or amenable), according to Office for National Statistics definitions. Contributory factors to deaths were identified and quantified by the case investigator, verified by a local review panel meeting, and agreed by the Confidential Inquiry overview panel. Contributory factors were grouped into four domains: intrinsic to the individual, within the family and environment, care provision, and service provision. The deaths of a comparator group of people without intellectual disabilities but much the same in age, sex, and cause of death and registered at the same general practices as those with intellectual disabilities were also investigated. FINDINGS: The Confidential Inquiry reviewed the deaths of 247 people with intellectual disabilities. Nearly a quarter (22%, 54) of people with intellectual disabilities were younger than 50 years when they died, and the median age at death was 64 years (IQR 52-75). The median age at death of male individuals with intellectual disabilities was 65 years (IQR 54-76), 13 years younger than the median age at death of male individuals in the general population of England and Wales (78 years). The median age at death of female individuals with intellectual disabilities was 63 years (IQR 54-75), 20 years younger than the median age at death for female individuals in the general population (83 years). Avoidable deaths from causes amenable to change by good quality health care were more common in people with intellectual disabilities (37%, 90 of 244) than in the general population of England and Wales (13%). Contributory factors to premature deaths in a subset of people with intellectual disabilities compared with a comparator group of people without intellectual disabilities included problems in advanced care planning (p=0.0003), adherence to the Mental Capacity Act (p=0.0008), living in inappropriate accommodation (p<0.0001), adjusting care as needs changed (p=0.009), and carers not feeling listened to (p=0.006). INTERPRETATION: The Confidential Inquiry provides evidence of the substantial contribution of factors relating to the provision of care and health services to the health disparities between people with and without intellectual disabilities. It is imperative to examine care and service provision for this population as potentially contributory factors to their deaths--factors that can largely be ameliorated.

It is caused by the loss of ~70,000 posterior hypothalamic neurons that produce the wake-promoting neuropeptide hypocretin (HCRT) (orexin). We identified two DQ0602-binding HCRT epitopes, HCRT56-68 and HCRT87-99, that activated a subpopulation of CD4(+) T cells in narcolepsy patients but not in DQ0602-positive healthy control subjects. Because of the established association of narcolepsy with the 2009 H1N1 influenza A strain (pH1N1), we administered a seasonal influenza vaccine (containing pH1N1) to patients with narcolepsy and found an increased frequency of circulating HCRT56-68- and HCRT87-99-reactive T cells. We also identified a hemagglutinin (HA) pHA1 epitope specific to the 2009 H1N1 strain, pHA1275-287, with homology to HCRT56-68 and HCRT87-99. In vitro stimulation of narcolepsy CD4(+) T cells with pH1N1 proteins or pHA1275-287 increased the frequency of HCRT56-68- and HCRT87-99-reactive T cells. Our data indicate the presence of CD4(+) T cells that are reactive to HCRT in narcolepsy patients and possible molecular mimicry between HCRT and a similar epitope in influenza pH1N1, pHA1275-287.","Adolescent Adult Aged Amino Acid Sequence Antigens, CD38/immunology *Autoimmunity/genetics CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology Case-Control Studies Child Cross Reactions Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/immunology Female HLA-DQ alpha-Chains/genetics HLA-DQ beta-Chains/genetics Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus/genetics/*immunology Humans Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/genetics/*immunology Influenza Vaccines/adverse effects/immunology Influenza, Human/immunology/virology Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*immunology Lymphocyte Activation Male Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology Middle Aged Molecular Mimicry/genetics/immunology Molecular Sequence Data Narcolepsy/etiology/genetics/*immunology Neuropeptides/genetics/*immunology Sequence Homology, Amino Acid Translational Medical Research Twins, Monozygotic Young Adult"

We examined the association between retirement and changes in domain-specific and overall activity and TV viewing. METHODS: Data were derived from the population-based EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer)-Norfolk cohort. Physical activity and TV viewing time were self-reported at baseline (1997-2000) and follow-up 2 (2006-2007) by 3334 participants employed at baseline, of whom 785 (24%) were retired at follow-up 1 (2002-2006). Multivariable regression models were fitted to estimate the association between retirement and changes in physical activity and weekly TV viewing time. RESULTS: Compared with continued employment, retirement was associated with a decline in overall activity (men: non-manual, -40.9 MET h/wk; manual, -49.6 MET h/wk; women: non-manual, -26.9 MET h/wk; manual, -31.6 MET h/wk; all p<0.001 (MET, metabolic equivalent of task)). Domain-specific activity declined for transport and occupational (p<0.001) and increased for recreational (p<0.02) and household (p</=0.002) activity. We observed significant interaction between retirement and social class in respect of overall and domain-specific activity apart from household activity. Retirement was associated with a mean increase in TV viewing time, with the largest increase among manual social classes (men: +3.9 h/wk; women: +2.8 h/wk; both p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Interventions should aim to promote household and transport as well as recreational activity. Further research on the impact of retirement on sedentary behaviour is needed.",Missing
24356113,IFI16 DNA sensor is required for death of lymphoid CD4 T cells abortively infected with HIV.,Science,Monroe KM and Yang Z and Johnson JR and Geng X and Doitsh G and Krogan NJ and Greene WC,Missing,"The progressive depletion of quiescent ""bystander"" CD4 T cells, which are nonpermissive to HIV infection, is a principal driver of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). These cells undergo abortive infection characterized by the cytosolic accumulation of incomplete HIV reverse transcripts. These viral DNAs are sensed by an unidentified host sensor that triggers an innate immune response, leading to caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis. Using unbiased proteomic and targeted biochemical approaches, as well as two independent methods of lentiviral short hairpin RNA-mediated gene knockdown in primary CD4 T cells, we identify interferon-gamma-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) as a host DNA sensor required for CD4 T cell death due to abortive HIV infection. These findings provide insights into a key host pathway that plays a central role in CD4 T cell depletion during disease progression to AIDS.","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology Apoptosis/*immunology CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*virology Cells, Cultured DNA, Viral/*immunology DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/immunology Gene Knockdown Techniques HEK293 Cells HIV-1/*immunology Humans Immunity, Innate Lymphocyte Depletion Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*immunology Palatine Tonsil/immunology Phosphoproteins/genetics/*immunology RNA, Small Interfering/genetics Spleen/immunology"
24306102,The relationship between male BMI and waist circumference on semen quality: data from the LIFE study.,Hum Reprod,Eisenberg ML and Kim S and Chen Z and Sundaram R and Schisterman EF and Buck Louis GM,Missing,"STUDY QUESTION: What is the relationship between body size, physical activity and semen parameters among male partners of couples attempting to become pregnant? SUMMARY ANSWER: Overweight and obesity are associated with a higher prevalence of low ejaculate volume, sperm concentration and total sperm count. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Higher BMI is associated with impaired semen parameters, while increasing waist circumference (WC) is also associated with impaired semen parameters in infertile men. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Data from the Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and the Environment (LIFE) Study were utilized. The LIFE study is a population-based prospective cohort of 501 couples attempting to conceive in two geographic areas (Texas and Michigan, USA) recruited in 2005-2009. Couples were recruited from four counties in Michigan and 12 counties in Texas to ensure a range of environmental exposures and lifestyle characteristics. In person interviews were conducted to ascertain demographic, health and reproductive histories followed by anthropometric assessment. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We categorized BMI (kg/m(2)) as <25.0 (underweight and normal), 25.0-29.9 (overweight) 30.0-34.9 (obese, class I) and >/=35 (obese, class II) for analysis. Data were available for analysis in 468 men (93% participation), with a mean +/- SD age of 31.8 +/- 4.8 years, BMI of 29.8 +/- 5.6 kg/m(2) and WC of 100.8 +/- 14.2 cm. The majority of the cohort (82%) was overweight or obese with 58% reporting physical activity <1 time/week. The median sperm concentration for the men in the cohort was 60.2 M/ml with 8.6% having oligospermia (<15 M/ml). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: When examining semen parameters, ejaculate volume showed a linear decline with increasing BMI and WC (P < 0.01). Similarly, the total sperm count showed a negative linear association with WC (P < 0.01). No significant relationship was seen between body size (i.e. BMI or WC) and semen concentration, motility, vitality, morphology or DNA fragmentation index. The percentage of men with abnormal volume, concentration and total sperm increased with increasing body size (P < 0.05). No relationship between physical activity and semen parameters was identified. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our cohort was largely overweight and sedentary, which may result in limited external validity, i.e. generalizability. The lack of physical activity did preclude examination of exercise more frequently than once per week, thus our ability to examine more active individuals is limited. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Body size (as measured by BMI or WC) is negatively associated with semen parameters with little influence of physical activity. Our findings are the first showing a relationship between WC and semen parameters in a sample of men without known infertility. Given the worldwide obesity epidemic, further study of the role of weight loss to improve semen parameters is warranted.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between reassurance by dental staff and distress behavior of preschool children receiving preventive procedures in a community setting. METHODS: Nurse-child interactions (n = 270) during fluoride varnish application were video recorded and coded. Multilevel logistic regression modeled the probability of the occurrence of child distress behavior as a function of reassurance provision, controlling for child-level and nurse-level variables. RESULTS: Child distress behavior was positively related to nurse verbal reassurance but negatively linked to the time that this reassurance occurred. Both child initial anxiety and nurse nonprocedural training increased the probability of observable distress behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The use of verbal reassurance to promote reception of mild invasive procedures was counterindicated, especially when offered early in the intervention ( ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00881790).",Missing

This study aimed to describe the exposure of children and young adults to alcohol marketing on social media websites in the UK. METHODS: We used commercially available data on the three most used social media websites among young people in the UK, from December 2010 to May 2011. We analysed by age (6-14 years; 15-24 years) and gender the reach (proportion of internet users who used the site in each month) and impressions (number of individual pages viewed on the site in each month) for Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. We further analysed case studies of five alcohol brands to assess the marketer-generated brand content available on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter in February and March 2012. RESULTS: Facebook was the social media site with the highest reach, with an average monthly reach of 89% of males and 91% of females aged 15-24. YouTube had a similar average monthly reach while Twitter had a considerably lower usage in the age groups studied. All five of the alcohol brands studied maintained a Facebook page, Twitter page and YouTube channel, with varying levels of user engagement. Facebook pages could not be accessed by an under-18 user, but in most cases YouTube content and Twitter content could be accessed by those of all ages. CONCLUSION: The rise in online marketing of alcohol and the high use of social media websites by young people suggests that this is an area requiring further monitoring and regulation.",Adolescent *Alcohol Drinking Child Female Great Britain Humans Male Marketing/*methods Social Media/*utilization Young Adult

We investigated whether baseline and change in objectively-assessed ambulatory activity is associated with the risk of a cardiovascular event in individuals at high cardiovascular risk with impaired glucose tolerance. METHODS: We assessed prospective data from the NAVIGATOR trial involving 9306 individuals with impaired glucose tolerance who were recruited in 40 countries between January, 2002, and January, 2004. Participants also either had existing cardiovascular disease (if age >/=50 years) or at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor (if age >/=55 years). Participants were followed-up for cardiovascular events (defined as cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal stroke, or myocardial infarction) for 6 years on average and had ambulatory activity assessed by pedometer at baseline and 12 months. Adjusted Cox proportional hazard models quantified the association of baseline and change in ambulatory activity (from baseline to 12 months) with the risk of a subsequent cardiovascular event, after adjustment for each other and potential confounding variables. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.govNCT00097786. FINDINGS: During 45,211 person-years follow-up, 531 cardiovascular events occurred. Baseline ambulatory activity (hazard ratio [HR] per 2000 steps per day 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.96) and change in ambulatory activity (0.92, 0.86-0.99) were inversely associated with the risk of a cardiovascular event. Results for change in ambulatory activity were unaffected when also adjusted for changes in body-mass index and other potential confounding variables at 12 months.

We aimed to use novel methods to re-evaluate the balance of benefits and harms of aspirin using evidence from randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data sources included ten electronic bibliographic databases, contact with experts, and scrutiny of reference lists of included studies. Searches were undertaken in September 2012 and restricted to publications since 2008. Of 2,572 potentially relevant papers 27 met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of control arms to estimate event rates, modelling of all-cause mortality and L'Abbe plots to estimate heterogeneity were undertaken. Absolute benefits and harms were low: 60-84 major CVD events and 34-36 colorectal cancer deaths per 100,000 person-years were averted, whereas 46-49 major bleeds and 68-117 gastrointestinal bleeds were incurred. Reductions in all-cause mortality were minor and uncertain (Hazard Ratio 0.96; 95% CI: 0.90-1.02 at 20 years, Relative Risk [RR] 0.94, 95% CI: 0.88-1.00 at 8 years); there was a non-significant change in total CVD (RR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.69-1.06) and change in total cancer mortality ranged from 0.76 (95% CI: 0.66-0.88) to 0.93 (95% CI: 0.84-1.03) depending on follow-up time and studies included. Risks were increased by 37% for gastrointestinal bleeds (RR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.15-1.62), 54%-66% for major bleeds (Rate Ratio from IPD analysis 1.54, 95% CI: 1.30-1.82, and RR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.31-2.00), and 32%-38% for haemorrhagic stroke (Rate Ratio from IPD analysis 1.32; 95% CI: 1.00-1.74; RR 1.38; 95% CI: 1.01-1.82). CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate small absolute effects of aspirin relative to the burden of these diseases. When aspirin is used for primary prevention of CVD the absolute harms exceed the benefits.

This passive acceptance may be unnecessarily exposing older people to disability and serious co-morbidity. The aim of this study was to determine the disease burden associated with chronic knee pain and the role of knee extensor strength as a modifiable risk factor. METHODS: a longitudinal cohort study with 2-year follow-up conducted among 1,587 community-dwelling men aged 70 years and over, 637 (40%) reported chronic knee pain. Of the 950 (60%) men without knee pain at baseline, 768 (81%) returned for the follow-up assessment with 150 (20%) reporting incident chronic knee pain. RESULTS: knee pain was significantly associated with marked mobility disability [odds ratio (OR) 2.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.74-3.29], falls (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.01-1.70) and having four or more co-morbidity (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.16-2.30) as well as reduced knee extensor strength and mass (dual X-ray absorptiometry). Men with incident knee pain at the 2-year follow-up assessment demonstrated greater increases in these measures of disease burden and greater decreases in muscle strength and mass, compared with those without incident chronic knee pain. Obesity, high co-morbidity burden, back pain, higher levels of physical activity or low knee extensor strength were all significant risk factors for incident knee pain. CONCLUSION: prevention of chronic knee pain may reduce a considerable burden of mobility disability and increased risk of serious co-morbidity among older men.",Missing
24293370,"Associations between teasing, quality of life, and physical activity among preadolescent children.",J Pediatr Psychol,Jensen CD and Cushing CC and Elledge AR,byu,"OBJECTIVE: This study assessed longitudinal associations between preadolescent's physical activity engagement (PA), health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and teasing during physical activity (TDPA). METHODS: 108 children completed measures of PA, HRQOL, and TDPA during fourth or fifth grade and 1 year later. Potential longitudinal associations between study variables were tested using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Weight status emerged as an important moderator of the structural relationships. TDPA predicted later HRQOL for children with overweight and obesity, whereas HRQOL predicted later PA in children with normal weight. Both groups demonstrated a significant association between TDPA and HRQOL cross-sectionally. CONCLUSIONS: Children with overweight or obesity who experience TDPA are more likely to report poorer subsequent HRQOL. Children with normal weight who experience TDPA are at increased risk for reduced PA 1 year later. Efforts to reduce TDPA may benefit children's HRQOL and increase PA participation.",Missing
24319103,Proposed legislative change mandating retrospective release of identifying information: consultation with donors and Government response.,Hum Reprod,Hammarberg K and Johnson L and Bourne K and Fisher J and Kirkman M,Missing,"STUDY QUESTION: How do gamete donors who presumed they could remain anonymous respond to proposed legislation to retrospectively remove anonymity? SUMMARY ANSWER: A little more than half of the donors opposed the recommendation to introduce legislation to remove donor anonymity with retrospective effect. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: An increasing proportion of parents disclose their origins to their donor-conceived children and growing numbers of donor-conceived adults are aware of how they were conceived. Research indicates that access to information about the donor is important to donor-conceived people. However, worldwide most donor-conceived people are unable to find any identifying information about the donor because of the practice of anonymous gamete donation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This study adopted a qualitative research model using semi-structured interviews with gamete donors that included open questions. Interviews with 42 volunteers were conducted between December 2012 and February 2013. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Before 1998 gamete donors in Victoria, Australia, were able to remain anonymous. Pre-1998 donors were invited through an advertising campaign to be interviewed about their views on a recommendation that legislation mandating retrospective release of identifying information be introduced. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Donors were almost evenly split between those who supported and those who rejected the recommendation to introduce legislation to remove donor anonymity with retrospective effect. About half of the donors who rejected the recommendation suggested the compromise of persuading donors voluntarily to release information (whether identifying or non-identifying) to donor-conceived people. These donors were themselves willing to supply information to their donor offspring. The findings of this study informed the Victorian Government's response to the proposed legislative change. While acknowledging donor-conceived people's right of access to information about their donors, the Government decided that identifying information should be released only with the consent of donors and that donors should be encouraged to allow themselves to be identifiable to their donor offspring. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: There is no way of knowing whether participants were representative of all pre-1998 donors. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The balancing of donors' and donor-conceived people's rights requires utmost sensitivity. All over the world, increasing numbers of donor-conceived people are reaching adulthood; of those who are aware of their mode of conception, some are likely to have a strong wish to know the identity of their donors. Legislators and policy-makers in jurisdictions permitting anonymous gamete donations will need to respond when these desires are expressed, and may choose to be guided by the model of consultation described in this paper.

24352617,"The effectiveness and risks of bariatric surgery: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis, 2003-2012.",JAMA Surg,Chang SH and Stoll CR and Song J and Varela JE and Eagon CJ and Colditz GA,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of obesity and outcomes of bariatric surgery are well established. However, analyses of the surgery impact have not been updated and comprehensively investigated since 2003. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness and risks of bariatric surgery using up-to-date, comprehensive data and appropriate meta-analytic techniques. DATA SOURCES: Literature searches of Medline, Embase, Scopus, Current Contents, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov between 2003 and 2012 were performed. STUDY SELECTION: Exclusion criteria included publication of abstracts only, case reports, letters, comments, or reviews; animal studies; languages other than English; duplicate studies; no surgical intervention; and no population of interest. Inclusion criteria were a report of surgical procedure performed and at least 1 outcome of interest resulting from the studied surgery was reported: comorbidities, mortality, complications, reoperations, or weight loss. Of the 25,060 initially identified articles, 24,023 studies met the exclusion criteria, and 259 met the inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A review protocol was followed throughout. Three reviewers independently reviewed studies, abstracted data, and resolved disagreements by consensus. Studies were evaluated for quality. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mortality, complications, reoperations, weight loss, and remission of obesity-related diseases. RESULTS: A total of 164 studies were included (37 randomized clinical trials and 127 observational studies). Analyses included 161,756 patients with a mean age of 44.56 years and body mass index of 45.62. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses and meta-regression. In randomized clinical trials, the mortality rate within 30 days was 0.08% (95% CI, 0.01%-0.24%); the mortality rate after 30 days was 0.31% (95% CI, 0.01%-0.75%). Body mass index loss at 5 years postsurgery was 12 to 17. The complication rate was 17% (95% CI, 11%-23%), and the reoperation rate was 7% (95% CI, 3%-12%). Gastric bypass was more effective in weight loss but associated with more complications. Adjustable gastric banding had lower mortality and complication rates; yet, the reoperation rate was higher and weight loss was less substantial than gastric bypass. Sleeve gastrectomy appeared to be more effective in weight loss than adjustable gastric banding and comparable with gastric bypass. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Bariatric surgery provides substantial and sustained effects on weight loss and ameliorates obesity-attributable comorbidities in the majority of bariatric patients, although risks of complication, reoperation, and death exist. Death rates were lower than those reported in previous meta-analyses.",Adult *Bariatric Surgery/adverse effects Body Mass Index Humans Obesity/surgery Observational Study as Topic Outcome Assessment (Health Care) Postoperative Complications/epidemiology Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Reoperation/statistics & numerical data Risk Assessment Weight Loss
24439976,Association of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality with prehypertension: a meta-analysis.,Am Heart J,Huang Y and Su L and Cai X and Mai W and Wang S and Hu Y and Wu Y and Tang H and Xu D,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Studies of prehypertension and mortality are controversial after adjusting for other cardiovascular risk factors. This meta-analysis sought to evaluate the association of prehypertension with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases, and conference proceedings were searched for studies with data on prehypertension and mortality. The relative risks (RRs) of all-cause, CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke mortality were calculated and presented with 95% CIs. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to blood pressure, age, gender, ethnicity, follow-up duration, participant number, and study characteristics. RESULTS: Data from 1,129,098 participants were derived from 20 prospective cohort studies. Prehypertension significantly increased the risk of CVD, CHD, and stroke mortality (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.16-1.40; RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.23; and RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.28-1.56, respectively), but did not increase the risk of all-cause mortality after multivariate adjustment (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97-1.10). The difference between CHD mortality and stroke mortality was significant (P < .001). Subgroup analyses showed that CVD mortality was significantly increased in high-range prehypertension (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.16-1.41) but not in low-range prehypertension (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.98-1.18). CONCLUSION: Prehypertension is associated with CVD mortality, especially with stroke mortality, but not with all-cause mortality. The risk for CVD mortality is largely driven by high-range prehypertension.",Blood Pressure/*physiology Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality Cause of Death/trends Humans Prehypertension/*mortality Risk Factors Survival Rate/trends

Treatment of DME has improved dramatically, and the prompt diagnosis of DME and referral of these patients have become more critical. Nonetheless, awareness of and care for DME in the US population is uncharacterized. OBJECTIVE: To characterize eye care and awareness of eye disease among persons with DME in the general US population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analysis of data from participants in the 2005 to 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 40 years or older with diabetes mellitus and fundus photographs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Among persons with DME, (1) awareness that diabetes has affected their eyes; (2) report on the last time they visited a diabetes specialist; (3) report on their last eye examination with pupil dilation; and (4) prevalence of visual impairment. RESULTS: In 2010, only 44.7% (95% CI, 27.0%-62.4%) of US adults 40 years or older with DME reported being told by a physician that diabetes had affected their eyes or that they had retinopathy; 46.7% (95% CI, 27.5%-66.0%), that they had visited a diabetes nurse educator, dietician, or nutritionist for their diabetes mellitus more than 1 year ago or never; and 59.7% (95% CI, 43.5%-75.9%), that they had received an eye examination with pupil dilation in the last year. Among persons with DME, 28.7% (95% CI, 12.7%-44.7%) were visually impaired (defined as visual acuity worse than 20/40 in the eye with DME) based on visual acuity at the initial examination and 16.0% (95% CI, 2.5%-29.4%) based on best-corrected visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Many persons with diabetes mellitus in the United States are not getting care that can prevent visual impairment and blindness. Strategies to increase awareness are warranted, especially given the recent availability of improved therapies for DME.","Cross-Sectional Studies Delivery of Health Care/utilization Diabetic Retinopathy/*diagnosis/epidemiology Female *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Health Services/*utilization Health Services Accessibility Health Services Research Humans Macular Edema/*diagnosis/epidemiology Male Middle Aged Nutrition Surveys Prevalence United States/epidemiology Visual Acuity"

METHODS: The sample consisted of the 8,436 male and 33,586 female participants of the National Walkers' Health Study. Walking energy expenditure was calculated in metabolic equivalents (METs, 1 MET = 3.5 ml O2/kg/min), which were used to divide the cohort into four exercise categories: category 1 (</= 1.07 MET-hours/d), category 2 (1.07 to 1.8 MET-hours/d), category 3 (1.8 to 3.6 MET-hours/d), and category 4 (>/= 3.6 MET-hours/d). Competing risk regression analyses were use to calculate the risk of mortality for categories 2, 3 and 4 relative to category 1. RESULTS: 22.9% of the subjects were in category 1, 16.1% in category 2, 33.3% in category 3, and 27.7% in category 4. There were 2,448 deaths during the 9.6 average years of follow-up. Total mortality was 11.2% lower in category 2 (P = 0.04), 32.4% lower in category 3 (P<10(-12)) and 32.9% lower in category 4 (P = 10(-11)) than in category 1. For underlying causes of death, the respective risk reductions for categories 2, 3 and 4 were 23.6% (P = 0.008), 35.2% (P<10(-5)), and 34.9% (P = 0.0001) for cardiovascular disease mortality; 27.8% (P = 0.18), 20.6% (P = 0.07), and 31.4% (P = 0.009) for ischemic heart disease mortality; and 39.4% (P = 0.18), 63.8% (P = 0.005), and 90.6% (P = 0.002) for diabetes mortality when compared to category 1. For all related mortality (i.e., underlying and contributing causes of death combined), the respective risk reductions for categories 2, 3 and 4 were 18.7% (P = 0.22), 42.5% (P = 0.001), and 57.5% (P = 0.0001) for heart failure; 9.4% (P = 0.56), 44.3% (P = 0.0004), and 33.5% (P = 0.02) for hypertensive diseases; 11.5% (P = 0.38), 41.0% (P<10(-4)), and 35.5% (P = 0.001) for dysrhythmias: and 23.2% (P = 0.13), 45.8% (P = 0.0002), and 41.1% (P = 0.005) for cerebrovascular diseases when compared to category 1.

However, few population-based prospective studies have evaluated dose-response relationships of breastfeeding duration with language and motor development at early ages, and results are discrepant. METHODS: The study uses data from the prospective mother-child cohort ('Rhea' study) in Crete, Greece. 540 mother-child pairs were included in the present analysis. Information about parental and child characteristics and breastfeeding practices was obtained by interview-administered questionnaires. Trained psychologists assessed cognitive, language and motor development by using the Bayley Scales of Infant Toddler Development (3rd edition) at the age of 18 months. RESULTS: Duration of breast feeding was linearly positively associated with all the Bayley scales, except of gross motor. The association persisted after adjustment for potential confounders with an increase of 0.28 points in the scale of cognitive development (beta=0.28; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55), 0.29 points in the scale of receptive communication (beta=0.29; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.54), 0.30 points in the scale of expressive communication (beta=0.30; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.57) and 0.29 points in the scale of fine motor development (beta=0.29; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.56) per accumulated month of breast feeding. Children who were breast fed longer than 6 months had a 4.44-point increase in the scale of fine motor development (beta=4.44; 95% CI 0.06 to 8.82) compared with those never breast fed. CONCLUSIONS: Longer duration of breast feeding was associated with increased scores in cognitive, language and motor development at 18 months of age, independently from a wide range of parental and infant characteristics. Additional longitudinal studies and trials are needed to confirm these results.",Missing

OBJECTIVES: purpose was to investigate whether physical and mental job strain in midlife was associated with hospital care use in old age. METHODS: study population included 5,625 Finnish public sector employees aged 44-58 years who worked in blue- and white-collar professions in 1981. The number of in-patient hospital care days was collected from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register for the 28-year follow-up period. RESULTS: rates of hospital care days per 1,000 person-years for men were 7.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.71-7.84) for low, 9.68 (95% CI 9.50-9.74) for intermediate and 12.56 (95% CI 12.47-12.66) for high physical job strain in midlife. The corresponding rates for women were 6.63 (95% CI 6.57-6.68), 7.91 (95% CI 7.87-7.95) and 10.35 (95% CI 10.25-10.42), respectively. Rates were parallel but lower for mental job strain. Reporting high physical job strain in midlife increased the risk of hospital care in old age compared with those who reported low job strain, fully adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.17 (95% CI 1.00-1.38) for men and 1.42 (95% CI 1.25-1.61) for women. These associations were robust in analyses confined to hospital care that took place after the employees had turned 65 years. CONCLUSION: exposure to high mental and, particularly, high physical job strain in midlife may set employees on a higher healthcare use trajectory which persists into old age.",Missing
24336337,First-line analysis of the effects of treatment on progression of structural changes in knee osteoarthritis over 24 months: data from the osteoarthritis initiative progression cohort.,Ann Rheum Dis,Martel-Pelletier J and Roubille C and Abram F and Hochberg MC and Dorais M and Delorme P and Raynauld JP and Pelletier JP,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To determine, using data from participants enrolled in the progression cohort of the OAI, the effects of conventional osteoarthritis (OA) pharmacological treatment and those of the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate (Glu/CS) on knee structural changes. METHODS: Six hundred patients with knee OA were stratified based on whether or not they received for 24 consecutive months the OA conventional pharmacological treatment and/or Glu/CS. The main outcomes were knee structural changes, including the loss of joint space width (JSW) and of cartilage volume measured by quantitative MRI. RESULTS: Participants reported taking (+) (n=300) or not taking (-) (n=300) OA treatment (analgesic/NSAIDs). The +analgesic/NSAIDs participants had higher Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores (p<0.001) and smaller JSW (p=0.01), reflecting more severe disease at baseline. In the -analgesic/NSAIDs group, participants taking Glu/CS had significantly reduced loss of cartilage volume at 24 months in the medial central plateau (p=0.007). Further subdivision revealed that this effect of Glu/CS occurred in participants with a higher severity of the disease (JSW</=median). In the +analgesic/NSAIDs group, those taking Glu/CS had significantly reduced loss of cartilage volume in the global plateau at 12 months (p=0.05), and in the central plateau at 24 months (p=0.05). These effects occurred in participants with less disease severity (JSW>median). By contrast, no significant reduction in JSW was found between all groups. CONCLUSIONS: In +analgesic/NSAIDs groups and -analgesic/NSAIDs groups, participants who took Glu/CS had reduced loss of cartilage volume over 24 months in subregions when assessed with qMRI, arguing for a disease-modifying effect of Glu/CS which could not be identified by X-rays.",Missing
24366269,Preoperative consultations for medicare patients undergoing cataract surgery.,JAMA Intern Med,Thilen SR and Treggiari MM and Lange JM and Lowy E and Weaver EM and Wijeysundera DN,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Low-risk elective surgical procedures are common, but there are no clear guidelines for when preoperative consultations are required. Such consultations may therefore represent a substantial discretionary service. OBJECTIVE: To assess temporal trends, explanatory factors, and geographic variation for preoperative consultation in Medicare beneficiaries undergoing cataract surgery, a common low-risk elective procedure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort study using a 5% national random sample of Medicare part B claims data including a cohort of 556,637 patients 66 years or older who underwent cataract surgery from 1995 to 2006. Temporal trends in consultations were evaluated within this entire cohort, whereas explanatory factors and geographic variation were evaluated within the 89,817 individuals who underwent surgery from 2005 to 2006. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Separately billed preoperative consultations (performed by family practitioners, general internists, pulmonologists, endocrinologists, cardiologists, nurse practitioners, or anesthesiologists) within 42 days before index surgery. RESULTS: The frequency of preoperative consultations increased from 11.3% in 1998 to 18.4% in 2006. Among individuals who underwent surgery in 2005 to 2006, hierarchical logistic regression modeling found several factors to be associated with preoperative consultation, including increased age (75-84 years vs 66-74 years: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.13]), race (African American race vs other: AOR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.65-0.78]), urban residence (urban residence vs isolated rural town: AOR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.49-1.81]), facility type (outpatient hospital vs ambulatory surgical facility: AOR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.05-1.15]), anesthesia provider (anesthesiologist vs non-medically directed nurse anesthetist: AOR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.10-1.24), and geographic region (Northeast vs South: AOR, 3.09 [95% CI, 2.33-4.10]). The burden of comorbidity was associated with consultation, but the effect size was small (<10%). Variation in frequency of consultation across hospital referral regions was substantial (median [range], 12% [0-69%]), even after accounting for differences in patient-level, anesthesia provider-level, and facility-level characteristics. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Between 1995 and 2006, the frequency of preoperative consultation for cataract surgery increased substantially. Referrals for consultation seem to be primarily driven by nonmedical factors, with substantial geographic variation.","Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over *Cataract Extraction Female Humans Male Medicare *Preoperative Care Referral and Consultation Retrospective Studies Risk Factors United States"

Our study examines the role of parenting on smoking among a highly diverse sample. METHODS: Health surveys were collected from eighth graders (N = 459) in 2 low-income urban schools. Structural equation models examined the direct and indirect effects of authoritative parenting on lifetime smoking. A moderated mediation analysis examined whether indirect effects of authoritative parenting vary among racial/ethnic groups. RESULTS: Authoritative controlling parenting, characterized by limit setting, was positively associated with anti-tobacco parenting. Anti-tobacco parenting was inversely associated with smoking, mediating the relationship between controlling parenting and smoking. There was no evidence that mediation was moderated by race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Parent training, which focuses on setting rules and expectations, can be an important and universal element of smoking prevention programs targeted to youth in diverse communities.",Missing
24376232,Calorie reductions and within-meal calorie compensation in children's meal combos.,Obesity (Silver Spring),Wansink B and Hanks AS,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: What happens if a fast-food restaurant chain lowers the calories in a children's meal bundle (CMB), mainly by reducing the portion size of French fries? This study examines how such changes may influence within-meal selections. Specifically, do lower-calorie changes lead to within-meal calorie compensation? METHODS: Item-level anonymous transaction data were collected for thirty chain-owned representative U.S. restaurants during June, July, and August of 2011 (pre-changes) and 2012 (post-changes) with a focus on transaction records that included a CMB. Mixed-effects, repeated measures estimation techniques were used for the analysis. Outcome measures were the percentage and caloric profile of specific entree items, side items, and beverages purchased in all children selecting meals. RESULTS: The new CMB resulted in selected children's meals that had an average of 18.8% fewer calories (P < 0.001). Additionally, a greater percentage of meals had milk (P < 0.001) compared to the prior year. CONCLUSION: Small changes in the automatic-or default-foods offered or promoted in children's meals can reduce calorie intake and improve the overall nutrition from selected foods as long as there is still an indulgence. Importantly, balancing a meal with smaller portions of favored foods might avoid reactance and overeating. Just as managers have done this in restaurants, parents can do this at home.",Missing
24369341,Neuroanatomical correlates of religiosity and spirituality: a study in adults at high and low familial risk for depression.,JAMA Psychiatry,Miller L and Bansal R and Wickramaratne P and Hao X and Tenke CE and Weissman MM and Peterson BS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: We previously reported a 90% decreased risk in major depression, assessed prospectively, in adult offspring of depressed probands who reported that religion or spirituality was highly important to them. Frequency of church attendance was not significantly related to depression risk. Our previous brain imaging findings in adult offspring in these high-risk families also revealed large expanses of cortical thinning across the lateral surface of the right cerebral hemisphere. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether high-risk adults who reported high importance of religion or spirituality had thicker cortices than those who reported moderate or low importance of religion or spirituality and whether this effect varied by family risk status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal, retrospective cohort, familial study of 103 adults (aged 18-54 years) who were the second- or third-generation offspring of depressed (high familial risk) or nondepressed (low familiar risk) probands (first generation). Religious or spiritual importance and church attendance were assessed at 2 time points during 5 years, and cortical thickness was measured on anatomical images of the brain acquired with magnetic resonance imaging at the second time point. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cortical thickness in the parietal regions by risk status. RESULTS: Importance of religion or spirituality, but not frequency of attendance, was associated with thicker cortices in the left and right parietal and occipital regions, the mesial frontal lobe of the right hemisphere, and the cuneus and precuneus in the left hemisphere, independent of familial risk. In addition, the effects of importance on cortical thickness were significantly stronger in the high-risk than in the low-risk group, particularly along the mesial wall of the left hemisphere, in the same region where we previously reported a significant thinner cortex associated with a familial risk of developing depressive illness. We note that these findings are correlational and therefore do not prove a causal association between importance and cortical thickness. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A thicker cortex associated with a high importance of religion or spirituality may confer resilience to the development of depressive illness in individuals at high familial risk for major depression, possibly by expanding a cortical reserve that counters to some extent the vulnerability that cortical thinning poses for developing familial depressive illness.","Adolescent Adult Cerebral Cortex/anatomy & histology/*pathology Child of Impaired Parents Depressive Disorder, Major/*pathology/psychology Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Longitudinal Studies Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Pedigree *Religion Retrospective Studies Risk *Spirituality Young Adult"
24354731,What's normal? Influencing women's perceptions of normal genitalia: an experiment involving exposure to modified and nonmodified images.,BJOG,Moran C and Lee C,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: Examine women's perceptions of what is 'normal' and 'desirable' in female genital appearance. DESIGN: Experiment with random allocation across three conditions. SETTING: Community. SAMPLE: A total of 97 women aged 18-30 years. METHODS: Women were randomly assigned to view a series of images of (1) surgically modified vulvas or (2) nonmodified vulvas, or (3) no images. They then viewed and rated ten target images of surgically modified vulvas and ten of unmodified vulvas. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women used a four-point Likert scale ('strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree'), to rate each target image for 'looks normal' and 'represents society's ideal'. For each woman, we created two summary scores that represented the extent to which she rated the unmodified vulvas as more 'normal' and more 'society's ideal' than the modified vulvas. RESULTS: For ratings of 'normality,' there was a significant effect for condition (F2,94 = 2.75 P = 0.007, radj2 = 0.082): women who had first viewed the modified images rated the modified target vulvas as more normal than the nonmodified vulvas, significantly different from the control group, who rated them as less normal. For ratings of 'society's ideal', there was again a significant effect for condition (F2,92 = 7.72, P < 0.001, radj2 = 0.125); all three groups rated modified target vulvas as more like society's ideal than the nonmodified target vulvas, with the effect significantly strongest for the women who had viewed the modified images. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to images of modified vulvas may change women's perceptions of what is normal and desirable. This may explain why some healthy women seek labiaplasty.","Adolescent Adult Australia Beauty Body Dysmorphic Disorders/*psychology *Body Image Decision Making Female Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Humans Power (Psychology) Social Perception Surgery, Plastic/*psychology Unnecessary Procedures/*psychology/trends *Vulva/surgery"

METHODS: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the efficacy of low-dose computed tomography, chest radiography, and sputum cytologic evaluation for lung cancer screening in asymptomatic persons who are at average or high risk for lung cancer (current or former smokers) and the benefits and harms of these screening tests and of surgical resection of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. The USPSTF also commissioned modeling studies to provide information about the optimum age at which to begin and end screening, the optimum screening interval, and the relative benefits and harms of different screening strategies. POPULATION: This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. RECOMMENDATION: The USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery.

24378418,Associations between serum cholesterol levels and cerebral amyloidosis.,JAMA Neurol,Reed B and Villeneuve S and Mack W and DeCarli C and Chui HC and Jagust W,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Because deposition of cerebral beta-amyloid (Abeta) seems to be a key initiating event in Alzheimer disease (AD), factors associated with increased deposition are of great interest. Whether elevated serum cholesterol levels act as such a factor is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between serum cholesterol levels and cerebral Abeta during life early in the AD process. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multisite, university medical center-based, cross-sectional analysis of potential associations between contemporaneously assayed total serum cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and cerebral Abeta, measured with carbon C11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography. Seventy-four persons (mean age, 78 years) were recruited via direct outreach in stroke clinics and community senior facilities following a protocol designed to obtain a cohort enriched for cerebrovascular disease and elevated vascular risk. Three patients had mild dementia. All others were clinically normal (n = 33) or had mild cognitive impairment (n = 38). RESULTS: Cerebral Abeta was quantified using a Global PIB Index, which averages PIB retention in cortical areas prone to amyloidosis. Statistical models that controlled for age and the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele revealed independent associations among the levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, and PIB index. Higher LDL-C and lower HDL-C levels were both associated with a higher PIB index. No association was found between the total cholesterol level and PIB index. No association was found between statin use and PIB index, and controlling for cholesterol treatment in the statistical models did not alter the basic findings. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Elevated cerebral Abeta level was associated with cholesterol fractions in a pattern analogous to that found in coronary artery disease. This finding, in living humans, is consistent with prior autopsy reports, epidemiologic findings, and animal and in vitro work, suggesting an important role for cholesterol in Abeta processing. Because cholesterol levels are modifiable, understanding their link to Abeta deposition could potentially and eventually have an effect on retarding the pathologic cascade of AD. These findings suggest that understanding the mechanisms through which serum lipids modulate Abeta could offer new approaches to slowing Abeta deposition and thus to reducing the incidence of AD.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Alzheimer Disease/*blood/radionuclide imaging Amyloid beta-Peptides/*blood Amyloidosis/*blood/radionuclide imaging Cerebral Cortex/metabolism/*radionuclide imaging Cholesterol/*blood Cohort Studies Cross-Sectional Studies Female Humans Male"

The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) concept aims to measure the capacity from all antioxidants in the diet by also taking synergistic effects into account. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between the TAC of the diet and the incidence of age-related cataract in a population-based prospective cohort of middle-aged and elderly women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Questionnaire-based nutrition survey within the prospective Swedish Mammography Cohort study, which included 30,607 women (aged 49-83 years) who were observed for age-related cataract incidence for a mean of 7.7 years. EXPOSURE: The TAC of the diet was estimated using a database of foods analyzed with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Information on incident age-related cataract diagnosis and extraction was collected through linkage to registers in the study area. RESULTS: There were 4309 incident cases of age-related cataracts during the mean 7.7 years of follow-up (234,371 person-years). The multivariable rate ratio in the highest quintile of the TAC of the diet compared with the lowest was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79-0.96; P for trend = .03). The main contributors to dietary TAC in the study population were fruit and vegetables (44.3%), whole grains (17.0%), and coffee (15.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Dietary TAC was inversely associated with the risk of age-related cataract. Future studies examining all antioxidants in the diet in relation to age-related cataract are needed to confirm or refute our findings.","Aged Aged, 80 and over *Aging Antioxidants/*administration & dosage Cataract/diagnosis/*epidemiology/prevention & control Cataract Extraction/statistics & numerical data *Diet Female Follow-Up Studies Food Habits Humans Incidence Middle Aged Nutrition Surveys Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Sweden/epidemiology Women's Health"
24317177,Factors contributing to underuse of radiation among younger women with breast cancer.,J Natl Cancer Inst,Pan IW and Smith BD and Shih YC,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based literature has confirmed the effectiveness of radiation therapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS), especially for young women. However, women with young children may be less likely to be compliant. This study explores factors associated with noncompliance of RT among insured young patients. METHOD: Using the MarketScan Database, we identified the study cohort as women aged 20 to 64 years who had a BCS between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2009, and had continuous enrollment 12 months before and after the date of BCS. Patients who had any radiation claims within a year of BCS were considered compliant. Adjusted odds of compliance were estimated from logistic regressions for the full sample and age-stratified subgroups. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of study findings. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Eighteen thousand one hundred twenty of 21 008 (86.25%) nonmetastatic BCS patients received RT. Among patients aged 20 to 64 years, those with children aged 7 to 12 years, those with children aged 13 to 17 years, and those with no children or children aged 18 years or older were more likely to receive RT than patients with at least one child aged less than 7 years (7-12 years: odds ratio (OR) = 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05 to 1.66, P = .02; 13-17 years: OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.13 to 1.75, P = .002; no children or >/=18 years: OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.13 to 1.68, P = .001). Stratified analyses showed that the above association was primarily driven by women in the youngest age group (aged 20-50). Other important factors included breast cancer quality of care measures, enrollment in health maintenance organizations or capitated preferred provider organizations, travelled to a Census division outside their residence for BCS, and whether patients were primary holders of the insurance policy. CONCLUSIONS: Competing demands from child care can constitute a barrier to complete guideline-concordant breast cancer therapy. Younger patients may be confronted by unique challenges that warrant more attention in future research.","Adult Age Factors Breast Neoplasms/economics/*radiotherapy/*surgery Child Child Rearing Female Health Maintenance Organizations Humans *Insurance Coverage Insurance, Health Logistic Models *Mastectomy, Segmental Middle Aged Odds Ratio *Parenting Patient Compliance/*statistics & numerical data Preferred Provider Organizations Quality of Health Care Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/economics/*utilization United States"

Our objective was to investigate if CVD is associated with an increased risk for cognitive decline and to examine whether hypertension, diabetes, or adiposity modify the effect of CVD on cognitive functioning. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective follow-up of 6455 cognitively intact, postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years old enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS). CVD was determined by self-report. For cognitive decline, we assessed the incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or probable dementia (PD) via modified mini-mental state examination (3 MS) score, neurocognitive, and neuropsychiatric examinations. The median follow-up was 8.4 years. Women with CVD tended to be at increased risk for cognitive decline compared with those free of CVD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.67). Women with myocardial infarction or other vascular disease were at highest risk (HR, 2.10; 95% CI: 1.40, 3.15 or HR, 1.97; 95% CI: 1.34, 2.87). Angina pectoris was moderately associated with cognitive decline (HR 1.45; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.01) whereas no significant relationships were found for atrial fibrillation or heart failure. Hypertension and diabetes increased the risk for cognitive decline in women without CVD. Diabetes tended to elevate the risk for MCI/PD in women with CVD. No significant trend was seen for adiposity. CONCLUSIONS: CVD is associated with cognitive decline in elderly postmenopausal women. Hypertension and diabetes, but not adiposity, are associated with a higher risk for cognitive decline.

Data were drawn from two coordinated, population-based studies of adolescents (Project Eating Among Teens 2010) and their parents (Project Families and Eating Among Teens). Surveys were completed during 2009-2010. Frequent television/movie watching during family meals by youth was reported by 25.5% of parents. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated significantly higher odds of mealtime media use (P<0.05) for girls and older teens. In addition, higher odds of mealtime media use (P<0.05) were also seen among those whose parents had low education levels or were black or Asian; having parental rules about media use significantly reduced these odds. Frequent mealtime media use was significantly associated with lower scores on family communication (P<0.05) and scores indicating less importance placed on mealtimes (P<0.001). Furthermore, frequent mealtime media use was associated with lower odds of serving green salad, fruit, vegetables, 100% juice, and milk at meals, whereas higher odds were seen for serving sugar-sweetened beverages (P<0.05). The ubiquitous use of mealtime media by adolescents and differences by sex, race/ethnicity, age, and parental rules suggest that supporting parents in their efforts to initiate and follow-through on setting mealtime media use rules may be an important public health strategy.",Adolescent *Adolescent Behavior Adolescent Nutritional Physiological Phenomena Adult Cellular Phone Communications Media Computers Cross-Sectional Studies Data Collection Demography *Electronics *Family Characteristics Female *Food Habits Fruit Humans Logistic Models Male Meals Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis *Parent-Child Relations Vegetables
24334205,Interpregnancy intervals: impact of postpartum contraceptive effectiveness and coverage.,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Thiel de Bocanegra H and Chang R and Howell M and Darney P,ca,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the use of contraceptive methods, which was defined by effectiveness, length of coverage, and their association with short interpregnancy intervals, when controlling for provider type and client demographics. STUDY DESIGN: We identified a cohort of 117,644 women from the 2008 California Birth Statistical Master file with second or higher order birth and at least 1 Medicaid (Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment [Family PACT] program or Medi-Cal) claim within 18 months after index birth. We explored the effect of contraceptive method provision on the odds of having an optimal interpregnancy interval and controlled for covariates. RESULTS: The average length of contraceptive coverage was 3.81 months (SD = 4.84). Most women received user-dependent hormonal contraceptives as their most effective contraceptive method (55%; n = 65,103 women) and one-third (33%; n = 39,090 women) had no contraceptive claim. Women who used long-acting reversible contraceptive methods had 3.89 times the odds and women who used user-dependent hormonal methods had 1.89 times the odds of achieving an optimal birth interval compared with women who used barrier methods only; women with no method had 0.66 times the odds. When user-dependent methods are considered, the odds of having an optimal birth interval increased for each additional month of contraceptive coverage by 8% (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.09). Women who were seen by Family PACT or by both Family PACT and Medi-Cal providers had significantly higher odds of optimal birth intervals compared with women who were served by Medi-Cal only. CONCLUSION: To achieve optimal birth spacing and ultimately to improve birth outcomes, attention should be given to contraceptive counseling and access to contraceptive methods in the postpartum period.",Adult *Birth Intervals California Cohort Studies Continental Population Groups Contraception Behavior/*statistics & numerical data Contraceptive Agents/administration & dosage/*supply & distribution Educational Status Female Humans Logistic Models Maternal Age Medicaid *Postpartum Period United States Young Adult
24360247,Frequency and patterns of eating disorder symptoms in early adolescence.,J Adolesc Health,Micali N and Ploubidis G and De Stavola B and Simonoff E and Treasure J,Missing,"PURPOSE: There are still uncertainties about manifestations of early adolescent eating disorders (ED) and their effects. We aimed to determine the prevalence of ED symptoms in early adolescence, derive symptoms dimensions, and determine their effects on social and psychological outcomes and subsequent body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Data on 7,082 adolescents aged 13 years from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were obtained on ED symptoms, resulting impairment and family burden and emotional and behavioral disorders using the parental version of the Developmental and Well-being Assessment. Exploratory structural equation models were used to derive ED symptoms dimensions separately by sex and to relate these to contemporary outcomes (impairment, burden, and emotional and behavioral disorders) and a distal outcome (objective BMI at age 15 years). RESULTS: Extreme levels of fear of weight gain, avoidance of fattening foods, and distress about weight and shape were common among girls (11%). Three ED symptoms dimensions were identified: bingeing/overeating, weight/shape concern and weight-control behaviors, and food restriction. Bingeing/overeating was strongly associated with higher functional impairment, family burden, and comorbid psychopathology. Bingeing/overeating and weight/shape concern and weight-control behaviors predicted higher BMI 2 years later, whereas food restriction predicted lower BMI. These effects did not change when BMI at age 13 years was included in the model. CONCLUSIONS: Eating disorder cognitions are common among young teenage girls. Eating disorder symptoms have adverse cross-sectional and distal consequences, in particular on increasing body weight 2 years later. These findings have important implications for early identification of adolescents engaging in ED behaviors and for obesity prevention.",Missing
24385603,Medicaid increases emergency-department use: evidence from Oregon's Health Insurance Experiment.,Science,Taubman SL and Allen HL and Wright BJ and Baicker K and Finkelstein AN,Missing,"In 2008, Oregon initiated a limited expansion of a Medicaid program for uninsured, low-income adults, drawing names from a waiting list by lottery. This lottery created a rare opportunity to study the effects of Medicaid coverage by using a randomized controlled design. By using the randomization provided by the lottery and emergency-department records from Portland-area hospitals, we studied the emergency department use of about 25,000 lottery participants over about 18 months after the lottery. We found that Medicaid coverage significantly increases overall emergency use by 0.41 visits per person, or 40% relative to an average of 1.02 visits per person in the control group. We found increases in emergency-department visits across a broad range of types of visits, conditions, and subgroups, including increases in visits for conditions that may be most readily treatable in primary care settings.","Adult Ambulatory Care/statistics & numerical data Emergency Service, Hospital/*utilization Female Humans Inpatients/statistics & numerical data Insurance, Health Male Medicaid/*economics *Medically Uninsured Oregon Poverty United States"
24336346,Secondhand exposure to vapors from electronic cigarettes.,Nicotine Tob Res,Czogala J and Goniewicz ML and Fidelus B and Zielinska-Danch W and Travers MJ and Sobczak A,Missing,"INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are designed to generate inhalable nicotine aerosol (vapor). When an e-cigarette user takes a puff, the nicotine solution is heated and the vapor is taken into lungs. Although no sidestream vapor is generated between puffs, some of the mainstream vapor is exhaled by e-cigarette user. The aim of this study was to evaluate the secondhand exposure to nicotine and other tobacco-related toxicants from e-cigarettes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured selected airborne markers of secondhand exposure: nicotine, aerosol particles (PM(2.5)), carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in an exposure chamber. We generated e-cigarette vapor from 3 various brands of e-cigarette using a smoking machine and controlled exposure conditions. We also compared secondhand exposure with e-cigarette vapor and tobacco smoke generated by 5 dual users. RESULTS: The study showed that e-cigarettes are a source of secondhand exposure to nicotine but not to combustion toxicants. The air concentrations of nicotine emitted by various brands of e-cigarettes ranged from 0.82 to 6.23 microg/m(3). The average concentration of nicotine resulting from smoking tobacco cigarettes was 10 times higher than from e-cigarettes (31.60+/-6.91 vs. 3.32+/-2.49 microg/m(3), respectively; p = .0081). CONCLUSIONS: Using an e-cigarette in indoor environments may involuntarily expose nonusers to nicotine but not to toxic tobacco-specific combustion products. More research is needed to evaluate health consequences of secondhand exposure to nicotine, especially among vulnerable populations, including children, pregnant women, and people with cardiovascular conditions.",Missing

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients who presented to a Sports Concussion Clinic within 3 weeks of injury between October 2009 and July 2011. At each visit, patients completed a scale that recorded their average level of cognitive activity since the previous visit. The product of cognitive activity level and days between visits (cognitive activity-days) was calculated and divided into quartiles. Kaplan-Meier Product Limit method was used to generate curves of symptom duration based on cognitive activity level. To adjust for other possible predictors of concussion recovery, we constructed a Cox proportional hazard model with cognitive activity-days as the main predictor. RESULTS: Of the 335 patients included in the study, 62% were male, 19% reported a loss of consciousness, and 37% reported experiencing amnesia at the time of injury. The mean age of participants was 15 years (range, 8-23) and the mean number of previous concussions was 0.76; 39% of athletes had sustained a previous concussion. The mean Post-Concussion Symptom Scale score at the initial visit was 30 (SD, 26). The overall mean duration of symptoms was 43 days (SD, 53). Of all variables assessed, only total symptom burden at initial visit and cognitive activity level were independently associated with duration of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Increased cognitive activity is associated with longer recovery from concussion. This study supports the use of cognitive rest and adds to the current consensus opinion.",Adolescent Athletic Injuries/*psychology Child *Cognition Female Humans Male Post-Concussion Syndrome/*psychology Prospective Studies Time Factors Young Adult
24395939,Moving for medicaid? Recent eligibility expansions did not induce migration from other states.,Health Aff (Millwood),Schwartz AL and Sommers BD,Missing,"Starting in 2014, many low-income adult residents of states that forgo the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid would be eligible for that program if they moved to a state that had chosen to expand its coverage. Some of these people may migrate to receive coverage, thereby increasing costs for states that have expanded the program. This is known as the ""welfare magnet"" hypothesis, a claim that geographic variation in social programs induces the migration of welfare recipients to places with more generous benefits or eligibility. To investigate whether such spillover effects are likely, we used data from the Current Population Survey to examine the migration patterns of low-income people before and after recent expansions of public insurance in Arizona, Maine, Massachusetts, and New York. Using difference-in-differences analysis of migration in expansion and control states, we found no evidence of significant migration effects. Our preferred estimate was precise enough to rule out net migration effects of larger than 1,600 people per year in an expansion state. These results suggest that migration will not be a common way for people to obtain Medicaid coverage under the current expansion and that interstate migration is not likely to be a significant source of costs for states choosing to expand their programs.",Missing
24346322,A multiyear assessment of hookah use prevalence among Florida high school students.,Nicotine Tob Res,Barnett TE and Forrest JR and Porter L and Curbow BA,Missing,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of hookah use among Florida high school students over time. Alternative tobacco products, including hookah, pose a public health threat to tobacco prevention efforts, especially among adolescents. METHODS: Florida Youth Tobacco Survey data, representing all public high school students in the state, were analyzed to assess the prevalence of lifetime and current hookah use and were compared by demographic groups. Multiple years of data (2007-2012) were examined to assess changes over time. RESULTS: During the past 6 years, there was an increase in lifetime hookah use among Florida high school students. While males remained at a higher rate overall, female adolescents increased at a faster rate. Hispanic and non-Hispanic White respondents reported increased trends as well. Current use trends did not change over 4 years, remaining at about 8%. CONCLUSIONS: Hookah is a new tobacco product in the United States that appears attractive to youth, with dramatic increases among the state population. While cigarette use among youth is declining in Florida, the increasing uptake of alternative tobacco products may lessen the overall public health gains for tobacco use. There is a need for continued monitoring of hookah use among the adolescent population, for both prevention and cessation efforts as well as policy interventions to address this emerging trend.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between smoking cessation and the risk of cataract extraction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 44,371 men, participating in the Cohort of Swedish Men, aged 45 to 79 years, who in 1997 completed a self-administered questionnaire on smoking habits and lifestyle factors. The men were followed up from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2009. The cohort was matched with the Swedish National Day-Surgery Register and local registers of cataract extraction in the study area. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident cases of age-related cataract extraction. RESULTS: During 12 years of follow-up, we identified 5713 incident cases of age-related cataract extraction. Smoking intensity and cumulative dose of smoking were associated with an increased risk of cataract extraction (P for trend <.001). Current smokers of more than 15 cigarettes per day had a 42% increased risk of cataract extraction (rate ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.28-1.58) compared with never smokers after adjustment for age and other potential risk factors. Smoking cessation significantly decreased the risk for cataract extraction with time (P for trend <.001). After more than 20 years since stopping smoking, men with a mean smoking intensity of more than 15 cigarettes per day had a 21% increased risk of cataract extraction (rate ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06-1.39) compared with never smokers. Among men who smoked 15 cigarettes or less per day, the effect of smoking cessation was observed earlier, but more than 2 decades after smoking cessation, the risk of cataract extraction did not decrease to the level of never smokers (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.24). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Smoking cessation seems to decrease the risk of cataract extraction with time, although the risk persists for decades. The higher the intensity of smoking, the longer it takes for the increased risk to decline. These findings emphasize the importance of early smoking cessation and preferably the avoidance of smoking.",Aged Cataract/*epidemiology/etiology Cataract Extraction/*statistics & numerical data Follow-Up Studies Humans Life Style Male Middle Aged Prevalence Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Smoking/adverse effects Smoking Cessation/*statistics & numerical data Sweden/epidemiology

Parents reported on their own pain, and catastrophizing about their adolescent's pain. RESULTS: About one quarter of the adolescents and two thirds of parents reported having pain. Parent pain was associated with adolescent pain, somatic symptoms, and pain catastrophizing. Parent catastrophizing was a significant predictor of adolescent somatic symptoms and pain-related disability, beyond the contribution of parent pain. Adolescent catastrophizing mediated the association between parent catastrophizing and adolescent pain-related disability.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the effect of eating speed on energy intake is the same in normal-weight and overweight/obese subjects. DESIGN: The effect of slow and fast eating speed on meal energy intake was assessed in a randomized crossover design. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Thirty-five normal-weight (aged 33.3+/-12.5 years; 14 women and 21 men) subjects and 35 overweight/obese (44.1+/-13.0 years; 22 women and 13 men) subjects were studied on 2 days during lunch in a metabolic kitchen. INTERVENTION: The subjects consumed the same meal, ad libitum, but at different speeds during the two eating conditions. The weight and energy content of the food consumed was assessed. Perceived hunger and fullness were assessed at specific times using visual analog scales. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Effect of eating speed on ad libitum energy intake, eating rate (energy intake/meal duration), energy density (energy intake per gram of food and water consumed), and satiety were assessed by mixed-model repeated measures analysis. RESULTS: Meal energy intake was significantly lower in the normal-weight (804.5+/-438.9 vs 892.6+/-330.2 kcal; P=0.04) but not the overweight/obese (667.3+/-304.1 vs 724.8+/-355.5 kcal; P=0.18) subjects during the slow vs the fast eating condition. Both groups had lower meal energy density (P=0.005 and P=0.001, respectively) and eating rate (P<0.0001 in both groups) during the slow vs the fast eating condition. Both groups reported less hunger (P=0.01 and P=0.03, respectively), and the normal-weight subjects reported more fullness (P=0.02) at 60 minutes after the meal began during the slow compared with the fast eating condition. There was no eating speed by weight status interaction for any of the variables. CONCLUSIONS: Eating slowly significantly lowered meal energy intake in the normal-weight but not in the overweight/obese group. It lowered eating rate and energy density in both groups. Eating slowly led to lower hunger ratings in both groups and increased fullness ratings in the normal-weight group at 60 minutes from when the meal began.",Adult Aged Anthropometry Body Composition Body Mass Index Cross-Over Studies Drinking Energy Intake/*physiology Feeding Behavior/*physiology Female Humans Male Meals Middle Aged Obesity/*physiopathology Overweight/*physiopathology Questionnaires Satiation Time Factors Waist Circumference

Cigarette smoking increases complication risk in surgical patients, but the potential effects of smoking status on perioperative health care costs are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that current and former smoking at the time of admission for inpatient surgery, compared with never smoking, are independently associated with higher incremental health care costs for the surgical episode and the first year after hospital discharge. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based, propensity-matched cohort study, with cohort membership based on smoking status (current smokers, former smokers, and never smokers) was performed at Mayo Clinic in Rochester (a tertiary care center) and included patients at least 18 years old who lived in Olmsted County, Minnesota, for at least 1 year before and after the index surgery. EXPOSURE: Undergoing an inpatient surgical procedure at Mayo Clinic hospitals between April 1, 2008, and December 31, 2009. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Total costs during the index surgical episode and 1 year after hospital discharge, with the latter standardized as costs per month. Costs were measured using the Olmsted County Healthcare Expenditure and Utilization Database, a claims-based database including information on medical resource use, associated charges, and estimated economic costs for patients receiving care at the 2 medical groups (Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center) that provide most medical services within Olmsted County, Minnesota. RESULTS: Propensity matching resulted in 678 matched pairs in the current vs never smoker grouping and 945 pairs in the former vs never smoker grouping. Compared with never smokers, adjusted costs for the index hospitalization did not differ significantly for current or former smokers. However, the adjusted costs in the year after hospitalization were significantly higher for current and former smokers based on regression analysis (predicted monthly difference of $400 [95% CI, $131-$669] and $273 [95% CI, $56-$490] for current and former smokers, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with never smokers, health care costs during the first year after hospital discharge for an inpatient surgical procedure are higher in both former and current smokers, although the cost of the index hospitalization is not affected by smoking status.",Adult Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) Female Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data Hospitalization/economics Humans Male Matched-Pair Analysis Middle Aged Minnesota Perioperative Period/*economics Propensity Score Smoking/*economics

METHODS: One hundred and three runners with neutral or mild pronation were randomly assigned a neutral (Nike Pegasus 28), partial minimalist (Nike Free 3.0 V2) or full minimalist shoe (Vibram 5-Finger Bikila). Runners underwent baseline testing to record training and injury history, as well as selected anthropometric measurements, before starting a 12-week training programme in preparation for a 10 km event. Outcome measures included number of injury events, Foot and Ankle Disability (FADI) scores and visual analogue scale pain rating scales for regional and overall pain with running. RESULTS: 99 runners were included in final analysis with 23 injuries reported; the neutral shoe reporting the fewest injuries (4) and the partial minimalist shoe (12) the most. The partial minimalist shoe reported a significantly higher rate of injury incidence throughout the 12-week period. Runners in the full minimalist group reported greater shin and calf pain. CONCLUSIONS: Running in minimalist footwear appears to increase the likelihood of experiencing an injury, with full minimalist designs specifically increasing pain at the shin and calf.

METHODS: 30 patients with microbiologically confirmed MDR or XDR tuberculosis were treated with single-dose autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs (aimed for 1x10(6) cells per kg), within 4 weeks of the start of antituberculosis-drug treatment in a specialist centre in Minsk, Belarus. Inclusion patients were those with pulmonary tuberculosis confirmed by sputum smear microscopy, culture, or both; MDR or XDR tuberculosis confirmed by drug-susceptibility testing to first-line and second-line drugs; age older than 21 years to 65 years or younger; and absence of lesion compatible with a malignant process or ongoing tuberculosis in organs other than the lungs and pleura. In addition to the inclusion criteria, patients were excluded if they were pregnant, coinfected with HIV, or infected with hepatitis B, C, or both. The primary endpoint was safety measured by MSC-infusion related events; any tuberculosis-related event within the 6 month observation period that related to a worsening of the underlying infectious disease, measured by conversion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture or microscopic examination; or any adverse event defined clinically or by changes in blood haematology and biochemistry variables, measured monthly for 6 months after MSC infusion per protocol. This study is registered with the German Clinical Trials Registry, number DRKS00000763. FINDINGS: The most common (grade 1 or 2) adverse events were high cholesterol levels (14 of 30 patients), nausea (11 of 30 patients), and lymphopenia or diarrhoea (ten of 30 patients). There were no serious adverse events reported. We recorded two grade 3 events that were transitory-ie, increased plasma potassium ion concentrations in one patient and a transitory grade 3 gamma-glutamyltransferase elevation in another patient. INTERPRETATION: MSCs as an adjunct therapy are safe and can now be explored further for the treatment of patients with MDR or XDR tuberculosis in combination with standard drug regimens. Adjunct treatment with MSCs needs to be evaluated in controlled phase 2 trials to assess effects on immune responses and clinical and microbiological outcomes.","Adult Aged Antitubercular Agents/*therapeutic use Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis/surgery Female Humans Infusion Pumps Male *Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects Middle Aged Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*drug effects Republic of Belarus Transplantation, Autologous Treatment Outcome Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant/diagnosis/*surgery Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/diagnosis/*surgery/*therapy"
24308428,The importance of parental beliefs and support for pedometer-measured physical activity on school days and weekend days among Canadian children.,BMC Public Health,Vander Ploeg KA and Kuhle S and Maximova K and McGavock J and Wu B and Veugelers PJ,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Parental influences are essential to the behaviours and physical activity of their children. Our study aimed to determine if parental beliefs and support are associated with children's pedometer measured physical activity levels on school days and weekend days. METHODS: In the spring of 2009 and 2011, we analyzed cross-sectional data from 1,355 grade five students and parents in 30 schools in Alberta, Canada. Parents reported how much they care about exercising, how much they encourage their child to be physically active, and how frequently they engage in physical activities with their child. Physical activity was assessed from step counts obtained from time-stamped pedometers collected over nine consecutive days. RESULTS: Increased parental encouragement was positively associated with boys' and girls' physical activity on school days (Boys: beta = 1373, 95% CI: 606, 2139; Girls: beta = 632, 95% CI: 108, 1155) and girls' physical activity on weekend days (beta = 997, 95% CI: 130, 1864). Increased parental care was positively associated with boys' physical activity on weekend days (beta = 1381, 95% CI: 85, 2676). Increased parental support and engagement was associated with an additional 632-1381 steps/day for children in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Parental care, encouragement and engagement are associated with physical activity levels of children 10-11 years of age. Policy makers and researchers should consider the importance of targeting parents when designing strategies to promote physical activity in children. This is particularly relevant to weekends and holidays when children's activity levels are low.","*Attitude to Health Canada Child Cross-Sectional Studies Female Humans Male Monitoring, Ambulatory/instrumentation *Parent-Child Relations Parents/*psychology Questionnaires Sex Factors Time Factors Walking/*statistics & numerical data"

However, the reasons for this remain debated. Methods: We applied a Cox proportional hazards model to 410 first-episode psychosis patients to investigate the association between gender, patterns of cannabis use, and AOP. Results: Patients with a history of cannabis use presented with their first episode of psychosis at a younger age (mean years = 28.2, SD = 8.0; median years = 27.1) than those who never used cannabis (mean years = 31.4, SD = 9.9; median years = 30.0; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.16-1.74; P < .001). This association remained significant after controlling for gender (HR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.11-1.68; P < .001). Those who had started cannabis at age 15 or younger had an earlier onset of psychosis (mean years = 27.0, SD = 6.2; median years = 26.9) than those who had started after 15 years (mean years = 29.1, SD = 8.5; median years = 27.8; HR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.06-1.84; P = .050). Importantly, subjects who had been using high-potency cannabis (skunk-type) every day had the earliest onset (mean years = 25.2, SD = 6.3; median years = 24.6) compared to never users among all the groups tested (HR = 1.99; 95% CI: 1.50- 2.65; P < .0001); these daily users of high-potency cannabis had an onset an average of 6 years earlier than that of non-cannabis users. Conclusions: Daily use, especially of high-potency cannabis, drives the earlier onset of psychosis in cannabis users.",Missing
24461370,Web- vs. telehealth-based delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: a randomized controlled trial.,Sleep Med,Holmqvist M and Vincent N and Walsh K,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to evaluate and compare two methods of service delivery (web-based and telehealth-based) for chronic insomnia with regard to patient preference, clinical effectiveness, and patient satisfaction. METHODS: Our study was a randomized controlled trial with manualized telehealth- and web-based delivery conditions (nonblinded). The sample comprised 73 adults with chronic insomnia. Participants received web-based delivery from their homes or telehealth-based delivery from a nearby clinic. Both interventions consisted of identical psychoeducation, sleep hygiene and stimulus control instruction, sleep restriction treatment, relaxation training, cognitive therapy, mindfulness meditation, and medication-tapering assistance. RESULTS: Using a linear mixed model analysis, results showed that both delivery methods produced equivalent changes in insomnia severity, with large effect sizes. Attendance patterns favored telehealth, whereas homework adherence and preference data favored web-based delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Web- and telehealth-based delivery are both helpful in treating chronic insomnia in rural-dwelling adults.",Missing

DESIGN: Ten-year follow-up of a randomized, controlled single-blind trial (Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE)) with three intervention groups and a no-contact control group. SETTING: Six U.S. cities. PARTICIPANTS: A volunteer sample of 2,832 persons (mean baseline age 73.6; 26% African American) living independently. INTERVENTION: Ten training sessions for memory, reasoning, or speed of processing; four sessions of booster training 11 and 35 months after initial training. MEASUREMENTS: Objectively measured cognitive abilities and self-reported and performance-based measures of everyday function. RESULTS: Participants in each intervention group reported less difficulty with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) (memory: effect size = 0.48, 99% confidence interval (CI) = 0.12-0.84; reasoning: effect size = 0.38, 99% CI = 0.02-0.74; speed of processing: effect size = 0.36, 99% CI = 0.01-0.72). At a mean age of 82, approximately 60% of trained participants, versus 50% of controls (P < .05), were at or above their baseline level of self-reported IADL function at 10 years. The reasoning and speed-of-processing interventions maintained their effects on their targeted cognitive abilities at 10 years (reasoning: effect size = 0.23, 99% CI = 0.09-0.38; speed of processing: effect size = 0.66, 99% CI = 0.43-0.88). Memory training effects were no longer maintained for memory performance. Booster training produced additional and durable improvement for the reasoning intervention for reasoning performance (effect size = 0.21, 99% CI = 0.01-0.41) and the speed-of-processing intervention for speed-of-processing performance (effect size = 0.62, 99% CI = 0.31-0.93). CONCLUSION: Each Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly cognitive intervention resulted in less decline in self-reported IADL compared with the control group.

24420814,Disparities in age-appropriate child passenger restraint use among children aged 1 to 12 years.,Pediatrics,Macy ML and Cunningham RM and Resnicow K and Freed GL,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: Observed racial disparities in child safety seat use have not accounted for socioeconomic factors. We hypothesized that racial differences in age-appropriate restraint use would be modified by socioeconomic status and child passenger safety information sources. METHODS: A 2-site, cross-sectional tablet-based survey of parents seeking emergency care for their 1- to 12-year-old child was conducted between October 2011 and May 2012. Parents provided self-report of child passenger safety practices, demographic characteristics, and information sources. Direct observation of restraint use was conducted in a subset of children at emergency department discharge. Age-appropriate restraint use was defined by Michigan law. RESULTS: Of the 744 eligible parents, 669 agreed to participate and 601 provided complete responses to key variables. White parents reported higher use of car seats for 1- to 3-year-olds and booster seats for 4- to 7-year-olds compared with nonwhite parents. Regardless of race, <30% of 8- to 12-year-old children who were </=4 feet, 9 inches tall used a booster seat. White parents had higher adjusted odds (3.86, 95% confidence interval 2.27-6.57) of reporting age-appropriate restraint use compared with nonwhite parents, controlling for education, income, information sources, and site. There was substantial agreement (82.6%, kappa = 0.74) between parent report of their child's usual restraint and the observed restraint at emergency department discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts should be directed at eliminating racial disparities in age-appropriate child passenger restraint use for children <8 years. Booster seat use, seat belt use, and rear seating represent opportunities to improve child passenger safety practices among older children.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors Child Child Restraint Systems/*utilization Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Female Humans Infant Male Parents Seat Belts/*utilization Young Adult"
24420806,School-based health promotion and physical activity during and after school hours.,Pediatrics,Vander Ploeg KA and McGavock J and Maximova K and Veugelers PJ,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive school health (CSH) is a multifaceted approach to health promotion. A key objective of CSH is to foster positive health behaviors outside of school. This study examined the 2-year change in physical activity during and after school among students participating in a CSH intervention in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental, pre-post trial with a parallel, nonequivalent control group. Intervention schools had to be located in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. In the spring of 2009 and 2011, pedometer recordings (7 full days) and demographic data were collected from cross-sectional samples of fifth grade students from 10 intervention schools and 20 comparison schools. A total of 1157 students participated in the study. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders and the clustered design. RESULTS: Relative to 2009, children in 2011 were more active on schools days (1172 steps per day; P < .001) and on weekends (1450 steps per day; P < .001). However, the increase in mean steps between 2009 and 2011 was greater in CSH intervention schools than in comparison schools (school days: 1221 steps per day; P = .009; weekends: 2001 steps per day; P = .005). These increases remained significant after adjusting for gender and overweight status. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence of the effectiveness of CSH to affect children's physical activity during and outside of school. Results of this study justify broader implementation of effective CSH interventions for physical activity promotion and obesity prevention in the long term.",Child Female Humans Male *Motor Activity Program Evaluation *School Health Services Time Factors

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 6-week intervention using motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral techniques was designed. Diabetes educators were trained and supported in its delivery to 23 people with IAH (Gold score >/=4). RESULTS: Twelve months postcourse, hypoglycemia awareness had improved (P < 0.001). Median (range) rates of severe hypoglycemia (SH) fell from 3 (0-104) to 0 (0-3) per person per year (P < 0.0001) and moderate from 14 (0-100) to 0 (0-18) per person per 6 weeks (P < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: A pilot intervention targeting motivation and cognitions around hypoglycemia engaged patients with resistant IAH and recurrent SH and was associated with significant improvement, supporting the hypothesis that these factors underpin problematic hypoglycemia.",Missing
25099425,Comparison of media literacy and usual education to prevent tobacco use: a cluster-randomized trial.,J Sch Health,Primack BA and Douglas EL and Land SR and Miller E and Fine MJ,pitt,"BACKGROUND: Media literacy programs have shown potential for reduction of adolescent tobacco use. We aimed to determine if an anti-smoking media literacy curriculum improves students' media literacy and affects factors related to adolescent smoking. METHODS: We recruited 1170 9th-grade students from 64 classrooms in 3 public urban high schools. Students were randomized by classroom to a media literacy curriculum versus a standard educational program. In an intent-to-treat analysis, we used multilevel modeling to determine if changes in study outcomes were associated with the curricular intervention, controlling for baseline student covariates and the clustering of students within classrooms. RESULTS: Among participants, mean age was 14.5 years and 51% were male, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups. Smoking media literacy changed more among intervention participants compared with control participants (0.24 vs. 0.08, p < .001). Compared with controls, intervention students exhibited a greater reduction in the perceived prevalence of smoking (-14.0% vs. -4.6%, p < .001). Among those initially susceptible to smoking, intervention participants more commonly reverted to being nonsusceptible post-intervention (24% vs. 16%, p = .08). CONCLUSIONS: A school-based media literacy curriculum is more effective than a standard educational program in teaching media literacy and improving perceptions of the true prevalence of smoking among adolescents.",Missing

Functional brain imaging data from CLBP patients show functional and structural alterations in areas mediating the attribution of hedonic value to food. Accordingly, we hypothesized that CLBP patients would exhibit alteration in the hedonic perception of highly palatable, calorie-containing foods. CLBP patients and matched healthy controls initially rated their perception of highly palatable puddings of varying fat content and sugary drinks of varying sucrose content without ingesting significant amounts of either stimulus. In a subsequent intake test, hungry participants ingested their preferred pudding ad libitum. Compared to healthy controls, CLBP patients exhibited significantly lower ratings of food pleasure when sampling the fat puddings but not when sampling the sugary drinks. In contrast, the patients' sensory evaluation of these stimuli was not different from those of healthy controls. In addition, whereas in healthy controls caloric intake from pudding closely matched hedonic ratings and decreased hunger after ad libitum pudding intake, such effect was totally abolished in CLBP patients. Our data thus reveal a decoupling between hedonic perception and fat calorie intake in CLBP patents, suggesting altered hedonic perception of fat as a potential mechanism linking CLBP to overeating and obesity.",Missing

This study analyzes the associations between building characteristics, stair prompts, and stair use in large urban worksites. METHODS: Bootstrapped generalized mixed models were used to analyze self-reported stair use, using data from 1348 surveys of city employees and fourteen building assessments conducted in New York City in 2012. RESULTS: 57% of respondents reported climbing >/=1 flights of stairs daily at the workplace. Model results show that stair prompts were associated with a 3.21 increased likelihood of stair use. Naturally lit stairwells and stairwell visibility were also positively associated. Higher floor residency and BMI were negatively related, as were gender, stairwell distance from lobby entrances, the total number of floors in each building, and building averages for BMI and gender. Residual heterogeneity measured by adjusted median odds ratios indicates that buildings can have a moderate effect on the likelihood of stair use beyond those of individual characteristics.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between TBI and premature mortality, particularly by external causes, and determine the role of psychiatric comorbidity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We studied all persons born in 1954 or later in Sweden who received inpatient and outpatient International Classification of Diseases-based diagnoses of TBI from 1969 to 2009 (n = 218,300). We compared mortality rates 6 months or more after TBI to general population controls matched on age and sex (n = 2,163,190) and to unaffected siblings of patients with TBI (n = 150,513). Furthermore, we specifically examined external causes of death (suicide, injury, or assault). We conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate whether mortality rates differed by sex, age at death, severity (including concussion), and different follow-up times after diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of premature death by external causes in patients with TBI compared with general population controls. RESULTS: Among those who survived 6 months after TBI, we found a 3-fold increased odds of mortality (AOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 3.0-3.4) compared with general population controls and an adjusted increased odds of mortality of 2.6 (95% CI, 2.3-2.8) compared with unaffected siblings. Risks of mortality from external causes were elevated, including for suicide (AOR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.9-3.7), injuries (AOR, 4.3; 95% CI, 3.8-4.8), and assault (AOR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.7-5.7). Among those with TBI, absolute rates of death were high in those with any psychiatric or substance abuse comorbidity (3.8% died prematurely) and those with solely substance abuse (6.2%) compared with those without comorbidity (0.5%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Traumatic brain injury is associated with substantially elevated risks of premature mortality, particularly for suicide, injuries, and assaults, even after adjustment for sociodemographic and familial factors. Current clinical guidelines may need revision to reduce mortality risks beyond the first few months after injury and address high rates of psychiatric comorbidity and substance abuse.","Adolescent Adult Brain Injuries/*epidemiology *Cause of Death Child Comorbidity Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Mental Disorders/*epidemiology Middle Aged *Mortality, Premature Severity of Illness Index Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology Suicide/statistics & numerical data Sweden/epidemiology Time Factors Wounds and Injuries/epidemiology Young Adult"

We assessed the effects of retinal gene therapy with an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector encoding REP1 (AAV.REP1) in patients with this disease. METHODS: In a multicentre clinical trial, six male patients (aged 35-63 years) with choroideremia were administered AAV.REP1 (0.6-1.0x10(10) genome particles, subfoveal injection). Visual function tests included best corrected visual acuity, microperimetry, and retinal sensitivity tests for comparison of baseline values with 6 months after surgery. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01461213. FINDINGS: Despite undergoing retinal detachment, which normally reduces vision, two patients with advanced choroideremia who had low baseline best corrected visual acuity gained 21 letters and 11 letters (more than two and four lines of vision). Four other patients with near normal best corrected visual acuity at baseline recovered to within one to three letters. Mean gain in visual acuity overall was 3.8 letters (SE 4.1). Maximal sensitivity measured with dark-adapted microperimetry increased in the treated eyes from 23.0 dB (SE 1.1) at baseline to 25.3 dB (1.3) after treatment (increase 2.3 dB [95% CI 0.8-3.8]). In all patients, over the 6 months, the increase in retinal sensitivity in the treated eyes (mean 1.7 [SE 1.0]) was correlated with the vector dose administered per mm(2) of surviving retina (r=0.82, p=0.04). By contrast, small non-significant reductions (p>0.05) were noted in the control eyes in both maximal sensitivity (-0.8 dB [1.5]) and mean sensitivity (-1.6 dB [0.9]). One patient in whom the vector was not administered to the fovea re-established variable eccentric fixation that included the ectopic island of surviving retinal pigment epithelium that had been exposed to vector. INTERPRETATION: The initial results of this retinal gene therapy trial are consistent with improved rod and cone function that overcome any negative effects of retinal detachment. These findings lend support to further assessment of gene therapy in the treatment of choroideremia and other diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, for which intervention should ideally be applied before the onset of retinal thinning.

However, despite being prime examples of creative thinking, comedy and humour have been largely neglected. AIMS: To test the hypothesis that comedians would resemble other creative individuals in showing a higher level of psychotic characteristics related to both schizophrenia and manic depression. METHOD: A group of comedians (n = 500+) and a control sample of actors (n = 350+) completed an online questionnaire containing the short version of the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE), with scales measuring four dimensions of psychotic traits. Scores were compared with general population norms. RESULTS: Comedians scored significantly above O-LIFE norms on all four scales. Actors also differed from the norms but on only three of the scales. Most striking was the comedians' high score on both introverted anhedonia and extraverted impulsiveness.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the breast cancer-specific survival rates of patients undergoing BCT, mastectomy alone, or mastectomy with radiation using a contemporary cohort of patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed univariate, multivariate logistic regression, and propensity analyses to compare the hazard of death for female patients with early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma treated with BCT, mastectomy alone, or mastectomy with radiation during the period from 1998 to 2008. The data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Early-stage breast cancer was defined as having a tumor size of 4 cm or smaller with 3 or less positive lymph nodes. EXPOSURE: Breast conservation therapy, mastectomy alone, or mastectomy with radiation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hazard of death due to breast cancer for patients undergoing BCT, mastectomy alone, or mastectomy with radiation. RESULTS: A total of 132,149 patients were included in this analysis. Breast conservation therapy was used to treat 70% of patients, mastectomy alone was used to treat 27% of patients, and mastectomy with radiation was used to treat 3% of patients. The 5-year breast cancer-specific survival rates of patients who underwent BCT, a mastectomy alone, or a mastectomy with radiation were 97%, 94%, and 90%, respectively (P < .001); the 10-year breast cancer-specific survival rates were 94%, 90%, and 83%, respectively (P < .001). Multivariate analysis showed that women undergoing BCT had a higher survival rate than those undergoing mastectomy alone (hazard ratio, 1.31; P < .001) or mastectomy with radiation (hazard ratio, 1.47; P < .001). When propensity score stratification was used, the effect of treatment method on survival was similar. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients who underwent BCT have a higher breast cancer-specific survival rate compared with those treated with mastectomy alone or mastectomy with radiation for early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma. Further investigation is warranted to understand what may be contributing to this effect.","Adult Aged Breast Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology/radiotherapy/*surgery Combined Modality Therapy Female Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Lymphatic Metastasis Mastectomy/*mortality Mastectomy, Segmental/mortality Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Propensity Score Proportional Hazards Models SEER Program Survival Analysis"

The aim of our study was to evaluate the association between mean hours of sleep per night, psychologic distress, and behavioral concerns. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of the correlation between the number of hours of sleep per night and the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), the Paykel Suicidal Scale (PSS), and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), was performed on 11,788 pupils (mean age+/-standard deviation [SD], 14.9+/-0.9; 55.8% girls) from 11 different European countries enrolled in the SEYLE (Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe) project. RESULTS: The mean number of reported hours of sleep per night during school days was 7.7 (SD, +/-1.3), with moderate differences across countries (r=0.06; P<.001). A reduced number of sleeping hours (less than the average) was more common in girls (beta=0.10 controlling for age) and older pupils (beta=0.10 controlling for sex). Reduced sleep was found to be associated with increased scores on SDQ subscales of emotional (beta=-0.13) and peer-related problems (beta=-0.06), conduct (beta=-0.07), total SDQ score (beta=-0.07), anxiety (Z-SAS scores, beta=-10), and suicidal ideation (PSS, beta=-0.16). In a multivariate model including all significant variables, older age, emotional and peer-related problems, and suicidal ideation were the variables most strongly associated with reduced sleep hours, though female gender, conduct problems measured by the SDQ, and anxiety only showed modest effects (beta=0.03-0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports evidence that reduced hours of sleep are associated with potentially severe mental health problems in adolescents. Because sleep problems are common among adolescents partly due to maturational processes and changes in sleep patterns, parents, other adults, and adolescents should pay more attention to their sleep patterns and implement interventions, if needed.",Missing

METHODS: Participants were 242 (57% black; 47% boys) healthy adolescents (mean age, 15.7 years). Sleep was measured using self-report and wrist actigraphy over seven consecutive nights. Outcomes were actigraphy-assessed sleep duration and sleep efficiency (SE) for the full week and weekends and weekdays separately, as well as self-reported sleep-wake problems and variability in bedtimes. Linear regression examined the relationship between family structure and sleep, after adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, and depressive symptoms, parental education, family conflict, and financial strain. Race and sex were examined as potential moderators. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, adolescents from single-parent households had poorer SE across the week and shorter sleep duration on weekends. White adolescents from two-parent households had fewer sleep-wake problems and lower bedtime variability, whereas black adolescents from single-parent households had the lowest weekend SE. There were no significant differences in family structure-sex interactions. CONCLUSION: Our findings are the first to demonstrate that single-parent family structure is an independent correlate of sleep problems in adolescents and they highlight the moderating role of race.",Missing
24375324,"The relationship between health-related quality of life, obesity and testosterone levels in older men.",Age Ageing,Glintborg D and Nielsen TL and Wraae K and Hougaard D and Gudex C and Brixen K and Andersen M,Missing,"BACKGROUND: quality of life evaluated by Short-Form 36 (SF-36) is decreased in obesity and hypogonadism, but the importance of regional fat mass is unknown. In the present study, we evaluated associations between SF-36, regional fat deposits and bioavailable testosterone (BioT) in ageing men. METHODS: a population-based cross-sectional study in older men. Data included SF-36 questionnaires with the dimensions such as physical function, role limitations physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social function, role limitations emotional and mental health. Furthermore, waist, lean body mass (measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry), visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) (measured by magnetic resonance imaging) and BioT were established. RESULTS: five hundred and ninety-eight men aged 60-74 years were included. The SF-36 dimensions such as physical function, general health, vitality and role limitations functional were inversely associated with waist and SAT and positively associated with BioT. In multiple regression analysis, waist was the body composition measure with the strongest association with SF-36 dimension scores. CONCLUSION: SF-36 dimension scores were more closely associated with central obesity than with BioT. Clinical trial registration number: www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00155961.",Missing
24430092,Association of high-volume hospitals with greater likelihood of discharge to home following colorectal surgery.,JAMA Surg,Balentine CJ and Naik AD and Robinson CN and Petersen NJ and Chen GJ and Berger DH and Anaya DA,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Discharge disposition is a patient-centered quality metric that reflects differences in quality of life and recovery following surgery. The effect of hospital volume on quality of recovery measured by rates of successful discharge to home remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that patients having colorectal surgery at high-volume hospitals would more likely be discharged to home rather than discharged to skilled rehabilitation facilities to complete recovery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal analysis of 2008 hospital inpatient data to identify patients undergoing colorectal surgery who survived to discharge. The setting was the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the largest all-payer inpatient care database, containing data from more than 1000 hospitals. Participants were 280,644 patients (>/= 18 years) who underwent colorectal resections for benign or malignant disease and survived to discharge. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was discharge to home (with or without home health care) vs discharge to skilled facilities (skilled nursing, short-term recovery, or rehabilitation hospitals or other institutions). The secondary end point was discharge to home with home health care rather than to a skilled facility for patients with postdischarge care needs. Multiple logistic regression using robust standard errors was used to compute the odds ratios of each outcome based on hospital volume, while adjusting for other important variables. RESULTS: The odds of discharge to home vs discharge to skilled facilities were significantly greater in high-volume hospitals compared with low-volume hospitals (odds ratio, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.70-2.56), with an absolute increase of 9%. For patients with postdischarge care needs, high-volume hospitals were less likely than low-volume hospitals to use skilled facilities rather than home health care (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.27-0.45), with an absolute difference of 10%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients having colorectal surgery at high-volume hospitals are significantly more likely to recover and return home after surgery than individuals having operations at low-volume hospitals. This study is the first step in a process of identifying which features of high-volume hospitals contribute toward desirable outcomes. Efforts to identify the reasons for improved recovery at high-volume hospitals can help lower-volume hospitals adopt beneficial practices.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Colectomy/*rehabilitation Colon/surgery Continuity of Patient Care/*organization & administration Female Home Care Services/*utilization *Hospitals, High-Volume/statistics & numerical data Humans Insurance Coverage Logistic Models Male Middle Aged *Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care) Patient Discharge/*statistics & numerical data Postoperative Period Rectum/surgery Skilled Nursing Facilities/utilization"
24445375,Scope and outcomes of surrogate decision making among hospitalized older adults.,JAMA Intern Med,Torke AM and Sachs GA and Helft PR and Montz K and Hui SL and Slaven JE and Callahan CM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Hospitalized older adults often lack decisional capacity, but outside of the intensive care unit and end-of-life care settings, little is known about the frequency of decision making by family members or other surrogates or its implications for hospital care. OBJECTIVE: To describe the scope of surrogate decision making, the hospital course, and outcomes for older adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective, observational study conducted in medicine and medical intensive care unit services of 2 hospitals in 1 Midwestern city in 1083 hospitalized older adults identified by their physicians as requiring major medical decisions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical characteristics, hospital outcomes, nature of major medical decisions, and surrogate involvement. RESULTS: According to physician reports, at 48 hours of hospitalization, 47.4% (95% CI, 44.4%-50.4%) of older adults required at least some surrogate involvement, including 23.0% (20.6%-25.6%) with all decisions made by a surrogate. Among patients who required a surrogate for at least 1 decision within 48 hours, 57.2% required decisions about life-sustaining care (mostly addressing code status), 48.6% about procedures and operations, and 46.9% about discharge planning. Patients who needed a surrogate experienced a more complex hospital course with greater use of ventilators (2.5% of patients who made decisions and 13.2% of patients who required any surrogate decisions; P < .001), artificial nutrition (1.7% of patients and 14.4% of surrogates; P < .001), and length of stay (median, 6 days for patients and 7 days for surrogates; P < .001). They were more likely to be discharged to an extended-care facility (21.2% with patient decisions and 40.9% with surrogate decisions; P < .001) and had higher hospital mortality (0.0% patients and 5.9% surrogates; P < .001). Most surrogates were daughters (58.9%), sons (25.0%), or spouses (20.6%). Overall, only 7.4% had a living will and 25.0% had a health care representative document in the medical record. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Surrogate decision making occurs for nearly half of hospitalized older adults and includes both complete decision making by the surrogate and joint decision making by the patient and surrogate. Surrogates commonly face a broad range of decisions in the intensive care unit and the hospital ward setting. Hospital functions should be redesigned to account for the large and growing role of surrogates, supporting them as they make health care decisions.","*Advance Directives Aged Aged, 80 and over *Decision Making *Family Female *Hospitalization Humans Male Prospective Studies"

To be eligible for inclusion, the patients had to be scheduled for bimaxillary treatment with FOA for an expected duration of at least 1 year. The primary and secondary outcome measures were prevalence and incidence of WSL, as registered from digital photos of the maxillary incisors, canines, and premolars taken before onset and immediately after debonding. The photos were evaluated separately by two blinded and calibrated clinicians using a 4-step score. A random sample of 50 cases was reassessed to check intra- and interexaminer reliability (Kappa = 0.70; 0.74).RESULTS: The use of high-fluoride toothpaste resulted in fewer WSL (P = 0.042) with a prevented fraction of 32%. The lateral incisor was most commonly affected in both groups.CONCLUSION: To prevent WSL during treatment of FOA, daily use of high-fluoride toothpaste may be recommended.",Missing
24415631,Home energy efficiency and radon related risk of lung cancer: modelling study.,BMJ,Milner J and Shrubsole C and Das P and Jones B and Ridley I and Chalabi Z and Hamilton I and Armstrong B and Davies M and Wilkinson P,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of reducing home ventilation as part of household energy efficiency measures on deaths from radon related lung cancer. DESIGN: Modelling study. SETTING: England. INTERVENTION: Home energy efficiency interventions, motivated in part by targets for reducing greenhouse gases, which entail reduction in uncontrolled ventilation in keeping with good practice guidance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Modelled current and future distributions of indoor radon levels for the English housing stock and associated changes in life years due to lung cancer mortality, estimated using life tables. RESULTS: Increasing the air tightness of dwellings (without compensatory purpose-provided ventilation) increased mean indoor radon concentrations by an estimated 56.6%, from 21.2 becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m(3)) to 33.2 Bq/m(3). After the lag in lung cancer onset, this would result in an additional annual burden of 4700 life years lost and (at peak) 278 deaths. The increases in radon levels for the millions of homes that would contribute most of the additional burden are below the threshold at which radon remediation measures are cost effective. Fitting extraction fans and trickle ventilators to restore ventilation will help offset the additional burden but only if the ventilation related energy efficiency gains are lost. Mechanical ventilation systems with heat recovery may lower radon levels and the risk of cancer while maintaining the advantage of energy efficiency for the most airtight dwellings but there is potential for a major adverse impact on health if such systems fail. CONCLUSION: Unless specific remediation is used, reducing the ventilation of dwellings will improve energy efficiency only at the expense of population wide adverse impact on indoor exposure to radon and risk of lung cancer. The implications of this and other consequences of changes to ventilation need to be carefully evaluated to ensure that the desirable health and environmental benefits of home energy efficiency are not compromised by avoidable negative impacts on indoor air quality.","Air Pollutants, Radioactive/*toxicity Air Pollution, Indoor/*adverse effects Carcinogens, Environmental/*toxicity England/epidemiology Government Programs Housing/*standards Humans Lung Neoplasms/*mortality Models, Theoretical Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality Radon/*toxicity Ventilation/standards"
24452504,Potential impact of DSM-5 criteria on autism spectrum disorder prevalence estimates.,JAMA Psychiatry,Maenner MJ and Rice CE and Arneson CL and Cunniff C and Schieve LA and Carpenter LA and Van Naarden Braun K and Kirby RS and Bakian AV and Durkin MS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The DSM-5 contains revised diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from the DSM-IV-TR. Potential impacts of the new criteria on ASD prevalence are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess potential effects of the DSM-5 ASD criteria on ASD prevalence estimation by retrospectively applying the new criteria to population-based surveillance data collected for previous ASD prevalence estimation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional, population-based ASD surveillance based on clinician review of coded behaviors documented in children's medical and educational evaluations from 14 geographically defined areas in the United States participating in the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network in 2006 and 2008. This study included 8-year-old children living in ADDM Network study areas in 2006 or 2008, including 644 883 children under surveillance, of whom 6577 met surveillance ASD case status based on the DSM-IV-TR. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of children meeting ADDM Network ASD criteria based on the DSM-IV-TR who also met DSM-5 criteria; overall prevalence of ASD using DSM-5 criteria. RESULTS: Among the 6577 children classified by the ADDM Network as having ASD based on the DSM-IV-TR, 5339 (81.2%) met DSM-5 ASD criteria. This percentage was similar for boys and girls but higher for those with than without intellectual disability (86.6% and 72.5%, respectively; P < .001). A total of 304 children met DSM-5 ASD criteria but not current ADDM Network ASD case status. Based on these findings, ASD prevalence per 1000 for 2008 would have been 10.0 (95% CI, 9.6-10.3) using DSM-5 criteria compared with the reported prevalence based on DSM-IV-TR criteria of 11.3 (95% CI, 11.0-11.7). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Autism spectrum disorder prevalence estimates will likely be lower under DSM-5 than under DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria, although this effect could be tempered by future adaptation of diagnostic practices and documentation of behaviors to fit the new criteria.","Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/*diagnosis/epidemiology Comorbidity Cross-Sectional Studies *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Female Humans Intellectual Disability/epidemiology Male Population Surveillance Prevalence Retrospective Studies United States/epidemiology"

Day patient treatment (DP) is less expensive and might avoid problems of relapse and readmission by easing the transition from hospital to home. We investigated the safety and efficacy of DP after short inpatient care compared with continued IP. METHODS: For this multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial, we enrolled female patients (aged 11-18 years) with anorexia nervosa from six centres in Germany. Patients were eligible if they had a body-mass index (BMI) below the tenth percentile and it was their first admission to hospital for anorexia nervosa. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence to randomly assign patients to continued IP or DP after 3 weeks of inpatient care (1:1; stratified for age and BMI at admission). The treatment programme and treatment intensity in both study groups were identical. The primary outcome was the increase in BMI between the time of admission and a 12-month follow-up adjusted for age and duration of illness (non-inferiority margin of 0.75 kg/m(2)). Analysis was done by modified intention to treat. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register, number ISRCTN67783402, and the Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien, number DRKS00000101. FINDINGS: Between Feb 2, 2007, to April 27, 2010, we screened 660 patients for eligibility, 172 of whom we randomly allocated to treatment: 85 to IP and 87 to DP. DP was non-inferior to IP with respect to the primary outcome, BMI at the 12-month follow-up (mean difference 0.46 kg/m(2) in favour of DP (95% CI, -0.11 to 1.02; pnon-inferiority<0.0001). The number of treatment-related serious adverse events was similar in both study groups (eight in the IP group, seven in the DP group). Three serious adverse events in the IP group and two in the DP group were related to suicidal ideation; one patient in the DP attempted suicide 3 months after she was discharged. INTERPRETATION: DP after short inpatient care in adolescent patients with non-chronic anorexia nervosa seems no less effective than IP for weight restoration and maintenance during the first year after admission. Thus, DP might be a safe and less costly alternative to IP. Our results justify the broad implementation of this approach.

As genomic testing becomes more common, evaluating alternative delivery approaches becomes increasingly salient. We tested whether telephone delivery of BRCA1/2 genetic counseling was noninferior to in-person delivery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants (women age 21 to 85 years who did not have newly diagnosed or metastatic cancer and lived within a study site catchment area) were randomly assigned to usual care (UC; n = 334) or telephone counseling (TC; n = 335). UC participants received in-person pre- and post-test counseling; TC participants completed all counseling by telephone. Primary outcomes were knowledge, satisfaction, decision conflict, distress, and quality of life; secondary outcomes were equivalence of BRCA1/2 test uptake and costs of delivering TC versus UC. RESULTS: TC was noninferior to UC on all primary outcomes. At 2 weeks after pretest counseling, knowledge (d = 0.03; lower bound of 97.5% CI, -0.61), perceived stress (d = -0.12; upper bound of 97.5% CI, 0.21), and satisfaction (d = -0.16; lower bound of 97.5% CI, -0.70) had group differences and confidence intervals that did not cross their 1-point noninferiority limits. Decision conflict (d = 1.1; upper bound of 97.5% CI, 3.3) and cancer distress (d = -1.6; upper bound of 97.5% CI, 0.27) did not cross their 4-point noninferiority limit. Results were comparable at 3 months. TC was not equivalent to UC on BRCA1/2 test uptake (UC, 90.1%; TC, 84.2%). TC yielded cost savings of $114 per patient. CONCLUSION: Genetic counseling can be effectively and efficiently delivered via telephone to increase access and decrease costs.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over *Breast Neoplasms/genetics/prevention & control/psychology/therapy Conflict (Psychology) Cost-Benefit Analysis *Decision Making Female Genes, BRCA1 Genes, BRCA2 Genetic Counseling/*economics/*methods *Genetic Testing Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Humans Middle Aged *Mutation *Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/prevention & control/psychology/therapy Patient Satisfaction Quality of Life Stress, Psychological/etiology *Telephone"

METHODS: Participants in the USA, UK and Australia completed an anonymous web-based survey measuring awareness and knowledge of HPV (n=2409). We report analyses on a subsample of 1473 men and women in the USA (n=617), UK (n=404) and Australia (n=452) who had heard of HPV and completed questions about HPV testing. RESULTS: Overall, 50% of the sample (742/1473) had heard of HPV testing. Awareness of HPV testing was higher in the USA (62%) than in the UK (44%) and Australia (40%) (p<0.001). Among those who had heard of HPV testing, the mean knowledge score (out of 6) was 2.78 (SD: 1.49). No significant differences in knowledge score were found between the countries but, overall, women scored significantly higher than men (2.96 vs 2.52, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of HPV testing among people who have heard of HPV is higher in the USA than in the UK and Australia, but overall knowledge is low. This has important implications in those countries where HPV testing is being used in cervical screening. Increasing knowledge about the implications of HPV test results may help minimise any negative psychological consequences associated with HPV testing. Raising awareness in men could become increasingly important if HPV testing is introduced into the management of other cancers where HPV plays an aetiological role.","Adolescent Adult Aged Australia/epidemiology Female Great Britain/epidemiology *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Health Surveys Humans Male Middle Aged Papillomavirus Infections/*diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology Papillomavirus Vaccines Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology/*statistics & numerical data Prevalence Questionnaires Sexual Behavior/psychology United States/epidemiology Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology/*prevention & control/psychology"
24439052,The relevance of a geriatric assessment for elderly patients with a haematological malignancy--a systematic review.,Leuk Res,Hamaker ME and Prins MC and Stauder R,diakhuis,"BACKGROUND: Geriatric assessment is increasingly used to assess the health status of older cancer patients. We set out to assemble all available evidence on the relevance of a geriatric assessment in the treatment of older patients with haematological malignancies. METHODS: A systematic Medline and Embase search for studies in which a geriatric assessment was used to detect health issues or to address the association between baseline geriatric assessment and outcome. RESULTS: 18 publications from 15 studies were included. The median age of patients was 73 years (range 58-86). Despite generally good performance status, the prevalence of geriatric impairments was high. Geriatric impairments were associated with a shorter overall survival in a relevant proportion of studies (instrumental activities 55%, nutritional status 67%, cognitive capacities 83%, objectively measured physical capacity 100%). Comorbidity, physical capacity and nutritional status retained their significance even in multivariate analyses in 50%, 75%, and 67% of analyses respectively, whereas age and performance status lost their predictive value in most studies. One study found an association between comorbidity and chemotherapy-related non-haematological toxicity. In another study a pronounced association between summarised outcome of geriatric assessment and chemotherapy-related toxicity as well as response to treatment was described. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrates that a geriatric assessment can detect multiple health issues, even in patients with good performance status. Impairments in geriatric domains have predictive value for mortality and also appear to be associated with toxicity and other outcome measures and should thus be integrated in individualised treatment algorithms.","*Activities of Daily Living Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use *Cognition Databases, Bibliographic Female Geriatric Assessment/*statistics & numerical data Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/physiopathology Humans Male Middle Aged Nutritional Status Prognosis Survival Analysis"
24473795,Elevated serum pesticide levels and risk for Alzheimer disease.,JAMA Neurol,Richardson JR and Roy A and Shalat SL and von Stein RT and Hossain MM and Buckley B and Gearing M and Levey AI and German DC,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The causes of late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) are not yet understood but likely include a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Limited epidemiological studies suggest that occupational pesticide exposures are associated with AD. Previously, we reported that serum levels of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), the metabolite of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), were elevated in a small number of patients with AD (n=20). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between serum levels of DDE and AD and whether the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype modifies the association. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A case-control study consisting of existing samples from patients with AD and control participants from the Emory University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School's Alzheimer's Disease Center. Serum levels of DDE were measured in 79 control and 86 AD cases. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Serum DDE levels, AD diagnosis, severity of AD measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination score, and interaction with APOE4 status. RESULTS: Levels of DDE were 3.8-fold higher in the serum of those with AD (mean [SEM], 2.64 [0.35] ng/mg cholesterol) when compared with control participants (mean [SEM], 0.69 [0.1] ng/mg cholesterol; P < .001). The highest tertile of DDE levels was associated with an odds ratio of 4.18 for increased risk for AD (95% CI, 2.54-5.82; P < .001) and lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores (-1.605; range, -3.095 to -0.114; P < .0001). The Mini-Mental State Examination scores in the highest tertile of DDE were -1.753 points lower in the subpopulation carrying an APOE epsilon4 allele compared with those carrying an APOE epsilon3 allele (P interaction = .04). Serum levels of DDE were highly correlated with brain levels of DDE (rho = 0.95). Exposure of human neuroblastoma cells to DDT or DDE increased levels of amyloid precursor protein. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Elevated serum DDE levels are associated with an increased risk for AD and carriers of an APOE4 epsilon4 allele may be more susceptible to the effects of DDE. Both DDT and DDE increase amyloid precursor protein levels, providing mechanistic plausibility for the association of DDE exposure with AD. Identifying people who have elevated levels of DDE and carry an APOE epsilon4 allele may lead to early identification of some cases of AD.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Alleles Alzheimer Disease/blood/*chemically induced/genetics Amyloid beta-Peptides/drug effects Apolipoprotein E3/genetics Apolipoprotein E4/*genetics Apolipoproteins E Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies DDT/adverse effects Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/*adverse effects/blood Female Humans Insecticides/*adverse effects/blood Male Risk Severity of Illness Index Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects"

In STAP, strong external stimuli such as a transient low-pH stressor reprogrammed mammalian somatic cells, resulting in the generation of pluripotent cells. Through real-time imaging of STAP cells derived from purified lymphocytes, as well as gene rearrangement analysis, we found that committed somatic cells give rise to STAP cells by reprogramming rather than selection. STAP cells showed a substantial decrease in DNA methylation in the regulatory regions of pluripotency marker genes. Blastocyst injection showed that STAP cells efficiently contribute to chimaeric embryos and to offspring via germline transmission. We also demonstrate the derivation of robustly expandable pluripotent cell lines from STAP cells. Thus, our findings indicate that epigenetic fate determination of mammalian cells can be markedly converted in a context-dependent manner by strong environmental cues.","Acids/*pharmacology Animals Antigens, CD45/metabolism Cell Dedifferentiation/drug effects Cell Proliferation Chimera/metabolism DNA Methylation/drug effects Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism Female Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism Hydrogen-Ion Concentration Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism Male Mice Mice, Inbred ICR Nuclear Reprogramming/*drug effects Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism Organ Specificity"
24473592,Effects of child development accounts on early social-emotional development: an experimental test.,JAMA Pediatr,Huang J and Sherraden M and Kim Y and Clancy M,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: This study, based on Oklahoma's statewide Child Development Accounts (CDAs) program, presents findings from the first experimental test of the hypothesis that creating lifelong savings accounts for children at birth promotes their long-term well-being. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of CDAs, an innovative social policy to encourage lifelong saving and asset building for long-term development, on parent-reported social-emotional development in early childhood. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A statewide randomized experiment of CDAs was conducted in 2008, drawing a probability sample of 7328 children from all infants born in two 3-month periods in Oklahoma (April 1 through June 30 and August 1 through October 31, 2007). After agreeing to participate in the experiment, caregivers of 2704 infants completed a baseline survey and were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 1358) and control groups (n = 1346). Approximately 84% of participants completed a follow-up survey in the spring of 2011. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention offered CDAs, built on the existing Oklahoma 529 college-savings plan, to treatment participants. It also provided additional financial incentives and information. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome-child social-emotional development-is measured by scores from a 17-item version of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional. Caregivers completed it in the 3-year follow-up survey. Lower scores indicate better functioning. RESULTS: The CDAs have positive effects on social-emotional development for children at approximately age 4 years. The nonweighted treatment-control difference is -1.56 (90% CI, -2.87 to -0.22; P = .06), but the weighted difference is nonsignificant. The effects appear to be greater for disadvantaged subsamples, such as low-income households (weighted mean difference, -2.21; 90% CI, -4.01 to -0.42; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: As a complement to other early education and health interventions, CDAs may improve social-emotional development in early childhood. Their effects may be explained as a mediating process that influences parents. Child Development Accounts may influence parental attitudes, behaviors, expectations, and involvement; in turn, these may affect child development.","Adult Caregivers/*psychology *Child Development Child, Preschool Emotions Female Humans *Income Male Oklahoma Parents/*psychology Questionnaires Social Behavior Socioeconomic Factors"

Fasting serum glucose, insulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP; n = 1432), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (n = 843), and adiponectin (n = 1452) concentrations were measured. In multivariable analyses, higher anthocyanin and flavone intake were associated with significantly lower peripheral insulin resistance [homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; quintile 5 (Q5) to Q1 = -0.1, P-trend = 0.04 for anthocyanins and flavones] as a result of a decrease in insulin concentrations (Q5-Q1 = -0.7 muU/mL, P-trend = 0.02 anthocyanins; Q5-Q1 = -0.5 muU/mL, P-trend = 0.02 flavones). Higher anthocyanin intake was also associated with lower hs-CRP concentrations (Q5-Q1 = -0.3 mg/L, P-trend = 0.04), whereas those in the highest quintile of flavone intake had improved adiponectin concentrations (Q5-Q1 = 0.7 mug/L, P-trend = 0.01). Anthocyanin-rich foods were also associated with lower insulin and inflammation levels. No significant associations were observed for total or other flavonoid subclasses. Higher intakes of both anthocyanins and flavones were associated with improvements in insulin resistance and hs-CRP. These associations were found with intakes readily achieved in the diet. The observed reduction in insulin concentrations was similar to that reported previously for other lifestyle factors. Dose-response trials are needed to ascertain optimal intakes for the potential reduction of type 2 diabetes risk.","Adiponectin/blood Adult Anthocyanins/pharmacology/*therapeutic use Biological Markers/blood C-Reactive Protein/metabolism Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/prevention & control *Diet Female Flavones/pharmacology/*therapeutic use Humans Inflammation/blood/*prevention & control Insulin/blood *Insulin Resistance Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis *Phytotherapy Plant Extracts/pharmacology/*therapeutic use"
24477002,Antioxidants accelerate lung cancer progression in mice.,Sci Transl Med,Sayin VI and Ibrahim MX and Larsson E and Nilsson JA and Lindahl P and Bergo MO,Missing,"Antioxidants are widely used to protect cells from damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The concept that antioxidants can help fight cancer is deeply rooted in the general population, promoted by the food supplement industry, and supported by some scientific studies. However, clinical trials have reported inconsistent results. We show that supplementing the diet with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and vitamin E markedly increases tumor progression and reduces survival in mouse models of B-RAF- and K-RAS-induced lung cancer. RNA sequencing revealed that NAC and vitamin E, which are structurally unrelated, produce highly coordinated changes in tumor transcriptome profiles, dominated by reduced expression of endogenous antioxidant genes. NAC and vitamin E increase tumor cell proliferation by reducing ROS, DNA damage, and p53 expression in mouse and human lung tumor cells. Inactivation of p53 increases tumor growth to a similar degree as antioxidants and abolishes the antioxidant effect. Thus, antioxidants accelerate tumor growth by disrupting the ROS-p53 axis. Because somatic mutations in p53 occur late in tumor progression, antioxidants may accelerate the growth of early tumors or precancerous lesions in high-risk populations such as smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who receive NAC to relieve mucus production.",Missing

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled 3-month trial was conducted with two post-treatment assessments of 200 breast cancer survivors assigned to either 12 weeks of 90-minute twice per week hatha yoga classes or a wait-list control. The main outcome measures were lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and scores on the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), the vitality scale from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. RESULTS: Immediately post-treatment, fatigue was not lower (P > .05) but vitality was higher (P = .01) in the yoga group compared with the control group. At 3 months post-treatment, fatigue was lower in the yoga group (P = .002), vitality was higher (P = .01), and IL-6 (P = .027), TNF-alpha (P = .027), and IL-1beta (P = .037) were lower for yoga participants compared with the control group. Groups did not differ on depression at either time (P > .2). Planned secondary analyses showed that the frequency of yoga practice had stronger associations with fatigue at both post-treatment visits (P = .019; P < .001), as well as vitality (P = .016; P = .0045), but not depression (P > .05) than simple group assignment; more frequent practice produced larger changes. At 3 months post-treatment, increasing yoga practice also led to a decrease in IL-6 (P = .01) and IL-1beta (P = .03) production but not in TNF-alpha production (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Chronic inflammation may fuel declines in physical function leading to frailty and disability. If yoga dampens or limits both fatigue and inflammation, then regular practice could have substantial health benefits.",Adult Aged Breast Neoplasms/blood/*complications Depression/etiology/*therapy Fatigue/etiology/*therapy Female Humans Inflammation/blood/etiology/*therapy Interleukin-1/blood Interleukin-1beta/blood Middle Aged Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood *Yoga/psychology

Moreover, HPV testing can be done on a vaginal sample self-taken by a woman, which offers an opportunity to improve screening coverage. However, the clinical accuracy of HPV testing on self-samples is not well-known. We assessed whether HPV testing on self-collected samples is equivalent to HPV testing on samples collected by clinicians. METHODS: We identified relevant studies through a search of PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they fulfilled all of the following selection criteria: a cervical cell sample was self-collected by a woman followed by a sample taken by a clinician; a high-risk HPV test was done on the self-sample (index test) and HPV-testing or cytological interpretation was done on the specimen collected by the clinician (comparator tests); and the presence or absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) or worse was verified by colposcopy and biopsy in all enrolled women or in women with one or more positive tests. The absolute accuracy for finding CIN2 or worse, or CIN grade 3 (CIN3) or worse of the index and comparator tests as well as the relative accuracy of the index versus the comparator tests were pooled using bivariate normal models and random effect models. FINDINGS: We included data from 36 studies, which altogether enrolled 154 556 women. The absolute accuracy varied by clinical setting. In the context of screening, HPV testing on self-samples detected, on average, 76% (95% CI 69-82) of CIN2 or worse and 84% (72-92) of CIN3 or worse. The pooled absolute specificity to exclude CIN2 or worse was 86% (83-89) and 87% (84-90) to exclude CIN3 or worse. The variation of the relative accuracy of HPV testing on self-samples compared with tests on clinician-taken samples was low across settings, enabling pooling of the relative accuracy over all studies. The pooled sensitivity of HPV testing on self-samples was lower than HPV testing on a clinician-taken sample (ratio 0.88 [95% CI 0.85-0.91] for CIN2 or worse and 0.89 [0.83-0.96] for CIN3 or worse). Also specificity was lower in self-samples versus clinician-taken samples (ratio 0.96 [0.95-0.97] for CIN2 or worse and 0.96 [0.93-0.99] for CIN3 or worse). HPV testing with signal-based assays on self-samples was less sensitive and specific than testing on clinician-based samples. By contrast, some PCR-based HPV tests generally showed similar sensitivity on both self-samples and clinician-based samples. INTERPRETATION: In screening programmes using signal-based assays, sampling by a clinician should be recommended. However, HPV testing on a self-sample can be suggested as an additional strategy to reach women not participating in the regular screening programme. Some PCR-based HPV tests could be considered for routine screening after careful piloting assessing feasibility, logistics, population compliance, and costs.

Retrospective enquiries to the families of about 50,000 deceased Russians had found excess vodka use among those dying from external causes (accident, suicide, violence) and eight particular disease groupings. We now seek prospective evidence of these associations. METHODS: In three Russian cities (Barnaul, Byisk, and Tomsk), we interviewed 200,000 adults during 1999-2008 (with 12,000 re-interviewed some years later) and followed them until 2010 for cause-specific mortality. In 151,000 with no previous disease and some follow-up at ages 35-74 years, Poisson regression (adjusted for age at risk, amount smoked, education, and city) was used to calculate the relative risks associating vodka consumption with mortality. We have combined these relative risks with age-specific death rates to get 20-year absolute risks. FINDINGS: Among 57,361 male smokers with no previous disease, the estimated 20-year risks of death at ages 35-54 years were 16% (95% CI 15-17) for those who reported consuming less than a bottle of vodka per week at baseline, 20% (18-22) for those consuming 1-2.9 bottles per week, and 35% (31-39) for those consuming three or more bottles per week; trend p<0.0001. The corresponding risks of death at ages 55-74 years were 50% (48-52) for those who reported consuming less than a bottle of vodka per week at baseline, 54% (51-57) for those consuming 1-2.9 bottles per week, and 64% (59-69) for those consuming three or more bottles per week; trend p<0.0001. In both age ranges most of the excess mortality in heavier drinkers was from external causes or the eight disease groupings strongly associated with alcohol in the retrospective enquiries. Self-reported drinking fluctuated; of the men who reported drinking three or more bottles of vodka per week who were reinterviewed a few years later, about half (185 of 321) then reported drinking less than one bottle per week. Such fluctuations must have substantially attenuated the apparent hazards of heavy drinking in this study, yet self-reported vodka use at baseline still strongly predicted risk. Among male non-smokers and among females, self-reported heavy drinking was uncommon, but seemed to involve similar absolute excess risks. INTERPRETATION: This large prospective study strongly reinforces other evidence that vodka is a major cause of the high risk of premature death in Russian adults.

24477278,International prevalence of indoor tanning: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,JAMA Dermatol,Wehner MR and Chren MM and Nameth D and Choudhry A and Gaskins M and Nead KT and Boscardin WJ and Linos E,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Indoor tanning is a known carcinogen, but the scope of exposure to this hazard is not known. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the international prevalence of exposure to indoor tanning. DATA SOURCES: Studies were identified through systematic searches of PubMed (1966 to present), Scopus (1823 to present), and Web of Science (1898 to present) databases, last performed on March 16, 2013. We also hand searched reference lists to identify records missed by database searches and publicly available data not yet published in the scientific literature. STUDY SELECTION: Records reporting a prevalence of indoor tanning were eligible for inclusion. We excluded case-control studies, reports with insufficient study information, and reports of groups recruited using factors related to indoor tanning. Two independent investigators performed searches and study selection. Our search yielded 1976 unique records. After exclusions, 161 records were assessed for eligibility in full text, and 88 were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent investigators extracted data on characteristics of study participants, inclusion/exclusion criteria, data collection format, outcomes, and statistical methods. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to summarize the prevalence of indoor tanning in different age categories. We calculated the population proportional attributable risk of indoor tanning in the United States, Europe, and Australia for nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and melanoma. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Ever and past-year exposure to indoor tanning. RESULTS: The summary prevalence of ever exposure was 35.7% (95% CI, 27.5%-44.0%) for adults, 55.0% (33.0%-77.1%) for university students, and 19.3% (14.7%-24.0%) for adolescents. The summary prevalence of past-year exposure was 14.0% (95% CI, 11.5%-16.5%) for adults, 43.1% (21.7%-64.5%) for university students, and 18.3% (12.6%-24.0%) for adolescents. These results included data from 406 696 participants. The population proportional attributable risk were 3.0% to 21.8% for NMSC and 2.6% to 9.4% for melanoma, corresponding to more than 450 000 NMSC cases and more than 10 000 melanoma cases each year attributable to indoor tanning in the United States, Europe, and Australia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Exposure to indoor tanning is common in Western countries, especially among young persons. Given the large number of skin cancer cases attributable to indoor tanning, these findings highlight a major public health issue.","Australia/epidemiology Beauty Culture Canada/epidemiology Carcinoma, Basal Cell/epidemiology/etiology Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/epidemiology/etiology Cosmetic Techniques/*utilization Europe/epidemiology Humans Melanoma/epidemiology/etiology Risk Assessment Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology Sunbathing/*statistics & numerical data Suntan Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects United States/epidemiology"

We examined to what extent self-measurement of home blood pressure (HBP) refines risk stratification across increasing categories of conventional blood pressure (CBP). METHODS AND FINDINGS: This meta-analysis included 5,008 individuals randomly recruited from five populations (56.6% women; mean age, 57.1 y). All were not treated with antihypertensive drugs. In multivariable analyses, hazard ratios (HRs) associated with 10-mm Hg increases in systolic HBP were computed across CBP categories, using the following systolic/diastolic CBP thresholds (in mm Hg): optimal, <120/<80; normal, 120-129/80-84; high-normal, 130-139/85-89; mild hypertension, 140-159/90-99; and severe hypertension, >/=160/>/=100. Over 8.3 y, 522 participants died, and 414, 225, and 194 had cardiovascular, cardiac, and cerebrovascular events, respectively. In participants with optimal or normal CBP, HRs for a composite cardiovascular end point associated with a 10-mm Hg higher systolic HBP were 1.28 (1.01-1.62) and 1.22 (1.00-1.49), respectively. At high-normal CBP and in mild hypertension, the HRs were 1.24 (1.03-1.49) and 1.20 (1.06-1.37), respectively, for all cardiovascular events and 1.33 (1.07-1.65) and 1.30 (1.09-1.56), respectively, for stroke. In severe hypertension, the HRs were not significant (p>/=0.20). Among people with optimal, normal, and high-normal CBP, 67 (5.0%), 187 (18.4%), and 315 (30.3%), respectively, had masked hypertension (HBP>/=130 mm Hg systolic or >/=85 mm Hg diastolic). Compared to true optimal CBP, masked hypertension was associated with a 2.3-fold (1.5-3.5) higher cardiovascular risk. A limitation was few data from low- and middle-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: HBP substantially refines risk stratification at CBP levels assumed to carry no or only mildly increased risk, in particular in the presence of masked hypertension. Randomized trials could help determine the best use of CBP vs. HBP in guiding BP management. Our study identified a novel indication for HBP, which, in view of its low cost and the increased availability of electronic communication, might be globally applicable, even in remote areas or in low-resource settings.","Adult Aged *Blood Pressure Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory/*statistics & numerical data Cardiovascular Diseases/diagnosis/*epidemiology Europe/epidemiology Female Humans Japan/epidemiology Male Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Prospective Studies Risk Assessment/methods Self Report Uruguay/epidemiology Young Adult"
24488738,"Dietary sodium, adiposity, and inflammation in healthy adolescents.",Pediatrics,Zhu H and Pollock NK and Kotak I and Gutin B and Wang X and Bhagatwala J and Parikh S and Harshfield GA and Dong Y,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationships of sodium intake with adiposity and inflammation in healthy adolescents. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involved 766 healthy white and African American adolescents aged 14 to 18 years. Dietary sodium intake was estimated by 7-day 24-hour dietary recall. Percent body fat was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue and visceral adipose tissue were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. Fasting blood samples were measured for leptin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. RESULTS: The average sodium intake was 3280 mg/day. Ninety-seven percent of our adolescents exceeded the American Heart Association recommendation for sodium intake. Multiple linear regressions revealed that dietary sodium intake was independently associated with body weight (beta = 0.23), BMI (beta = 0.23), waist circumference (beta = 0.23), percent body fat (beta = 0.17), fat mass (beta = 0.23), subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (beta = 0.25), leptin (beta = 0.20), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (beta = 0.61; all Ps < .05). No relation was found between dietary sodium intake and visceral adipose tissue, skinfold thickness, adiponectin, C-reactive protein, or intercellular adhesion molecule-1. All the significant associations persisted after correction for multiple testing (all false discovery rates < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The mean sodium consumption of our adolescents is as high as that of adults and more than twice the daily intake recommended by the American Heart Association. High sodium intake is positively associated with adiposity and inflammation independent of total energy intake and sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption.","Adipose Tissue/physiology Adiposity/*physiology Adolescent African Americans/*ethnology *Body Mass Index Cohort Studies Cross-Sectional Studies European Continental Ancestry Group/*ethnology Female *Health Status Humans Inflammation/diagnosis/ethnology/metabolism Male Obesity/diagnosis/ethnology/metabolism Sodium, Dietary/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/metabolism United States/ethnology"
24488736,Parental underestimates of child weight: a meta-analysis.,Pediatrics,Lundahl A and Kidwell KM and Nelson TD,Missing,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Parental perceptions of their children's weight play an important role in obesity prevention and treatment. The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of parents worldwide who underestimate their children's weight and moderators of such misperceptions. METHODS: Original studies published to January 2013 were chosen through literature searches in PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, and CINAHL databases. References of retrieved articles were also searched for relevant studies. Studies were published in English and assessed parental perceptions of children's weight and then compared perceptions to recognized standards for defining overweight based on anthropometric measures. Data were extracted on study-level constructs, child- and parent-characteristics, procedural characteristics, and parental underestimates separately for normal-weight and overweight/obese samples. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models and adjusted for publication bias. Moderators were explored using mixed-effect models. RESULTS: A total of 69 articles (representing 78 samples; n = 15,791) were included in the overweight/obese meta-analysis. Adjusted effect sizes revealed that 50.7% (95% confidence interval 31.1%-70.2%) of parents underestimate their overweight/obese children's weight. Significant moderators of this effect included child's age and BMI. A total of 52 articles (representing 59 samples; n = 64,895) were included in the normal-weight meta-analysis. Pooled effect sizes indicated that 14.3% (95% confidence interval 11.7%-17.4%) of parents underestimate their children's normal-weight status. Significant moderators of this effect included child gender, parent weight, and the method (visual versus nonvisual) in which perception was assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Half of parents underestimated their children's overweight/obese status and a significant minority underestimated children's normal weight. Pediatricians are well positioned to make efforts to remedy parental underestimates and promote adoption of healthy habits.","Body Weight/*physiology Child *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Humans Overweight/*diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology *Parent-Child Relations *Perception"

We report the first human infection with a novel reassortant avian influenza A H10N8 virus. METHODS: We obtained and analysed clinical, epidemiological, and virological data from a patient from Nanchang City, China. Tracheal aspirate specimens were tested for influenza virus and other possible pathogens by RT-PCR, viral culture, and sequence analyses. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed. FINDINGS: A woman aged 73 years presented with fever and was admitted to hospital on Nov 30, 2013. She developed multiple organ failure and died 9 days after illness onset. A novel reassortant avian influenza A H10N8 virus was isolated from the tracheal aspirate specimen obtained from the patient 7 days after onset of illness. Sequence analyses revealed that all the genes of the virus were of avian origin, with six internal genes from avian influenza A H9N2 viruses. The aminoacid motif GlnSerGly at residues 226-228 of the haemagglutinin protein indicated avian-like receptor binding preference. A mixture of glutamic acid and lysine at residue 627 in PB2 protein--which is associated with mammalian adaptation--was detected in the original tracheal aspirate samples. The virus was sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors. Sputum and blood cultures and deep sequencing analysis indicated no co-infection with bacteria or fungi. Epidemiological investigation established that the patient had visited a live poultry market 4 days before illness onset.

Total dietary fiber is associated with WG and its health benefits. The purpose was to determine whether associations exist between WG intake (no-WG intake, 0 ounce equivalent [oz eq]; low, >0-<3 oz eq; high, >/=3 oz eq) and total dietary fiber intake among Americans 2 years and older. One-day food intake data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009 to 2010 (n = 9042) showed that only 2.9% and 7.7% of children/adolescents (2-18 years) and adults (>/=19 years) consumed at least 3 WG oz eq/d, respectively. For children/adolescents and adults, individuals in the high WG intake group were 59 and 76 times more likely to fall in the third fiber tertile, respectively, compared with those with no-WG intake. Total dietary fiber intake from food sources varied by WG intake group for children/adolescents and adults with more total dietary fiber consumed from ready-to-eat (RTE) and hot cereals and yeast breads/rolls in the high WG intake group compared with the no-WG intake group. Major WG sources for children/adolescents and adults included yeast bread/rolls (24% and 27%, respectively), RTE cereals (25% and 20%, respectively), and oatmeal (12% and 21%, respectively). Among those with the highest WG intake, WG RTE cereal with no added bran was the greatest contributor to total dietary fiber compared with other RTE cereal types. Whole grain foods make a substantial contribution to total dietary fiber intake and should be promoted to meet recommendations.",Missing

To achieve a close to natural replacement for the lost hand, the user should be provided with the rich sensations that we naturally perceive when grasping or manipulating an object. Ideal bidirectional hand prostheses should involve both a reliable decoding of the user's intentions and the delivery of nearly ""natural"" sensory feedback through remnant afferent pathways, simultaneously and in real time. However, current hand prostheses fail to achieve these requirements, particularly because they lack any sensory feedback. We show that by stimulating the median and ulnar nerve fascicles using transversal multichannel intrafascicular electrodes, according to the information provided by the artificial sensors from a hand prosthesis, physiologically appropriate (near-natural) sensory information can be provided to an amputee during the real-time decoding of different grasping tasks to control a dexterous hand prosthesis. This feedback enabled the participant to effectively modulate the grasping force of the prosthesis with no visual or auditory feedback. Three different force levels were distinguished and consistently used by the subject. The results also demonstrate that a high complexity of perception can be obtained, allowing the subject to identify the stiffness and shape of three different objects by exploiting different characteristics of the elicited sensations. This approach could improve the efficacy and ""life-like"" quality of hand prostheses, resulting in a keystone strategy for the near-natural replacement of missing hands.",Missing

Results showed that individual voter differences in energy level can grossly alter group loudness and bias the vote. Unless some control is imposed on the sound level of individual voters, it is difficult to establish even a two-thirds majority, much less a simple majority. There is no symmetry in the bias created by unequal sound production of individuals. Soft voices do not bias the group loudness much, but loud voices do.

METHODS: We used a quasiexperimental pre-test post-test design to evaluate actionable stroke knowledge of 210 children aged 9 to 10 years in response to a single, 15-minute exposure to a stroke education video game conducted in the school computer laboratory. After immediate post-test, we provided remote password-protected online video game access and encouraged children to play at their leisure from home. An unannounced delayed post-test occurred 7 weeks later. RESULTS: Two hundred ten children completed pretest, 205 completed immediate post-test, whereas 198 completed delayed post-test. One hundred fifty-six (74%) children had Internet access at home, and 41 (26%), mostly girls, played the video game remotely. There was significant improvement in stroke symptom composite scores, calling 911, and all individual stroke knowledge items, including a distractor across the testing sequence (P<0.05). Children who played the video game remotely demonstrated significant improvement in knowledge of 1 symptom (sudden imbalance) compared with children who did not (P<0.05), although overall composite scores showed no difference. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke education video games may represent novel means for improving and sustaining actionable stroke knowledge of children.","Brain Ischemia Child Female Health Education/*methods *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Humans Intracranial Hemorrhages Male New York City Poverty *Stroke *Video Games"
24503673,Guidelines for the prevention of stroke in women: a statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.,Stroke,Bushnell C and McCullough LD and Awad IA and Chireau MV and Fedder WN and Furie KL and Howard VJ and Lichtman JH and Lisabeth LD and Pina IL and Reeves MJ and Rexrode KM and Saposnik G and Singh V and Towfighi A and Vaccarino V and Walters MR,Missing,"PURPOSE: The aim of this statement is to summarize data on stroke risk factors that are unique to and more common in women than men and to expand on the data provided in prior stroke guidelines and cardiovascular prevention guidelines for women. This guideline focuses on the risk factors unique to women, such as reproductive factors, and those that are more common in women, including migraine with aura, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and atrial fibrillation. METHODS: Writing group members were nominated by the committee chair on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas and were approved by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council's Scientific Statement Oversight Committee and the AHA's Manuscript Oversight Committee. The panel reviewed relevant articles on adults using computerized searches of the medical literature through May 15, 2013. The evidence is organized within the context of the AHA framework and is classified according to the joint AHA/American College of Cardiology and supplementary AHA Stroke Council methods of classifying the level of certainty and the class and level of evidence. The document underwent extensive AHA internal peer review, Stroke Council Leadership review, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee review before consideration and approval by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee. RESULTS: We provide current evidence, research gaps, and recommendations on risk of stroke related to preeclampsia, oral contraceptives, menopause, and hormone replacement, as well as those risk factors more common in women, such as obesity/metabolic syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and migraine with aura. CONCLUSIONS: To more accurately reflect the risk of stroke in women across the lifespan, as well as the clear gaps in current risk scores, we believe a female-specific stroke risk score is warranted.","American Heart Association Female Guidelines as Topic/*standards Humans Societies, Medical/*standards Stroke/epidemiology/*prevention & control United States Women's Health/*standards"
24415713,Lower levels of sodium intake and reduced cardiovascular risk.,Circulation,Cook NR and Appel LJ and Whelton PK,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have raised the possibility of adverse effects of low sodium, particularly <2300 mg/d, on cardiovascular disease; however, these paradoxical findings might have resulted from suboptimal measurement of sodium and potential biases related to indication or reverse causation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Phases 1 and 2 of the Trials of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP) collected multiple 24-hour urine specimens among prehypertensive individuals. During extended post-trial surveillance, 193 cardiovascular events or cardiovascular disease deaths occurred among 2275 participants not in a sodium reduction intervention with 10 (TOHP II) or 15 (TOHP I) years of post-trial follow-up. Median sodium excretion was 3630 mg/d, with 1.4% of the participants having intake <1500 mg/d and 10% <2300 mg/d, consistent with national levels. Compared with those with sodium excretion of 3600 to <4800 mg/d, risk for those with sodium <2300 mg/d was 32% lower after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-1.37; P for trend=0.13). There was a linear 17% increase in risk per 1000 mg/d increase in sodium (P=0.05). Spline curves supported a linear association of sodium with cardiovascular events, which continued to decrease from 3600 to 2300 and 1500 mg/d, although the data were sparse at the lowest levels. Controlling for creatinine levels had little effect on these results. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the TOHP studies, which overcome the major methodological challenges of prior studies, are consistent with overall health benefits of reducing sodium intake to the 1500 to 2300 mg/d range in the majority of the population, in agreement with current dietary guidelines.","Adult Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology/*prevention & control Creatinine/urine Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Linear Models Male Middle Aged Risk Factors Sodium/urine Sodium, Dietary/*adverse effects"

Since psychiatric intervention might improve asthma control, we examined whether patients with severe, prednisone-dependent asthma are at higher risk of these disorders than patients with severe non-prednisone dependent asthma or mild-moderate asthma, and whether they exhibit different personality traits. METHODS: Sixty-seven adults with severe prednisone-dependent asthma, 47 with severe non-prednisone dependent and 73 patients with mild-moderate asthma completed the HADS depression and anxiety subscale and the NEO-FFI for personality traits. In addition, asthma duration, body mass index and FEV1 were measured. RESULTS: The prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms (9% vs. 0 vs. 0%; p = 0.009) and anxiety symptoms (19% vs. 6.4 vs. 5.5%; p = 0.01), was higher in patients with severe, prednisone-dependent asthma than in patients with severe non-prednisone dependent or mild-moderate asthma. Patients with prednisone-dependent asthma were respectively 3.4 (95%CI: 1.0-10.8 p = 0.04) and 3.5 (95%CI: 1.3-9.6 p = 0.01) times more likely to have significant depression symptoms and 1.6 (95%CI: 0.7-3.7, p = 0.2) and 2.5 (95%CI: 01.1-5.5, p = 0.02) times more likely to have symptoms of anxiety than patients with severe non-prednisone dependent or mild-moderate asthma.

We assessed the effect of a weight loss and healthy living programme on weight loss in football (soccer) fans. METHODS: We did a two-group, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial of 747 male football fans aged 35-65 years with a body-mass index (BMI) of 28 kg/m(2) or higher from 13 Scottish professional football clubs. Participants were randomly assigned with SAS (version 9.2, block size 2-9) in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by club, to a weight loss programme delivered by community coaching staff in 12 sessions held every week. The intervention group started a weight loss programme within 3 weeks, and the comparison group were put on a 12 month waiting list. All participants received a weight management booklet. Primary outcome was mean difference in weight loss between groups at 12 months, expressed as absolute weight and a percentage of their baseline weight. Primary outcome assessment was masked. Analyses were based on intention to treat. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN32677491. FINDINGS: 374 men were allocated to the intervention group and 374 to the comparison group. 333 (89%) of the intervention group and 355 (95%) of the comparison group completed 12 month assessments. At 12 months the mean difference in weight loss between groups, adjusted for baseline weight and club, was 4.94 kg (95% CI 3.95-5.94) and percentage weight loss, similarly adjusted, was 4.36% (3.64-5.08), both in favour of the intervention (p<0.0001). Eight serious adverse events were reported, five in the intervention group (lost consciousness due to drugs for pre-existing angina, gallbladder removal, hospital admission with suspected heart attack, ruptured gut, and ruptured Achilles tendon) and three in the comparison group (transient ischaemic attack, and two deaths). Of these, two adverse events were reported as related to participation in the programme (gallbladder removal and ruptured Achilles tendon). INTERPRETATION: The FFIT programme can help a large proportion of men to lose a clinically important amount of weight; it offers one effective strategy to challenge male obesity. FUNDING: Scottish Government and The UK Football Pools funded delivery of the programme through a grant to the Scottish Premier League Trust. The National Institute for Health Research Public Health Research Programme funded the assessment (09/3010/06).",Adult Aged Body Mass Index Cost-Benefit Analysis Exercise Therapy/economics/methods Health Promotion/*methods Healthy People Programs/economics/*methods Humans Male Middle Aged Obesity/prevention & control Overweight/*prevention & control Risk Reduction Behavior Scotland *Soccer Treatment Outcome Weight Loss/*physiology

24504358,Weight rhythms: weight increases during weekends and decreases during weekdays.,Obes Facts,Orsama AL and Mattila E and Ermes M and van Gils M and Wansink B and Korhonen I,Missing,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The week's cycle influences sleep, exercise, and eating habits. An accurate description of weekly weight rhythms has not been reported yet - especially across people who lose weight versus those who maintain or gain weight. METHODS: The daily weight in 80 adults (BMI 20.0-33.5 kg/m(2); age, 25-62 years) was recorded and analysed to determine if a group-level weekly weight fluctuation exists. This was a retrospective study of 4,657 measurements during 15-330 monitoring days. Semi-parametric regression was used to model the rhythm. RESULTS: A pattern of daily weight changes was found (p < 0.05), with higher weight early in the week (Sunday and Monday) and decreasing weight during the week. Increases begin on Saturday and decreases begin on Tuesday. This compensation pattern was strongest for those who lost or maintained weight and weakest for those who slowly gained weight. CONCLUSION: Weight variations between weekends and weekdays should be considered as normal instead of signs of weight gain. Those who compensate the most are most likely to either lose or maintain weight over time. Long-term habits may make more of a difference than short-term splurges. People prone to weight gain could be counselled about the importance of weekday compensation.",Missing

Novel school-based approaches are needed to modify healthy living behaviors and attenuate weight gain in children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a peer-led healthy living program called Healthy Buddies on weight gain and its determinants when disseminated at the provincial level to elementary school students. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster-randomized effectiveness trial performed during the 2009-2010 school year. Baseline and follow-up measurements were made in October 2009 and May 2010, respectively. The study was performed in 19 elementary schools in Manitoba, Canada, and included 647 elementary school students aged 6 to 12 years (48% girls). INTERVENTION: Schools were randomized to receive regular curriculum or Healthy Buddies lesson plans. Lesson plans were delivered by older (9- to 12-year-old) elementary school students to the younger (6- to 8-year-old) peers and targeted 3 components of health: physical activity, healthy eating, and self-esteem and body image. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were the change in waist circumference and body mass index z score. Secondary outcomes included physical activity (steps per day), cardiorespiratory fitness, self-efficacy, healthy living knowledge, and self-reported dietary intake. RESULTS: At baseline, 36% of children were overweight or obese and 11% achieved the recommended 13,500 steps per day. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that waist circumference declined significantly in the intervention group relative to controls: -1.42 cm (-2.68 to -0.17; P = .03). Reductions in waist circumference were particularly significant for children who were younger, overweight or obese, or attending First Nations schools. No difference in body mass index z score was observed between groups. Self-efficacy, healthy living knowledge, and dietary intake significantly improved in younger peers who received the intervention compared with students from control schools. No differences were observed in daily step counts or cardiorespiratory fitness between the groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The implementation of Healthy Buddies lesson plans delivered by older peers within an elementary school setting is an effective method for attenuating increases in central adiposity and improving knowledge of healthy living behaviors among elementary school students. Improvements were achieved with parallel improvements in diet quality, self-efficacy, and knowledge of healthy living.

We conducted a large-scale association study in 1583 adolescents to identify genes affecting cortical thickness. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; n=54 837) within genes whose expression changed between stages of growth and differentiation of a human neural stem cell line were selected for association analyses with average cortical thickness. We identified a variant, rs7171755, associating with thinner cortex in the left hemisphere (P=1.12 x 10-7), particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes. Localized effects of this SNP on cortical thickness differently affected verbal and nonverbal intellectual abilities. The rs7171755 polymorphism acted in cis to affect expression in the human brain of the synaptic cell adhesion glycoprotein-encoding gene NPTN. We also found that cortical thickness and NPTN expression were on average higher in the right hemisphere, suggesting that asymmetric NPTN expression may render the left hemisphere more sensitive to the effects of NPTN mutations, accounting for the lateralized effect of rs7171755 found in our study. Altogether, our findings support a potential role for regional synaptic dysfunctions in forms of intellectual deficits.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 11 February 2014; doi:10.1038/mp.2013.197.",Missing
25217165,CD8+ T Cells Prevent Antigen-Induced Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Dengue Disease in Mice.,J Immunol,Zellweger RM and Eddy WE and Tang WW and Miller R and Shresta S,lji,"Dengue virus (DENV) causes pathologies ranging from the febrile illness dengue fever to the potentially lethal severe dengue disease. A major risk factor for developing severe dengue disease is the presence of subprotective DENV-reactive Abs from a previous infection (or from an immune mother), which can induce Ab-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE). However, infection in the presence of subprotective anti-DENV Abs does not always result in severe disease, suggesting that other factors influence disease severity. In this study we investigated how CD8+ T cell responses influence the outcome of Ab-mediated severe dengue disease. Mice were primed with aluminum hydroxide-adjuvanted UV-inactivated DENV prior to challenge with DENV. Priming failed to induce robust CD8+ T cell responses, and it induced nonneutralizing Ab responses that increased disease severity upon infection. Transfer of exogenous DENV-activated CD8+ T cells into primed mice prior to infection prevented Ab-dependent enhancement and dramatically reduced viral load. Our results suggest that in the presence of subprotective anti-DENV Abs, efficient CD8+ T cell responses reduce the risk of Ab-mediated severe dengue disease.",Missing

The design was a cohort study with a 2-year follow-up and 3-monthly measurements and prospectively collected data on weather variables. The study population consisted of 222 primary care patients with hip OA. Weather variables included temperature, wind speed, total amount of sun hours, precipitation, barometric pressure, and relative humidity. The primary outcomes were severity of hip pain and hip disability as measured with the Western Ontario and McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain and function subscales. Associations between hip pain and hip disability and the weather variables were assessed using crude and multivariate adjusted linear mixed-model analysis for repeated measurements. On the day of questionnaire completion, mean relative humidity was associated with WOMAC pain (estimate 0.1; 95% confidence interval=0.0-0.2; P=.02). Relative humidity contributed < or = 1% to the explained within-patient variance and between-patient variance of the WOMAC pain score. Mean barometric pressure was associated with WOMAC function (estimate 0.1; 95% confidence interval=0.0-0.1; P=.02). Barometric pressure contributed < or = 1% to the explained within-patient variance and between-patient variance of the WOMAC function score. The other weather variables were not associated with the WOMAC pain or function score. Our results support the general opinion of OA patients that barometric pressure and relative humidity influence perceived OA symptoms. However, the contribution of these weather variables (< or = 1%) to the severity of OA symptoms is not considered to be clinically relevant.",Missing

It was hypothesized that preterm infants exposed to higher word counts would have higher cognitive and language scores at 7 and 18 months' corrected age. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 36 preterm infants with a birth weight </=1250 g. Sixteen-hour recordings were made in the NICU by using a digital language processor at 32 and 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Regression analyses were performed on adult word count per hour, with Bayley-III measures correcting for birth weight. RESULTS: Adult word counts in the NICU were positively correlated with 7- and 18-month Bayley-III scores. For the 32-week recording, in regression analyses adjusting for birth weight, adult word count per hour independently accounted for 12% of the variance in language composite scores (P = .04) and 20% of the variance in expressive communication scores at 18 months (P = .008). For the 36-week recording, adult word count per hour independently accounted for 26% of the variance in cognitive composite scores at 7 months (P = .0049). CONCLUSIONS: Increased amount of parent talk with preterm infants in the NICU was associated with higher 7- and 18-month corrected age Bayley-III language and cognitive scores.

This study aimed to objectively assess the level of physical activity in daily life in adult smokers without airflow obstruction in comparison with matched non-smokers, and to investigate the determinants for daily physical activity in smokers. METHODS: Sixty smokers (aged 50 (39-54) years) and 50 non-smokers (aged 48 (40-53) years) matched for gender, age, anthropometric characteristics, educational level, employment status and seasons of the year assessment period were cross-sectionally assessed regarding their daily physical activity with a step counter, besides assessment of lung function, functional exercise capacity, quality of life, anxiety, depression, self-reported comorbidities carbon monoxide level, nicotine dependence and smoking habits. RESULTS: When compared with non-smokers, smokers walked less in daily life (7923 +/- 3558 vs 9553 +/- 3637 steps/day, respectively), presented worse lung function, functional exercise capacity, quality of life, anxiety and depression. Multiple regression analyses identified functional exercise capacity, Borg fatigue, self-reported motivation/physical activity behaviour and cardiac disease as significant determinants of number of steps/day in smokers (partial r(2) = 0.10, 0.12, 0.16 and 0.05; b = 15, -997, 1207 and -2330 steps/day, respectively; overall fit of the model R(2) = 0.38; P < 0.001).

24522374,The reliability of teledermatology to triage inpatient dermatology consultations.,JAMA Dermatol,Barbieri JS and Nelson CA and James WD and Margolis DJ and Littman-Quinn R and Kovarik CL and Rosenbach M,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Many hospitals do not have inpatient dermatologic consultative services, and most have reduced availability of services during off-hours. Dermatologists based in outpatient settings can find it challenging to determine the urgency with which they need to evaluate inpatients when consultations are requested. Teledermatology may provide a valuable mechanism for dermatologists to triage inpatient consultations and increase efficiency, thereby expanding access to specialized care for hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a store-and-forward teledermatology system is reliable for the initial triage of inpatient dermatology consultations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study of 50 consenting adult patients, hospitalized for any indication, for whom an inpatient dermatology consultation was requested between September 1, 2012, and April 31, 2013, at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, an academic medical center. The participants were evaluated separately by both an in-person dermatologist and 2 independent teledermatologists. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary study outcomes were the initial triage and decision to biopsy concordance between in-person and teledermatology evaluations. RESULTS: Triage decisions were as follows: if the in-person dermatologist recommended the patient be seen the same day, the teledermatologist agreed in 90% of the consultations. If the in-person dermatologist recommended a biopsy, the teledermatologist agreed in 95% of cases on average. When the teledermatologist did not choose the same course of action, there was substantial diagnostic agreement between the teledermatologist and the in-person dermatologist. The Kendall tau rank correlation coefficients for initial triage concordance between the in-person dermatologist and teledermatologists were 0.41 and 0.48. The Cohen kappa coefficients for decision to biopsy concordance were 0.35 and 0.61. The teledermatologists were able to triage 60% of consultations to be seen the next day or later. The teledermatologists were able to triage, on average, 10% of patients to be seen as outpatients after discharge.

Furthermore, it is unclear whether EC-related knowledge and behaviour varies between young men and women. This study investigated knowledge, attitudes and experiences with EC among low SES young men and women aged 18-25 years. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-eight new enrollees at two Los Angeles primary medical care clinics completed surveys about their knowledge, past use and likelihood of using EC. Chi square (chi2) and regression analyses assessed gender differences in knowledge and attitudes. RESULTS: Women were more likely than men to accurately answer questions about EC and its use. Across both sexes, accurate knowledge predicted future willingness to use EC. Only half the women and a third of men knew that EC could be directly dispensed by pharmacists; even fewer knew that the legal access age for EC was 17 years (13%) or that men could access EC from pharmacies for their female partners (24%). Although respondents most commonly reported that friends were their source of current information about EC, both men and women chose health care professionals as their desired source of future information about EC. CONCLUSIONS: Young men in this sample were significantly less knowledgeable than young women about EC. Educating young men about EC by health care providers during routine visits may be a unique opportunity to increase EC knowledge, access and use among low-income young couples to decrease undesired pregnancies.",Missing

A retrospective cohort design was used to examine data from the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation (UDSMR(R)) for 7434 patients with total knee replacement (TKR) and 4765 patients with total hip replacement (THR) who received rehabilitation from 2008 to 2010. Functional Independence Measure (FIM) instrument ratings were obtained at admission, discharge, and 80-180 days after discharge. Random coefficient regression analyses using linear mixed models were used to estimate mean ratings for items within the four motor subscales (self-care, sphincter control, transfers, and locomotion) and the cognitive domain of the FIM instrument. Mean improvements at discharge for motor items ranged from 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14, 1.19) to 2.69 (95% CI: 2.66, 2.71) points for sphincter control and locomotion, respectively.

24500685,Smoking and snus use onset: exploring the influence of snus debut age on the risk for smoking uptake with cross-sectional survey data.,Nicotine Tob Res,Lund I and Scheffels J,Missing,"INTRODUCTION: Snus use has become increasingly prevalent among young people in Norway, while smoking has declined. Little is known about the transitions between snus and other tobacco products, particularly among younger users. A major concern involves the association between snus initiation and future smoking uptake. METHODS: A total of 409 lifetime snus users who had started with snus before cigarettes or were never-smokers were selected from a national sample of participants in annually repeated cross-sectional surveys (2005-2011) of Norwegian men and women aged 15-74 years. About 30% of them were lifetime smokers, 84% were men, and the mean age was 29.4 years. Logistic regression was applied to investigate the association between age of snus uptake and the risk for becoming a smoker later on. RESULTS: Respondents who started using snus before the age of 16 years had an odds ratio of 3.1 (confidence interval = 1.98-4.76) of being lifetime smokers compared with those who initiated snus later. The prevalence of current smoking among early snus initiators (22.9%) was comparable to that found among never-snus-users (29.6%). Among late snus initiators, current smoking prevalence was 5.9%. CONCLUSION: In this study, snus debut age was an important factor for the association between snus use and smoking.",Missing

METHODS: Preterm infants between 34 0/7 and 35 6/7 weeks' postmenstrual age, including those with brain injury, who were taking at least half their feedings enterally and less than half orally, were randomly assigned to receive 5 daily 15-minute sessions of either PAM with mother's recorded voice or no PAM, along with routine nonnutritive sucking and maternal care in both groups. Assignment was masked to the clinical team. RESULTS: Ninety-four infants (46 and 48 in the PAM intervention and control groups, respectively) completed the study. The intervention group had significantly increased oral feeding rate (2.0 vs. 0.9 mL/min, P < .001), oral volume intake (91.1 vs. 48.1 mL/kg/d, P = .001), oral feeds/day (6.5 vs. 4.0, P < .001), and faster time-to-full oral feedings (31 vs. 38 d, P = .04) compared with controls. Weight gain and cortisol levels during the 5-day protocol were not different between groups. Average hospital stays were 20% shorter in the PAM group, but the difference was not significant (P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: A PAM using mother's voice improves oral feeding skills in preterm infants without adverse effects on hormonal stress or growth.","Feeding Behavior/physiology/*psychology Female Humans Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature/physiology/*psychology Male Mother-Child Relations/*psychology Music/*psychology *Pacifiers/utilization Prospective Studies *Singing/physiology Sucking Behavior/physiology"
24494939,"Associations between obesity and overweight and fall risk, health status and quality of life in older people.",Aust N Z J Public Health,Mitchell RJ and Lord SR and Harvey LA and Close JC,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether overweight and obese individuals have higher reported fall and fall injury risk than individuals of healthy weight, and to examine the influence of BMI on health, quality of life and lifestyle characteristics of fallers. METHODS: A representative sample of community-based individuals aged 65 years and older in New South Wales was surveyed regarding their history of falls, height, weight, lifestyle and general health within a 12-month period. RESULTS: Obese individuals had a 31% higher risk of having fallen, but no higher risk of a fall-related injury compared to healthy-weight individuals. Obese fallers also had a 57% higher risk of believing nothing could be done to prevent falls; a 41% higher risk of using four or more medications; a 30% higher risk of experiencing moderate or extreme pain or discomfort; were 26% less likely have walked for two or more hours in the last week; and were less likely to think they were doing enough physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Older obese individuals have an increased risk of falls and obese fallers have a higher prevalence of pain and inactivity than fallers of a healthy weight. IMPLICATIONS: A decrease in sedentary lifestyle and regular weight-bearing exercise may reduce fall risk in older obese individuals.",Missing
24520130,Community characteristics associated with smokefree park policies in the United States.,Nicotine Tob Res,Hood NE and Bernat DH and Ferketich AK and Danesh D and Klein EG,Missing,"INTRODUCTION: Outdoor smokefree (SF) policies have the potential to decrease secondhand smoke exposure and denormalize smoking. In order to inform dissemination and evaluation of this emergent tobacco control strategy, this study examined the prevalence of SF park policies in the United States and the community-level characteristics associated with enactment of such policies. METHODS: Counties with existing SF park policies in one or more jurisdictions were identified using passive surveillance data from the American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation (ANR). ANR data were validated in a random subsample of counties. County-level characteristics were obtained from public data sources and included population demographics, socioeconomic status (SES), urbanicity, and voter affiliation. State-level tobacco control variables included presence of indoor SF policies and adult smoking prevalence. General estimating equations were used to identify predictors of having a SF park policy while accounting for clustering of counties within states. RESULTS: Eleven percent (n = 355) of counties in the United States (n = 3,143) had at least 1 jurisdiction with a SF park policy. The odds of a county having a SF park policy decreased as the percentage of older residents, recent movers, and smokers increased, and the odds increased as the percentage of Democratic voters increased. Odds were higher for counties with higher SES versus low-SES counties and urban/suburban versus rural counties. CONCLUSIONS: SF park policies are currently limited to relatively few jurisdictions, and there is evidence of disparities in adoption of these policies. Public health practitioners should focus promotion of SF park policies on low-SES communities with children and youth and rural areas.",Missing
24574238,Predictors of new-onset widespread pain in older adults: results from a population-based prospective cohort study in the UK.,Arthritis Rheumatol,McBeth J and Lacey RJ and Wilkie R,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: In older adults, widespread pain (WP) is common, although its etiology is unclear. This study sought to identify factors associated with an increased risk of developing WP in adults age >/=50 years. METHODS: A population-based prospective study was conducted. A baseline questionnaire was administered to subjects to collect data on pain, psychological status, lifestyle and health behaviors, and sociodemographic and clinical factors. Participants free of WP (as defined by the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for fibromyalgia) were followed up for 3 years, and those with new-onset WP at followup were identified. Logistic regression analyses were used to test the relationship between baseline factors and new-onset WP. Multiple imputation was used to test the results for sensitivity to missing data. RESULTS: In this population-based study, 4,326 subjects (1,562 reporting no pain at baseline and 2,764 reporting some pain at baseline) participated at followup. Of these participants, 800 (18.5%) reported a status of new WP at followup (of whom, 121 [7.7%] had reported no pain at baseline and 679 [24.6%] had reported some pain at baseline). The majority of the study factors were associated with new-onset WP. However, only a few factors showed a persistent association with new-onset WP in the multivariate analysis, including age (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.96-0.99), baseline pain status (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.08-1.2), anxiety (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.01-2.1), physical health-related quality of life (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5), cognitive complaint (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.04-1.6), and nonrestorative sleep (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.8). These associations persisted after adjustment for the presence of diffuse osteoarthritis (OA), which led to a modest increase in model fit (C-statistic 0.738, compared with 0.731 in the model excluding diffuse OA). The results were not sensitive to missing data. CONCLUSION: Of the factors measured in this study, nonrestorative sleep was the strongest independent predictor of new-onset WP.","Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Anxiety/diagnosis Cohort Studies Depression/diagnosis Female Fibromyalgia/*diagnosis/psychology Great Britain Health Status Humans Male Middle Aged Osteoarthritis/*diagnosis/psychology Pain/*diagnosis/psychology Pain Measurement Prospective Studies Quality of Life Questionnaires Risk Factors Social Behavior Social Support"

METHODS: Participants were 176 high school students who indicated their use of technology to communicate with partners about condoms, birth control, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV/AIDS, pregnancy, and sexual limits. Sexually active youth also reported their frequency of condom use. RESULTS: Many adolescents (49%) used technology to discuss sexual health with partners, with rates varying by topic. Girls were more likely than boys to discuss HIV, pregnancy, and sexual limits. Ethnic minorities were more likely than whites to discuss condoms, STIs, HIV, pregnancy, and birth control. Importantly, rates of consistent condom use were three times higher among youth using technology to discuss condoms and birth control. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide novel preliminary evidence regarding adolescents' use of technology to discuss sexual health and demonstrate links between technology-based communication and condom use among sexually active youth.",Missing

METHODS: A statewide observational survey of boaters was conducted between August 2010 and September 2010. Data collection included age, sex, life jacket use, boat type, and weather and water conditions. RESULTS: Among 5157 boaters, 30.7% wore life jackets. Life jacket use was highest among groups required by state law: personal watercraft users (96.8%), people being towed (eg, water-skiers) (95.3%) and children 0-12 years old (81.7%). Children and youth were more likely to use a life jacket if any adult in the boat wore a life jacket: 100% versus 87.2% for 0-5 years, 92.8% versus 76.7% for 6-12 years and 81.4% versus 36.1% for 13-17 years. Adult role modelling was particularly beneficial for adolescents aged 13-17 years, who were not covered by a life jacket law. In multivariable analysis, the presence of at least one adult wearing a life jacket was associated with a 20-fold increased likelihood that adolescents were also wearing a life jacket. CONCLUSIONS: Highest life jacket use was strongly associated with laws requiring use and with adult role modelling. Legislation requiring life jackets for ages 13-17 years and social marketing encouraging adult life jacket wear in the company of children and youth are promising strategies to increase life jacket use in Washington State.",Missing

The efficacy of a home exercise program with minimal supervision after formal hip fracture rehabilitation ends has not been established. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a home exercise program with minimal contact with a physical therapist improved function after formal hip fracture rehabilitation ended. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial conducted from September 2008 to October 2012 in the homes of 232 functionally limited older adults who had completed traditional rehabilitation after a hip fracture. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group (n = 120) received functionally oriented exercises (such as standing from a chair, climbing a step) taught by a physical therapist and performed independently by the participants in their homes for 6 months. The attention control group (n = 112) received in-home and telephone-based cardiovascular nutrition education. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Physical function assessed at baseline, 6 months (ie, at completion of the intervention), and 9 months by blinded assessors. The primary outcome was change in function at 6 months measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; range 0-12, higher score indicates better function) and the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) mobility and daily activity (range, 23-85 and 9-101, higher score indicates better function). RESULTS: Among the 232 randomized patients, 195 were followed up at 6 months and included in the primary analysis. The intervention group (n=100) showed significant improvement relative to the control group (n=95) in functional mobility (mean SPPB scores for intervention group: 6.2 [SD, 2.7] at baseline, 7.2 [SD, 3] at 6 months; control group: 6.0 [SD, 2.8] at baseline, 6.2 [SD, 3] at 6 months; and between-group differences: 0.8 [95% CI, 0.4 to 1.2], P < .001; mean AM-PAC mobility scores for intervention group: 56.2 [SD, 7.3] at baseline, 58.1 [SD, 7.9] at 6 months; control group: 56 [SD, 7.1] at baseline, 56.6 [SD, 8.1] at 6 months; and between-group difference, 1.3 [95% CI, 0.2 to 2.4], P = .03; and mean AM-PAC daily activity scores for intervention group: 57.4 [SD, 13.7] at baseline, 61.3 [SD, 15.7] at 6 months; control group: 58.2 [SD, 15.2] at baseline, 58.6 [SD, 15.3] at 6 months; and between-group difference, 3.5 [95% CI, 0.9 to 6.0], P = .03). In multiple imputation analyses, between-group differences remained significant for SPPB and AM-PAC daily activity, but not for mobility. Significant between-group differences persisted at 9 months for all functional measures with and without imputation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients who had completed standard rehabilitation after hip fracture, the use of a home-based functionally oriented exercise program resulted in modest improvement in physical function at 6 months after randomization. The clinical importance of these findings remains to be determined.

24501110,Spousal relationship quality and cardiovascular risk: dyadic perceptions of relationship ambivalence are associated with coronary-artery calcification.,Psychol Sci,Uchino BN and Smith TW and Berg CA,Missing,"The quality of spousal relationships has been related to physical-health outcomes. However, most studies have focused on relationship positivity or negativity in isolation, despite the fact that many close relationships are characterized by both positive and negative aspects (i.e., ambivalence). In addition, most work has not accounted for the reciprocal nature of close-relationship processes that can have an impact on health. Using a sample of 136 older married couples, we tested whether actor-partner models of relationships that were either primarily positive or ambivalent (i.e., perceived as having both helpful and upsetting aspects) predicted measures of coronary-artery calcification. Results revealed an Actor x Partner interaction whereby coronary-artery calcification scores were highest for individuals who both viewed and were viewed by their spouse as ambivalent. These data are discussed in light of the importance of considering both positive and negative aspects of relationship quality and modeling the interdependence of close relationships.",Missing

The study was a three-armed randomized, single-blind, and controlled trial, with follow-ups at one and two years after interventions. A total of 459 persons aged 80 years or older and still living at home were included in the study. Participants were independent in ADL and without overt cognitive impairment. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. The result shows that both interventions delayed a progression in morbidity, i.e. an increase in CIRS-G score (OR=0.44 for the PHV and OR=0.61 for senior meetings at one year and OR=0.60 for the PHV and OR=0.52 for the senior meetings at two years) and maintained satisfaction with health (OR=0.49 for PHV and OR=0.57 for senior meetings at one year and OR=0.43 for the PHV and OR=0.28 for senior meetings after two years) for up to two years. The intervention senior meetings prevented a decline in self-rated health for up to one year (OR=0.55). However, no significant differences were seen in postponing progression of symptoms in any of the interventions. This study shows that it is possible to postpone a decline in health outcomes measured as morbidity, self-rated health and satisfaction with health in very old persons at risk of frailty. Success factors might be the multi-dimensional and the multi-professional approach in both interventions. Trial registration: NCT0087705.",Missing

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted an analysis of prospective singleton term pregnancies in which 1053 overweight and obese women gained >5 kg (14.4 +/- 6.2 kg) or 188 who either lost or gained </=5 kg (1.1 +/- 4.4 kg). Birthweight, fat mass, and lean mass were assessed using anthropometry. Small for gestational age (SGA) was defined as </=10th percentile of a standard US population. Univariable and multivariable analysis evaluated the association between weight change and neonatal morphometry. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in age, race, smoking, parity, or gestational age between groups. Weight loss or gain </=5 kg was associated with SGA, 18/188 (9.6%) vs 51/1053 (4.9%); (adjusted odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.7; P = .003).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation were identified from an international registry; 5,783 women completed a baseline questionnaire and >/= one follow-up questionnaires. Women were observed until either diagnosis of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, death, or date of most recent follow-up. Hazard ratios (HRs) for cancer incidence and all-cause mortality associated with oophorectomy were evaluated using time-dependent survival analyses. RESULTS: After an average follow-up period of 5.6 years, 186 women developed either ovarian (n = 132), fallopian (n = 22), or peritoneal (n = 32) cancer, of whom 68 have died. HR for ovarian, fallopian, or peritoneal cancer associated with bilateral oophorectomy was 0.20 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.30; P < .001). Among women who had no history of cancer at baseline, HR for all-cause mortality to age 70 years associated with an oophorectomy was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.39; P < .001).

However, this risk has not been well quantified, and few large population studies have examined partner bereavement. OBJECTIVE To compare the rate of cardiovascular events between older individuals whose partner dies with those of a matched control group of individuals whose partner was still alive on the same day. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Matched cohort study using a UK primary care database containing availale data of 401 general practices from February 2005 through September 2012. In all, 30 447 individuals aged 60 to 89 years at study initiation who experienced partner bereavement during follow-up were matched by age, sex, and general practice with the nonbereaved control group (n = 83 588) at the time of bereavement. EXPOSURES Partner bereavement. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was occurrence of a fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke within 30 days of bereavement. Secondary outcomes were non-MI acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary embolism. All outcomes were compared between the groups during prespecified periods after bereavement (30, 90, and 365 days). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) from a conditional Poisson model were adjusted for age, smoking status, deprivation, and history of cardiovascular disease. RESULTS Within 30 days of their partner's death, 50 of the bereaved group (0.16%) experienced an MI or a stroke compared with 67 of the matched nonbereaved controls (0.08%) during the same period (IRR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.52-3.15]). The increased risk was seen in bereaved men and women and attenuated after 30 days. For individual outcomes, the increased risk was found separately for MI (IRR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.20-3.81]) and stroke (2.40 [1.22-4.71]). Associations with rarer events were also seen after bereavement, including elevated risk of non-MI acute coronary syndrome (IRR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.12-4.29]) and pulmonary embolism (2.37 [1.18-4.75]) in the first 90 days. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study provides further evidence that the death of a partner is associated with a range of major cardiovascular events in the immediate weeks and months after bereavement.

Research data suggest that acetaminophen is a hormone disruptor, and abnormal hormonal exposures in pregnancy may influence fetal brain development. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether prenatal exposure to acetaminophen increases the risk for developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behavioral problems or hyperkinetic disorders (HKDs) in children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 64,322 live-born children and mothers enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort during 1996-2002. EXPOSURES: Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was assessed prospectively via 3 computer-assisted telephone interviews during pregnancy and 6 months after child birth. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: To ascertain outcome information we used (1) parental reports of behavioral problems in children 7 years of age using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; (2) retrieved HKD diagnoses from the Danish National Hospital Registry or the Danish Psychiatric Central Registry prior to 2011; and (3) identified ADHD prescriptions (mainly Ritalin) for children from the Danish Prescription Registry. We estimated hazard ratios for receiving an HKD diagnosis or using ADHD medications and risk ratios for behavioral problems in children after prenatal exposure to acetaminophen. RESULTS: More than half of all mothers reported acetaminophen use while pregnant. Children whose mothers used acetaminophen during pregnancy were at higher risk for receiving a hospital diagnosis of HKD (hazard ratio = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.19-1.59), use of ADHD medications (hazard ratio = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.15-1.44), or having ADHD-like behaviors at age 7 years (risk ratio = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27). Stronger associations were observed with use in more than 1 trimester during pregnancy, and exposure response trends were found with increasing frequency of acetaminophen use during gestation for all outcomes (ie, HKD diagnosis, ADHD medication use, and ADHD-like behaviors; P trend < .001). Results did not appear to be confounded by maternal inflammation, infection during pregnancy, the mother's mental health problems, or other potential confounders we evaluated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk for HKDs and ADHD-like behaviors in children. Because the exposure and outcome are frequent, these results are of public health relevance but further investigations are needed.","Acetaminophen/*adverse effects Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology Child Child, Preschool Denmark Female Humans Hyperkinesis/*chemically induced/diagnosis Infant Male Mental Disorders/*chemically induced/epidemiology Mothers Pregnancy Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Assessment Risk Factors"

Concerns have been raised about the risk of fall injuries in older adults taking antihypertensive medications. The low risk of fall injuries reported in clinical trials of healthy older adults may not reflect the risk in older adults with multiple chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE To determine whether antihypertensive medication use was associated with experiencing a serious fall injury in a nationally representative sample of older adults. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND SETTING Competing risk analysis as performed with propensity score adjustment and matching in the nationally representative Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey cohort during a 3-year follow-up through 2009. Participants included 4961 community-living adults older than 70 years with hypertension. EXPOSURES Antihypertensive medication intensity based on the standardized daily dose for each antihypertensive medication class that participants used. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Serious fall injuries, including hip and other major fractures, traumatic brain injuries, and joint dislocations, ascertained through Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services claims. RESULTS Of the 4961 participants, 14.1% received no antihypertensive medications; 54.6% were in the moderate-intensity and 31.3% in the high-intensity antihypertensive groups. During follow-up, 446 participants (9.0%) experienced serious fall injuries, and 837 (16.9%) died. The adjusted hazard ratios for serious fall injury were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.03-1.90) in the moderate-intensity and 1.28 (95% CI, 0.91-1.80) in the high-intensity antihypertensive groups compared with nonusers. Although the difference in adjusted hazard ratios across the groups did not reach statistical significance, results were similar in the propensity score-matched subcohort. Among 503 participants with a previous fall injury, the adjusted hazard ratios were 2.17 (95% CI, 0.98-4.80) for the moderate-intensity and 2.31 (95% CI, 1.01-5.29) for the high-intensity antihypertensive groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Antihypertensive medications were associated with an increased risk of serious fall injuries, particularly among those with previous fall injuries.

We assessed among pediatricians and family physicians satisfaction with insurance payment for vaccine purchase and administration by payer type, the proportion who have considered discontinuing provision of all childhood vaccines for financial reasons, and strategies used for handling uncertainty about insurance coverage when new vaccines first become available. METHODS: A national survey among private pediatricians and family physicians April to September 2011. RESULTS: Response rates were 69% (190/277) for pediatricians and 70% (181/260) for family physicians. Level of dissatisfaction varied significantly by payer type for payment for vaccine administration (Medicaid, 63%; Children's Health Insurance Program, 56%; managed care organizations, 48%; preferred provider organizations, 38%; fee for service, 37%; P < .001), but not for payment for vaccine purchase (health maintenance organization or managed care organization, 52%; Child Health Insurance Program, 47%; preferred provider organization, 45%; fee for service, 41%; P = .11). Ten percent of physicians had seriously considered discontinuing providing all childhood vaccines to privately insured patients because of cost issues. The most commonly used strategy for handling uncertainty about insurance coverage for new vaccines was to inform parents that they may be billed for the vaccine; 67% of physicians reported using 3 or more strategies to handle this uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: Many primary care physicians are dissatisfied with payment for vaccine purchase and administration from third-party payers, particularly public insurance for vaccine administration. Physicians report a variety of strategies for dealing with the uncertainty of insurance coverage for new vaccines.","Adult *Attitude of Health Personnel Data Collection/methods Female Humans Male Middle Aged *Physician's Role Physicians, Primary Care/*economics Vaccines/*economics"

OBJECTIVE To determine whether antihypertensive medication use was associated with experiencing a serious fall injury in a nationally representative sample of older adults. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND SETTING Competing risk analysis as performed with propensity score adjustment and matching in the nationally representative Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey cohort during a 3-year follow-up through 2009. Participants included 4961 community-living adults older than 70 years with hypertension. EXPOSURES Antihypertensive medication intensity based on the standardized daily dose for each antihypertensive medication class that participants used. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Serious fall injuries, including hip and other major fractures, traumatic brain injuries, and joint dislocations, ascertained through Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services claims. RESULTS Of the 4961 participants, 14.1% received no antihypertensive medications; 54.6% were in the moderate-intensity and 31.3% in the high-intensity antihypertensive groups. During follow-up, 446 participants (9.0%) experienced serious fall injuries, and 837 (16.9%) died. The adjusted hazard ratios for serious fall injury were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.03-1.90) in the moderate-intensity and 1.28 (95% CI, 0.91-1.80) in the high-intensity antihypertensive groups compared with nonusers. Although the difference in adjusted hazard ratios across the groups did not reach statistical significance, results were similar in the propensity score-matched subcohort. Among 503 participants with a previous fall injury, the adjusted hazard ratios were 2.17 (95% CI, 0.98-4.80) for the moderate-intensity and 2.31 (95% CI, 1.01-5.29) for the high-intensity antihypertensive groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Antihypertensive medications were associated with an increased risk of serious fall injuries, particularly among those with previous fall injuries. The potential harms vs benefits of antihypertensive medications should be weighed in deciding to continue treatment with antihypertensive medications in older adults with multiple chronic conditions.","Accidental Falls/*statistics & numerical data Aged Aged, 80 and over Antihypertensive Agents/*adverse effects Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (U.S.) Female Humans Male Propensity Score Risk United States/epidemiology Wounds and Injuries/*epidemiology"
24500590,Obesity and its effects on pediatric supracondylar humeral fractures.,J Bone Joint Surg Am,Seeley MA and Gagnier JJ and Srinivasan RC and Hensinger RN and VanderHave KL and Farley FA and Caird MS,umich,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the effects of childhood obesity on fracture complexity and associated injuries in pediatric supracondylar humeral fractures. METHODS: A billing query identified all patients who were two to eleven years of age and had undergone operative treatment for extension-type supracondylar humeral fractures over a 12.5-year period. Records were reviewed for demographic data, body mass index percentile, and injury data. Complex fractures were defined as type-3 supracondylar humeral fractures, supracondylar humeral fractures with intercondylar extension, or supracondylar humeral fractures with ipsilateral upper-extremity fractures. Logistic regression analyses were used to test relationships among body mass index subgroups, fracture complexity, elbow motion, preoperative and postoperative neurovascular status, and complications. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-four patients met our inclusion criteria. Forty-one children were underweight (BMI in the <5th percentile), 182 were normal weight (BMI in the 5th to 85th percentile), sixty-three were overweight (BMI in the >85th to 95th percentile), and sixty-eight were obese (BMI in the >95th percentile). There were 149 patients, eleven of whom were obese, with isolated type-2 fractures and 205 patients, fifty-seven of whom were obese, with complex fractures. Thirty-two patients had preoperative nerve palsies and twenty-eight patients had postoperative nerve palsies. Using logistic regression, obesity was associated with complex fractures (odds ratio, 9.19 [95% confidence interval, 4.25 to 19.92]; p < 0.001), preoperative nerve palsies (odds ratio, 2.69 [95% confidence interval, 1.15 to 6.29]; p = 0.02), postoperative nerve palsies (odds ratio, 7.69 [95% confidence interval, 2.66 to 22.31]; p < 0.001), and postoperative complications (odds ratio, 4.03 [95% confidence interval, 1.72 to 9.46]; p < 0.001). Additionally, obese patients were more likely to sustain complex fractures from a fall on an outstretched hand than normal-weight patients (odds ratio, 13.00 [95% confidence interval, 3.44 to 49.19]; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is associated with more complex supracondylar humeral fractures, preoperative and postoperative nerve palsies, and postoperative complications. To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the implications of obesity on supracondylar humeral fracture complexity and associated injuries and it validates public health efforts in combating childhood obesity.","Accidental Falls/statistics & numerical data Body Mass Index Child Child, Preschool Female Fracture Fixation/methods/statistics & numerical data Humans Humeral Fractures/*etiology/physiopathology/surgery Male Mononeuropathies/etiology Obesity/*complications/physiopathology Postoperative Complications/etiology/physiopathology Range of Motion, Articular/physiology Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Treatment Outcome"
24499096,Health habits and other characteristics of dietary supplement users: a review.,Nutr J,Dickinson A and MacKay D,Missing,"Dietary supplements are used by half to two-thirds of American adults, and the evidence suggests that this usage is one component of a larger effort to develop a healthier lifestyle. Dietary supplement users tend on average to be better educated and to have somewhat higher incomes than nonusers, and these factors may contribute to their health-consciousness. Dietary supplement use also tends to be more prevalent among women than among men, and the prevalence of use increases with age in both men and women. Numerous surveys document that users of dietary supplements are significantly more likely than nonusers to have somewhat better dietary patterns, exercise regularly, maintain a healthy weight, and avoid tobacco products. While supplement users tend to have better diets than nonusers, the differences are relatively small, their diets have some substantial nutrient shortfalls, and their supplement use has been shown to improve the adequacy of nutrient intakes. Overall, the evidence suggests that users of dietary supplements are seeking wellness and are consciously adopting a variety of lifestyle habits that they consider to contribute to healthy living.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of indoor tanning and frequent indoor tanning (>/=10 times during the 12 months before each survey) and their association with health-related behaviors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study examined data from the 2009 and 2011 national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys, which used nationally representative samples of US high school students representing approximately 15.5 million students each survey year. The study included 25,861 students who answered the indoor tanning question. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The prevalence of indoor tanning and frequent indoor tanning were examined as well as their association with demographic characteristics and health-related behaviors using multivariable logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: The prevalence of indoor tanning was greater among female, older, and non-Hispanic white students. Indoor tanning was highest among female students aged 18 years or older, with 31.5% engaging in indoor tanning in 2011, and among non-Hispanic white female students, with 29.3% engaging in indoor tanning in 2011. Among female students, the adjusted prevalence of indoor tanning decreased from 26.4% in 2009 to 20.7% in 2011. Among female and male students, indoor tanning was associated with other risk-taking behaviors, such as binge drinking (P < .001 and P = .006, respectively), unhealthy weight control practices (P < .001, for both), and having sexual intercourse (P < .001, for both). Additionally, indoor tanning among female students was associated with using illegal drugs (P < .001) and having sexual intercourse with 4 or more persons (P = .03); use among male students was associated with taking steroids without a physician's prescription (P < .001), smoking cigarettes daily (P = .03), and attempting suicide (P = .006). More than half of respondents engaging in indoor tanning reported frequent use of the devices. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Indoor tanning is common among high school students. Public health efforts are needed to change social norms regarding tanned skin and to increase awareness, knowledge, and behaviors related to indoor tanning. The clustering of risky behaviors suggests a need for coordinated, multifaceted approaches, including primary care physician counseling, to address such behaviors among adolescents.",Adolescent Adolescent Behavior/*ethnology Age Factors Beauty Culture/*methods Cross-Sectional Studies Female Health Behavior Humans Incidence Male Needs Assessment Risk-Taking Sex Factors Students/statistics & numerical data Sunbathing/*statistics & numerical data Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects United States

No convincing evidence exists for the persistence of viable spirochetes after recommended courses of antibiotic therapy in humans. We determined the safety of using I. scapularis larvae for the xenodiagnosis of B. burgdorferi infection in humans. METHODS: Laboratory-reared larval I. scapularis ticks were placed on 36 subjects and allowed to feed to repletion. Ticks were tested for B. burgdorferi by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture, and/or isothermal amplification followed by PCR and electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy. In addition, attempts were made to infect immunodeficient mice by tick bite or inoculation of tick contents. Xenodiagnosis was repeated in 7 individuals. RESULTS: Xenodiagnosis was well tolerated with no severe adverse events. The most common adverse event was mild itching at the tick attachment site. Xenodiagnosis was negative in 16 patients with posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) and/or high C6 antibody levels and in 5 patients after completing antibiotic therapy for erythema migrans. Xenodiagnosis was positive for B. burgdorferi DNA in a patient with erythema migrans early during therapy and in a patient with PTLDS. There is insufficient evidence, however, to conclude that viable spirochetes were present in either patient. CONCLUSIONS: Xenodiagnosis using Ixodes scapularis larvae was safe and well tolerated. Further studies are needed to determine the sensitivity of xenodiagnosis in patients with Lyme disease and the significance of a positive result. Clinical Trials Registration NCT01143558.",Missing
24509405,Night-time immobilization of the distal interphalangeal joint reduces pain and extension deformity in hand osteoarthritis.,Rheumatology (Oxford),Watt FE and Kennedy DL and Carlisle KE and Freidin AJ and Szydlo RM and Honeyfield L and Satchithananda K and Vincent TL,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: DIP joint OA is common but has few cost-effective, evidence-based interventions. Pain and deformity [radial or ulnar deviation of the joint or loss of full extension (extension lag)] frequently lead to functional and cosmetic issues. We investigated whether splinting the DIP joint would improve pain, function and deformity. METHODS: A prospective, radiologist-blinded, non-randomized, internally controlled trial of custom splinting of the DIP joint was carried out. Twenty-six subjects with painful, deforming DIP joint hand OA gave written, informed consent. One intervention joint and one control joint were nominated. A custom gutter splint was worn nightly for 3 months on the intervention joint, with clinical and radiological assessment at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Differences in the change were compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: The median average pain at baseline was similar in the intervention (6/10) and control joints (5/10). Average pain (primary outcome measure) and worst pain in the intervention joint were significantly lower at 3 months compared with baseline (P = 0.002, P = 0.02). Differences between intervention and control joint average pain reached significance at 6 months (P = 0.049). Extension lag deformity was significantly improved in intervention joints at 3 months and in splinted joints compared with matched contralateral joints (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Short-term night-time DIP joint splinting is a safe, simple treatment modality that reduces DIP joint pain and improves extension of the digit, and does not appear to give rise to non-compliance, increased stiffness or joint restriction.

24504443,Breaking bad news-what patients want and what they get: evaluating the SPIKES protocol in Germany.,Ann Oncol,Seifart C and Hofmann M and Bar T and Riera Knorrenschild J and Seifart U and Rief W,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the SPIKES protocol, a recommended guideline for breaking bad news, is sparse, and information about patients' preferences for bad-news delivery in Germany is lacking. Being the first actual-theoretical comparison of a 'breaking bad news' guideline, the present study evaluates the recommended steps of the SPIKES protocol. Moreover, emotional consequences and quality of bad-news delivery are investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 350 cancer patients answered the MABBAN (Marburg Breaking Bad News Scale), a questionnaire representing the six SPIKES subscales, asking for the procedure, perception and satisfaction of the first cancer disclosure and patient's assign to these items. RESULTS: Only 46.2% of the asked cancer patients are completely satisfied with how bad news had been broken to them. The overall quality is significantly related to the emotional state after receiving bad news (r = -0.261, P < 0.001). Patients' preferences differ highly significantly from the way bad news were delivered, and the resulting rang list of patients' preferences indicates that the SPIKES protocol do not fully meet the priorities of cancer patients in Germany. CONCLUSIONS: It could be postulated that the low satisfaction of patients observed in this study reflects the highly significant difference between patients' preferences and bad-news delivery. Therefore, some adjunctions to the SPIKES protocol should be considered, including a frequent reassurance of listeners' understanding, the perpetual possibility to ask question, respect for prearrangement needs and the conception of bad-news delivery in a two-step procedure.",Missing

The most prevalent allergy is to house dust mites. Impermeable mattress covers are often the first treatment in the prevention and decrease of symptoms of allergic disease. OBJECTIVE: To perform a meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of impermeable mattress covers in the primary prevention of allergic disease and as a single intervention in the tertiary prevention of allergic disease symptoms. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL were systematically searched for relevant publications. Seven primary prevention trials (n = 3,461) and 17 tertiary prevention trials (n = 1,671) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. All article reviews and abstractions were performed in duplicate. RESULTS: No significant pooled relative risks were found for the prevention of allergic disease. The pooled relative risks were 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-1.51) for house dust mite sensitization, 0.92 (95% CI 0.81-1.05) for wheeze, 0.85 (95% CI 0.70-1.02) for asthma, 1.03 (95% CI 0.90-1.19) for allergic rhinitis, and 1.05 (95% CI 0.84-1.32) for allergic dermatitis. Likewise, no significant pooled standardized mean differences were found in the tertiary prevention of symptoms. The pooled standardized mean differences were -0.03 (95% CI -0.15 to 0.09) for peak flow, -0.06 (95% CI -0.32 to 0.20) for asthma symptom score, and -0.39 (95% CI -0.88 to 0.11) for nasal symptom score. A significant effect was seen in the decrease of house mite dust level in the mattress (-0.79, 95% CI -0.98 to -0.60).

24674352,"Readability, suitability, and health content assessment of web-based patient education materials on colorectal cancer screening.",Gastrointest Endosc,Tian C and Champlin S and Mackert M and Lazard A and Agrawal D,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in the Unites States are still below target level. Web-based patient education materials are used by patients and providers to provide supplemental information on CRC screening. Low literacy levels and patient perceptions are significant barriers to screening. There are little data on the quality of these online materials from a health literacy standpoint or whether they address patients' perceptions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the readability, suitability, and health content of web-based patient education materials on colon cancer screening. DESIGN: Descriptive study. SETTING: Web-based patient materials. INTERVENTIONS: Twelve reputable and popular online patient education materials were evaluated. Readability was measured by using the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Grade Level, and suitability was determined by the Suitability Assessment of Materials, a scale that considers characteristics such as content, graphics, layout/typography, and learning stimulation. Health content was evaluated within the framework of the Health Belief Model, a behavioral model that relates patients' perceptions of susceptibility to disease, severity, and benefits and barriers to their medical decisions. Each material was scored independently by 3 reviewers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Flesch-Kincaid Reading Grade Level score, Suitability Assessment of Materials score, health content score. RESULTS: Readability for 10 of 12 materials surpassed the maximum recommended sixth-grade reading level. Five were 10th grade level and above. Only 1 of 12 materials received a superior suitability score; 3 materials received inadequate scores. Health content analysis revealed that only 50% of the resources discussed CRC risk in the general population and <25% specifically addressed patients at high risk, such as African Americans, smokers, patients with diabetes, and obese patients. For perceived barriers to screening, only 8.3% of resources discussed embarrassment, 25% discussed pain with colonoscopy, 25% addressed cost of colonoscopy, and none specifically mentioned the need to get colonoscopy when no symptoms are present. No material discussed the social benefits of screening. LIMITATIONS: Descriptive design. CONCLUSION: Most online patient education materials for CRC screening are written beyond the recommended sixth-grade reading level, with suboptimal suitability. Health content is lacking in addressing key perceived risks, barriers, and benefits to CRC screening. Developing more appropriate and targeted patient education resources on CRC may improve patient understanding and promote screening.",Missing
24747298,Precooling and percooling (cooling during exercise) both improve performance in the heat: a meta-analytical review.,Br J Sports Med,Bongers CC and Thijssen DH and Veltmeijer MT and Hopman MT and Eijsvogels TM,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Exercise increases core body temperature (Tc), which is necessary to optimise physiological processes. However, excessive increase in Tc may impair performance and places participants at risk for the development of heat-related illnesses. Cooling is an effective strategy to attenuate the increase in Tc. This meta-analysis compares the effects of cooling before (precooling) and during exercise (percooling) on performance and physiological outcomes. METHODS: A computerised literature search, citation tracking and hand search were performed up to May 2013. 28 studies met the inclusion criteria, which were trials that examined the effects of cooling strategies on exercise performance in men, while exercise was performed in the heat (>30 degrees C). 20 studies used precooling, while 8 studies used percooling. RESULTS: The overall effect of precooling and percooling interventions on exercise performance was +6.7+/-0.9% (effect size (ES)=0.43). We found a comparable effect (p=0.82) of precooling (+5.7+/-1.0% (ES=0.44)) and percooling (+9.9+/-1.9% (ES=0.40)) to improve exercise performance. A lower finishing Tc was found in precooling (38.9 degrees C) compared with control condition (39.1 degrees C, p=0.03), while Tc was comparable between conditions in percooling studies. No correlation between Tc and performance was found. We found significant differences between cooling strategies, with a combination of multiple techniques being most effective for precooling (p<0.01) and ice vest for percooling (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Cooling can significantly improve exercise performance in the heat. We found a comparable ES for precooling and percooling on exercise performance, while the type of cooling technique importantly impacts the effects. Precooling lowered the finishing core temperature, while there was no correlation between Tc and performance.",Missing

We evaluated the association of Family-Link use on the reduction in stress experienced by children during hospitalization. METHODS: We offered Family-Link to pediatric patients who had an expected length of hospitalization equal to or greater than 4 days. We measured the stress levels of hospitalized children at admission and discharge using the previously published Parental Stress Survey. We used propensity score matching and multivariable linear regression methods to evaluate the relationship between the use of Family-Link and stress experienced by children during hospitalization. RESULTS: We included a total of 367 children in the study: 232 Family-Link users and 135 non-Family-Link users. Using the propensity score matching method, we found that the use of Family-Link was significantly associated with a greater reduction in overall mean stress compared with non-Family-Link users among the cohort of patients who lived closer to the hospital and had shorter lengths of hospitalization (beta = 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.43; P < .05). In this cohort, the reduction in overall mean stress was 37% greater among Family-Link users than non-Family-Link users. CONCLUSIONS: The use of videoconferencing by some hospitalized children and families to conduct virtual visits with family and friends outside of the hospital was associated with a greater reduction in stress during hospitalization than those who did not use videoconferencing.","Child Child, Hospitalized/*psychology Female Hospitalization Humans Male *Parents Propensity Score Prospective Studies Stress, Psychological/*prevention & control *Videoconferencing"

Among these, an emerging approach is the use of virtual reality (VR) within exposure-based protocols for anxiety disorders, and in particular posttraumatic stress disorder. However, no systematically tested VR protocols are available for the management of psychological stress. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a new technological paradigm, Interreality, for the management and prevention of psychological stress. The main feature of Interreality is a twofold link between the virtual and the real world achieved through experiential virtual scenarios (fully controlled by the therapist, used to learn coping skills and improve self-efficacy) with real-time monitoring and support (identifying critical situations and assessing clinical change) using advanced technologies (virtual worlds, wearable biosensors, and smartphones). METHODS: The study was designed as a block randomized controlled trial involving 121 participants recruited from two different worker populations-teachers and nurses-that are highly exposed to psychological stress. Participants were a sample of teachers recruited in Milan (Block 1: n=61) and a sample of nurses recruited in Messina, Italy (Block 2: n=60). Participants within each block were randomly assigned to the (1) Experimental Group (EG): n=40; B1=20, B2=20, which received a 5-week treatment based on the Interreality paradigm; (2) Control Group (CG): n=42; B1=22, B2=20, which received a 5-week traditional stress management training based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); and (3) the Wait-List group (WL): n=39, B1=19, B2=20, which was reassessed and compared with the two other groups 5 weeks after the initial evaluation. RESULTS: Although both treatments were able to significantly reduce perceived stress better than WL, only EG participants reported a significant reduction (EG=12% vs. CG=0.5%) in chronic ""trait"" anxiety. A similar pattern was found for coping skills: both treatments were able to significantly increase most coping skills, but only EG participants reported a significant increase (EG=14% vs CG=0.3%) in the Emotional Support skill. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide initial evidence that the Interreality protocol yields better outcomes than the traditionally accepted gold standard for psychological stress treatment: CBT. Consequently, these findings constitute a sound foundation and rationale for the importance of continuing future research in technology-enhanced protocols for psychological stress management.
