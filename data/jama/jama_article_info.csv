24687165,Arterial stiffness and beta-amyloid progression in nondemented elderly adults.,JAMA Neurol,Hughes TM and Kuller LH and Barinas-Mitchell EJ and McDade EM and Klunk WE and Cohen AD and Mathis CA and Dekosky ST and Price JC and Lopez OL,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Recent studies show that cerebral beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition is associated with blood pressure and measures of arterial stiffness in nondemented individuals. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between measures of arterial stiffness and change in Abeta deposition over time. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Deposition of Abeta was determined in a longitudinal observational study of aging by positron emission tomography using the Pittsburgh compound B twice 2 years apart in 81 nondemented individuals 83 years and older. Arterial stiffness was measured with a noninvasive and automated waveform analyzer at the time closest to the second positron emission tomography scan. All measures were performed under standardized conditions. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured in the central (carotid-femoral and heart-femoral PWV), peripheral (femoral-ankle PWV), and mixed (brachial-ankle PWV) vascular beds. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The change in Abeta deposition over 2 years was calculated from the 81 individuals with repeat Abeta-positron emission tomography. RESULTS: The proportion of Abeta-positive individuals increased from 48% at baseline to 75% at follow-up. Brachial-ankle PWV was significantly higher among Abeta-positive participants at baseline and follow-up. Femoral-ankle PWV was only higher among Abeta-positive participants at follow-up. Measures of central stiffness and blood pressure were not associated with Abeta status at baseline or follow-up, but central stiffness was associated with a change in Abeta deposition over time. Each standard deviation increase in central stiffness (carotid-femoral PWV, P = .001; heart-femoral PWV, P = .004) was linked with increases in Abeta deposition over 2 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study showed that Abeta deposition increases with age in nondemented individuals and that arterial stiffness is strongly associated with the progressive deposition of Abeta in the brain, especially in this age group. The association between Abeta deposition changes over time and generalized arterial stiffness indicated a relationship between the severity of subclinical vascular disease and progressive cerebral Abeta deposition.","Aged, 80 and over Amyloid beta-Peptides/biosynthesis/*metabolism/physiology *Disease Progression Double-Blind Method Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Time Factors Vascular Stiffness/*physiology"
24887073,"The prevalence of confirmed maltreatment among US children, 2004 to 2011.",JAMA Pediatr,Wildeman C and Emanuel N and Leventhal JM and Putnam-Hornstein E and Waldfogel J and Lee H,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Child maltreatment is a risk factor for poor health throughout the life course. Existing estimates of the proportion of the US population maltreated during childhood are based on retrospective self-reports. Records of officially confirmed maltreatment have been used to produce annual rather than cumulative counts of maltreated individuals. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the proportion of US children with a report of maltreatment (abuse or neglect) that was indicated or substantiated by Child Protective Services (referred to as confirmed maltreatment) by 18 years of age. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) Child File includes information on all US children with a confirmed report of maltreatment, totaling 5,689,900 children (2004-2011). We developed synthetic cohort life tables to estimate the cumulative prevalence of confirmed childhood maltreatment by 18 years of age. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The cumulative prevalence of confirmed child maltreatment by race/ethnicity, sex, and year. RESULTS: At 2011 rates, 12.5% (95% CI, 12.5%-12.6%) of US children will experience a confirmed case of maltreatment by 18 years of age. Girls have a higher cumulative prevalence (13.0% [95% CI, 12.9%-13.0%]) than boys (12.0% [12.0%-12.1%]). Black (20.9% [95% CI, 20.8%-21.1%]), Native American (14.5% [14.2%-14.9%]), and Hispanic (13.0% [12.9%-13.1%]) children have higher prevalences than white (10.7% [10.6%-10.8%]) or Asian/Pacific Islander (3.8% [3.7%-3.8%]) children. The risk for maltreatment is highest in the first few years of life; 2.1% (95% CI, 2.1%-2.1%) of children have confirmed maltreatment by 1 year of age, and 5.8% (5.8%-5.9%), by 5 years of age. Estimates from 2011 were consistent with those from 2004 through 2010. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Annual rates of confirmed child maltreatment dramatically understate the cumulative number of children confirmed to be maltreated during childhood. Our findings indicate that maltreatment will be confirmed for 1 in 8 US children by 18 years of age, far greater than the 1 in 100 children whose maltreatment is confirmed annually. For black children, the cumulative prevalence is 1 in 5; for Native American children, 1 in 7.",Missing
23843028,Effect of the 16-hour work limit on general surgery intern operative case volume: a multi-institutional study.,JAMA Surg,Schwartz SI and Galante J and Kaji A and Dolich M and Easter D and Melcher ML and Patel K and Reeves ME and Salim A and Senagore AJ and Takanishi DM Jr and de Virgilio C,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The 80-hour work-week limit for all residents was instituted in 2003 and studies looking at its effect have been mixed. Since the advent of the 16-hour mandate for postgraduate year 1 residents in July 2011, no data have been published regarding the effect of this additional work-hour restriction. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the 16-hour intern work limit, implemented in July 2011, has adversely affected operative experience. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective review of categorical postgraduate year 1 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education case logs from the intern class (N = 52) (with 16-hour work limit) compared with the 4 preceding years (2007-2010; N = 197) (without 16-hour work limit). A total of 249 categorical general surgery interns from 10 general surgery residency programs in the western United States were included. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Total, major, first-assistant, and defined-category case totals. RESULTS: As compared with the preceding 4 years, the 2011-2012 interns recorded a 25.8% decrease in total operative cases (65.9 vs 88.8, P = .005), a 31.8% decrease in major cases (54.9 vs 80.5, P < .001), and a 46.3% decrease in first-assistant cases (11.1 vs 20.7, P = .008). There were statistically significant decreases in cases within the defined categories of abdomen, endocrine, head and neck, basic laparoscopy, complex laparoscopy, pediatrics, thoracic, and soft tissue/breast surgery in the 16-hour shift intern era, whereas there was no decrease in trauma, vascular, alimentary, endoscopy, liver, and pancreas cases. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The 16-hour work limit for interns, implemented in July 2011, is associated with a significant decrease in categorical intern operative experience. If the 16-hour shift were to be extended to all postgraduate year levels, one can anticipate that additional years of training will be needed to maintain the same operative volume.","*Education, Medical, Graduate General Surgery/*education Humans *Internship and Residency Retrospective Studies United States Work Schedule Tolerance Workload/*standards"
24899268,Surgical vs medical treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA Surg,Courcoulas AP and Goodpaster BH and Eagleton JK and Belle SH and Kalarchian MA and Lang W and Toledo FG and Jakicic JM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Many questions remain unanswered about the role of bariatric surgery for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). OBJECTIVE: To determine feasibility of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) and compare initial outcomes of bariatric surgery and a structured weight loss program for treating T2DM in participants with grades I and II obesity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 12-month, 3-arm RCT at a single center including 69 participants aged 25 to 55 years with a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30 to 40 and T2DM. INTERVENTIONS: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), and an intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention (LWLI). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes in the intention-to-treat cohort were feasibility and effectiveness measured by weight loss and improvements in glycemic control. RESULTS: Of 667 potential participants who underwent screening, 69 (10.3%) were randomized. Among the randomized participants, 30 (43%) had grade I obesity, and 56 (81%) were women. Mean (SD) age was 47.3 (6.4) years and hemoglobin A1c level, 7.9% (2.0%). After randomization, 7 participants (10%) refused to undergo their allocated intervention (3 RYGB, 1 LAGB, and 3 LWLI), and 1 RYGB participant was excluded for current smoking. Twenty participants underwent RYGB; 21, LAGB; and 20, LWLI, with 12-month retention rates of 90%, 86%, and 70%, respectively. In the intention-to-treat cohort with multiple imputation for missing data, RYGB participants had the greatest mean weight loss from baseline (27.0%; 95% CI, 30.8-23.3) compared with LAGB (17.3%; 95% CI, 21.1-13.5) and LWLI (10.2%; 95% CI, 14.8-5.61) (P < .001). Partial and complete remission of T2DM were 50% and 17%, respectively, in the RYGB group and 27% and 23%, respectively, in the LAGB group (P < .001 and P = .047 between groups for partial and complete remission), with no remission in the LWLI group. Significant reductions in use of antidiabetics occurred in both surgical groups. No deaths were noted. The 3 serious adverse events included 1 ulcer treated medically in the RYGB group and 2 rehospitalizations for dehydration in the LAGB group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study highlights several potential challenges to successful completion of a larger RCT for treatment of T2DM and obesity in patients with a body mass index of 30 to 40, including the difficulties associated with recruiting and randomizing patients to surgical vs nonsurgical interventions. Preliminary results show that RYGB was the most effective treatment, followed by LAGB for weight loss and T2DM outcomes at 1 year.

24589630,Association of a television in the bedroom with increased adiposity gain in a nationally representative sample of children and adolescents.,JAMA Pediatr,Gilbert-Diamond D and Li Z and Adachi-Mejia AM and McClure AC and Sargent JD,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Obesity affects health in children and adolescents. Television viewing is an established risk factor for obesity in youth. No prospective study has assessed whether a bedroom television confers an additional risk for obesity in youth. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prospective association between the presence of a bedroom television and change in body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), independent of television viewing, in a nationally representative sample of US children and adolescents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a random-digit prospective telephone survey that captured children and adolescents from across the United States. Participants included 6522 boys and girls aged 10 to 14 years at baseline who were surveyed via telephone about media risk factors for obesity.Weighted regressions assessed adiposity at 2- and 4-year follow-up, controlling for television and movie viewing, video-game playing, parenting, age, sex, race or ethnicity, household income, and parental educational level. EXPOSURE: Report of having a television in the bedroom at baseline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age- and sex-adjusted BMI based on self-report and parent report of weight and height at 2- and 4-year follow-up. RESULTS: Distributions for age, sex, race or ethnicity, and socioeconomic status were similar to census estimates for the US population. Sample weighting methods accounted for higher dropout rates among ethnic minorities and those with lower socioeconomic status. Bedroom televisions were reported by 59.1%of participants at baseline, with boys, ethnic minorities, and those of lower socioeconomic status having significantly higher rates. In multivariate analyses, having a bedroom television was associated with an excess BMI of 0.57 (95%CI, 0.31-0.82) and 0.75 (0.38-1.12) at years 2 and 4, respectively, and a BMI gain of 0.24 (0.02-0.45) from years 2 to 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Having a bedroom television is associated with weight gain beyond the effect of television viewing time. This association could be the result of uncaptured effects of television viewing or of disrupted sleep patterns. With the high prevalence of bedroom televisions, the effect attributable to this risk factor among US children and adolescents is excess weight of 8.7 million kg/y.",Adolescent Body Height *Body Mass Index *Body Weight Child Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Prospective Studies Risk Factors Television/*statistics & numerical data United States/epidemiology Video Games/statistics & numerical data

However, we lack data on national patterns of breast MRI use in community practice. OBJECTIVE: To describe patterns of breast MRI use in US community practice during the period 2005 through 2009. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational cohort study using data collected from 2005 through 2009 on breast MRI and mammography from 5 national Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium registries. Data included 8931 breast MRI examinations and 1,288,924 screening mammograms from women aged 18 to 79 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We calculated the rate of breast MRI examinations per 1000 women with breast imaging within the same year and described the clinical indications for the breast MRI examinations by year and age. We compared women screened with breast MRI to women screened with mammography alone for patient characteristics and lifetime breast cancer risk. RESULTS: The overall rate of breast MRI from 2005 through 2009 nearly tripled from 4.2 to 11.5 examinations per 1000 women, with the most rapid increase from 2005 to 2007 (P = .02). The most common clinical indication was diagnostic evaluation (40.3%), followed by screening (31.7%). Compared with women who received screening mammography alone, women who underwent screening breast MRI were more likely to be younger than 50 years, white non-Hispanic, and nulliparous and to have a personal history of breast cancer, a family history of breast cancer, and extremely dense breast tissue (all P < .001). The proportion of women screened using breast MRI at high lifetime risk for breast cancer (>20%) increased during the study period from 9% in 2005 to 29% in 2009. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Use of breast MRI for screening in high-risk women is increasing. However, our findings suggest that there is a need to improve appropriate use, including among women who may benefit from screening breast MRI.",Adolescent Adult Age Factors Aged Breast/*pathology Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis Cohort Studies Early Detection of Cancer/*methods Female Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*utilization Mammography/utilization Middle Aged Risk Factors United States Young Adult
24590048,Predictors of suicide and accident death in the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS): results from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS).,JAMA Psychiatry,Schoenbaum M and Kessler RC and Gilman SE and Colpe LJ and Heeringa SG and Stein MB and Ursano RJ and Cox KL,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) is a multicomponent study designed to generate actionable recommendations to reduce Army suicides and increase knowledge of risk and resilience factors for suicidality. OBJECTIVES: To present data on prevalence, trends, and basic sociodemographic and Army experience correlates of suicides and accident deaths among active duty Regular Army soldiers between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2009, and thereby establish a foundation for future Army STARRS investigations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of trends and predictors of suicide and accident deaths using Army and Department of Defense administrative data systems. Participants were all members of the US Regular Army serving at any time between 2004 and 2009. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Death by suicide or accident during active Army service. RESULTS: The suicide rate rose between 2004 and 2009 among never deployed and currently and previously deployed Regular Army soldiers. The accident death rate fell sharply among currently deployed soldiers, remained constant among the previously deployed, and trended upward among the never deployed. Increased suicide risk was associated with being a man (or a woman during deployment), white race/ethnicity, junior enlisted rank, recent demotion, and current or previous deployment. Sociodemographic and Army experience predictors were generally similar for suicides and accident deaths. Time trends in these predictors and in the Army's increased use of accession waivers (which relaxed some qualifications for new soldiers) do not explain the rise in Army suicides. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Predictors of Army suicides were largely similar to those reported elsewhere for civilians, although some predictors distinct to Army service emerged that deserve more in-depth analysis. The existence of a time trend in suicide risk among never-deployed soldiers argues indirectly against the view that exposure to combat-related trauma is the exclusive cause of the increase in Army suicides.","Accidents, Occupational/prevention & control/*psychology/*trends Adult *Afghan Campaign 2001- Cause of Death/trends Combat Disorders/mortality/prevention & control/psychology Cross-Sectional Studies Female Forecasting Humans Incidence *Iraq War, 2003-2011 Male Military Personnel/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data *Resilience, Psychological Risk Assessment/*methods/*statistics & numerical data Risk Factors Statistics as Topic Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/mortality/prevention & control/psychology Suicide/prevention & control/*psychology/*trends United States Young Adult"

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists induce weight loss by suppressing appetite and increasing satiety, but few studies have evaluated this therapy as a treatment for obesity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of exenatide on body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and cardiometabolic risk factors in adolescents with severe obesity. DESIGN: Three-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial followed by a 3-month open-label extension. SETTING: An academic medical center and an outpatient pediatric endocrinology clinic. PATIENTS: A total of 26 adolescents (12-19 years of age) with severe obesity (BMI >/= 1.2 times the 95th percentile or BMI >/= 35). INTERVENTION: All patients received lifestyle modification counseling and were equally randomized to exenatide or placebo injection, twice per day. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was the mean percent change in BMI measured at baseline and 3 months. Secondary end points included absolute change in BMI, body weight, body fat, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and lipids at 3 months. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients completed the trial. Exenatide elicited a greater reduction in percent change in BMI compared with placebo (-2.70% [95% CI, -5.02% to -0.37%]; P = .03). Similar findings were observed for absolute change in BMI (-1.13 [95% CI, -2.03 to -0.24]; P = .02) and body weight (-3.26 kg [95% CI, -5.87 to -0.66 kg]; P = .02). Although not reaching the level of statistical significance, reduction in systolic blood pressure was observed with exenatide. During the open-label extension, BMI was further reduced in those initially randomized to exenatide (cumulative BMI reduction of 4%).

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether baseline levels of hsCRP and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) predict development and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR), clinically significant macular edema (CSME), retinal hard exudates, and proliferative DR in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) cohort. DESIGN: The DCCT was a large multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Twenty-nine medical centers in the United States and Canada. PARTICIPANTS: The DCCT population consisted of 1441 subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged 13 to 39 years at study entry. INTERVENTION: We measured levels of hsCRP, ICAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1 in stored baseline blood samples. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed the association of levels of hsCRP, ICAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1 with incident DR end points ascertained from grading of standardized 7-field stereoscopic retinal color photographs taken at baseline and every 6 months during follow-up. RESULTS: After adjustment for randomized treatment assignment and other factors, we observed a statistically significant association between hsCRP and risk of CSME, with a relative risk (RR) for the top vs bottom quintile of 1.83 (95% CI, 0.94-3.55; P for trend = .01). Similarly, for the development of retinal hard exudates, the RR for the top vs bottom quintile of hsCRP level was 1.78 (95% CI, 0.98-3.25; P for trend = .004), whereas for ICAM-1 level, the RR comparing the top vs bottom quintiles was 1.50 (95% CI, 0.84-2.68; P for trend = .05). There were no statistically significant associations between baseline VCAM-1 or tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1 levels and risk of any of the DR end points. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: After adjusting for known risk factors, increasing quintiles of baseline hsCRP level may be associated with higher risk of incident CSME and macular hard exudate in the DCCT cohort. Circulating levels of ICAM-1 may also be associated with the development of retinal hard exudates.","Adolescent Adult Biological Markers/*blood C-Reactive Protein/*metabolism Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/complications Diabetic Retinopathy/blood/*diagnosis Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated/metabolism Humans Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*blood Macular Edema/blood/diagnosis Nephelometry and Turbidimetry Prospective Studies Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I/*blood Risk Assessment Risk Factors Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*blood Young Adult"
23467760,The relationship between delusions and violence: findings from the East London first episode psychosis study.,JAMA Psychiatry,Coid JW and Ullrich S and Kallis C and Keers R and Barker D and Cowden F and Stamps R,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Psychotic persons who are violent often explain their violence as being due to delusions. However, research has failed to confirm associations between delusions and violent behavior. OBJECTIVES: To investigate which delusional beliefs and characteristics are associated with violent behavior during a first episode of psychosis and whether these associations are mediated by affect due to delusions. DESIGN: Population-based epidemiological survey of first-episode psychosis during a 2-year study period. SETTING: Three inner-city boroughs in East London, England. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 458 patients with first-episode psychosis who were 18 to 64 years of age. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were clinically assessed (using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry and the Maudsley Assessment of Delusions Schedule) and interviewed about their displaying violent behavior while experiencing psychotic symptoms during the 12-month period prior to interview. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Violence was classified at 2 levels of severity: minor and serious violence. RESULTS: The prevalence of violence was 38% during the 12-month period, and 12% of the sample engaged in serious violence. Distinct sets of demographic and comorbid risk factors were associated with minor and serious violence. These were adjusted for in subsequent analyses. Anger was the only affect due to delusions that was positively associated with violence. The population-attributable risk percentage was 30.8% for minor violence and 55.9% for serious violence. A small number of uncommon delusional beliefs demonstrated direct pathways leading to minor violence. Three highly prevalent delusions demonstrated pathways to serious violence mediated by anger due to delusional beliefs: persecution (z = 3.09, P = .002), being spied on (z = 3.03, P = .002), and conspiracy (z = 2.98, P = .002). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Anger due to delusions is a key factor that explains the relationship between violence and acute psychosis. A subset of delusional beliefs may be causally linked to violence, and certain uncommon beliefs demonstrated a direct association with minor violence. Highly prevalent delusional beliefs implying threat were associated with serious violence, but they were mediated by anger.","Adolescent Adult Anger/*physiology Delusions/*physiopathology Female Humans Interview, Psychological London Male Middle Aged Psychotic Disorders/*physiopathology *Schizophrenic Psychology Violence/*psychology Young Adult"

Up to 30% of all patients undergoing laparotomy develop an incisional hernia. OBJECTIVE: To compare laparoscopic vs open ventral incisional hernia repair with regard to postoperative pain and nausea, operative results, perioperative and postoperative complications, hospital admission, and recurrence rate. DESIGN: Multicenter randomized controlled trial between May 1999 and December 2006 with a mean follow-up period of 35 months. SETTING: All patients were operated on in a clinical setting at 1 of the 2 participating university medical centers or at the other 8 teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred six patients from 10 hospitals were randomized equally to laparoscopic or open mesh repair. Patients with an incisional hernia larger than 3 cm and smaller than 15 cm, either primary or recurrent, were included. Patients were excluded if they had an open abdomen treatment in their medical histories. INTERVENTION: Laparoscopic or open ventral incisional hernia repair. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of the trial was postoperative pain. Secondary outcomes were use of analgesics, perioperative and postoperative complications, operative time, postoperative nausea, length of hospital stay, recurrence, morbidity, and mortality. RESULTS: Median blood loss during the operation was significantly less (10 mL vs 50 mL; P = .05) as well as the number of patients receiving a wound drain (3% vs. 45%; P < .001) in the laparoscopic group. Operative time for the laparoscopic group was longer (100 minutes vs. 76 minutes; P = .001). Perioperative complications were significantly higher after laparoscopy (9% vs. 2%). Visual analog scale scores for pain and nausea, completed before surgery and 3 days and 1 and 4 weeks postoperatively, showed no significant differences between the 2 groups. At a mean follow-up period of 35 months, a recurrence rate of 14% was reported in the open group and 18%, in the laparoscopic group (P = .30). The size of the defect was found to be an independent predictor for recurrence (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: During the operation, there was less blood loss and less need for a wound drain in the laparoscopic group. However, operative time was longer during laparoscopy. Perioperative complications were significantly higher in the laparoscopic group. Visual analog scores for pain and nausea did not differ between groups. The incidence of a recurrence was similar in both groups. The size of the defect was found to be an independent factor for recurrence of an incisional hernia.","Female Hernia, Ventral/*surgery Herniorrhaphy/*methods Humans *Laparoscopy Male Middle Aged Postoperative Complications/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVES: To inquire about patients' advance care planning activities before hospitalization and preferences for care from the perspectives of patients and family members, as well as to measure real-time concordance between expressed preferences for care and documentation of those preferences in the medical record. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Twelve acute care hospitals in Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Elderly patients who were at high risk of dying in the next 6 months and their family members. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Responses to an in-person administered questionnaire and concordance of expressed preferences and orders of care documented in the medical record. RESULTS: Of 513 patients and 366 family members approached, 278 patients (54.2%) and 225 family members (61.5%) consented to participate. The mean ages of patients and family members were 80.0 and 60.8 years, respectively. Before hospitalization, most patients (76.3%) had thought about end-of-life (EOL) care, and only 11.9% preferred life-prolonging care; 47.9% of patients had completed an advance care plan, and 73.3% had formally named a surrogate decision maker for health care. Of patients who had discussed their wishes, only 30.3% had done so with the family physician and 55.3% with any member of the health care team. Agreement between patients' expressed preferences for EOL care and documentation in the medical record was 30.2%. Family members' perspectives were similar to those of patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Many elderly patients at high risk of dying and their family members have expressed preferences for medical treatments at the EOL. However, communication with health care professionals and documentation of these preferences remains inadequate. Efforts to reduce this significant medical error of omission are warranted.","Adult *Advance Care Planning/trends *Advance Directives Aged Aged, 80 and over Canada *Family Female Humans *Inpatients Male Medical Records/standards Middle Aged *Patient Preference/statistics & numerical data *Patient-Centered Care/trends Prospective Studies Quality of Life Questionnaires *Terminal Care/methods/trends"

Breast cancer in AYA women has a worse prognosis than in older women. Five-year survival rates are lowest for AYA women, and only a few studies have examined the impact of delay in treatment, race/ethnicity, and other socioeconomic factors on survival in AYA women. OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of treatment delay time (TDT), race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, insurance status, cancer stage, and age on the survival from breast cancer among AYA women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a retrospective case-only study of 8860 AYA breast cancer cases diagnosed from 1997 to 2006 using the California Cancer Registry database. EXPOSURE: Treatment delay time was defined as the number of weeks between the date of diagnosis and date of definitive treatment. Kaplan-Meier estimation was used to generate survival curves, and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was performed to assess the association of TDT with survival while accounting for covariates (age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, insurance status, cancer stage [American Joint Committee on Cancer], tumor markers, and treatment). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Five-year survival rates for breast cancer as influenced by host factors, tumor factors, and TDT. RESULTS: Treatment delay time more than 6 weeks after diagnosis was significantly different (P < .001) between racial/ethnic groups (Hispanic, 15.3% and African American, 15.3% compared with non-Hispanic white, 8.1%). Women with public or no insurance (17.8%) compared with those with private insurance (9.5%) and women with low socioeconomic status (17.5%) compared with those with high socioeconomic status (7.7%) were shown to have TDT more than 6 weeks. The 5-year survival in women who were treated by surgery and had TDT more than 6 weeks was 80% compared with 90% (P = .005) in those with TDT less than 2 weeks. In multivariate analysis, longer TDT, estrogen receptor negative status, having public or no insurance, and late cancer stage were significant risk factors for shorter survival. CONCLUSIONS: AND RELEVANCE: Young women with breast cancer with a longer TDT have significantly decreased survival time compared with those with a shorter TDT. This adverse impact on survival was more pronounced in African American women, those with public or no insurance, and those with low SES.",Adolescent Adult African Americans Age Factors Breast Neoplasms/ethnology/*mortality/*surgery Female Hispanic Americans Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Prognosis Proportional Hazards Models Social Class Survival Analysis Young Adult

23817961,Prehospital triage to primary stroke centers and rate of stroke thrombolysis.,JAMA Neurol,Prabhakaran S and O'Neill K and Stein-Spencer L and Walter J and Alberts MJ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Implementation of prehospital stroke triage is a public policy intervention that can have an immediate impact on acute stroke care in a region. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact that a citywide policy recommending prehospital triage of patients with suspected stroke to the nearest primary stroke center had on intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) use in Chicago, Illinois. DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter cohort study from September 1, 2010, to August 31, 2011 (6 months before and after intervention that began March 1, 2011). SETTING: Ten primary stroke center hospitals in Chicago. PATIENTS: All admitted patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack. INTERVENTION Prehospital triage policy of patients with stroke to primary stroke centers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Intravenous tPA use (measured as a fraction of patients with ischemic strokes arriving through the emergency department). RESULTS There were 1075 stroke and transient ischemic attack admissions in the pretriage period and 1172 in the posttriage period. Patient demographic characteristics including age, sex, and risk factors were similar between the 2 periods (mean age, 65 years; 53% female). Compared with the pretriage period, use of emergency medical services increased from 30.2% to 38.1% (P < .001) and emergency medical services prenotification increased from 65.5% to 76.5% (P = .001) after implementation. Rates of intravenous tPA use were 3.8% and 10.1% (P < .001) and onset-to-treatment times decreased from 171.7 to 145.7 minutes (P = .03) in the pretriage and posttriage periods, respectively. Stroke unit admission, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates, and in-hospital mortality were not significantly different between periods. Adjusting for mode of arrival, prehospital notification, and onset-to-arrival time, the posttriage period was independently associated with increased tPA use for patients with ischemic stroke presenting through the emergency department (adjusted odds ratio = 2.21; 95% CI, 1.34-3.64). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Implementation of a prehospital stroke triage policy in Chicago resulted in significant improvements in emergency medical services use and prenotification and more than doubled intravenous tPA use at primary stroke centers.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Chicago Cohort Studies Emergency Service, Hospital Female Fibrinolytic Agents/*therapeutic use Health Services Accessibility Humans Male Middle Aged Retrospective Studies Stroke/*drug therapy/prevention & control Thrombolytic Therapy/methods Tissue Plasminogen Activator/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use *Triage"
23896931,Infant feeding and childhood cognition at ages 3 and 7 years: Effects of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity.,JAMA Pediatr,Belfort MB and Rifas-Shiman SL and Kleinman KP and Guthrie LB and Bellinger DC and Taveras EM and Gillman MW and Oken E,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Breastfeeding may benefit child cognitive development, but few studies have quantified breastfeeding duration or exclusivity, nor has any study to date examined the role of maternal diet during lactation on child cognition. OBJECTIVES: To examine relationships of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity with child cognition at ages 3 and 7 years and to evaluate the extent to which maternal fish intake during lactation modifies associations of infant feeding with later cognition. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study (Project Viva), a US prebirth cohort that enrolled mothers from April 22, 1999, to July 31, 2002, and followed up children to age 7 years, including 1312 Project Viva mothers and children. MAIN EXPOSURE: Duration of any breastfeeding to age 12 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Child receptive language assessed with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test at age 3 years, Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities at ages 3 and 7 years, and Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test and Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning at age 7 years. RESULTS: Adjusting for sociodemographics, maternal intelligence, and home environment in linear regression, longer breastfeeding duration was associated with higher Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test score at age 3 years (0.21; 95% CI, 0.03-0.38 points per month breastfed) and with higher intelligence on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test at age 7 years (0.35; 0.16-0.53 verbal points per month breastfed; and 0.29; 0.05-0.54 nonverbal points per month breastfed). Breastfeeding duration was not associated with Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning scores. Beneficial effects of breastfeeding on the Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities at age 3 years seemed greater for women who consumed 2 or more servings of fish per week (0.24; 0.00-0.47 points per month breastfed) compared with less than 2 servings of fish per week (-0.01; -0.22 to 0.20 points per month breastfed) (P = .16 for interaction).

Many of the negative effects that stem from media exposure may be reduced by parental monitoring of children's media use; however, there lacks a clear understanding of the mechanisms and extent of these protective effects. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prospective effects of parental monitoring of children's media on physical, social, and academic outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort design. Data were collected by in-home and in-school surveys in 2 communities in Iowa and Minnesota, where 1323 third- (n = 430), fourth- (n = 446), and fifth- (n = 423) grade students participated. A primary caregiver and teachers also provided data about the student. INTERVENTIONS: Participants in the current study were recruited to participate in a social ecological model-based obesity prevention program. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Body mass index, average weekly sleep, school performance, prosocial behavior, and aggressive behavior. RESULTS Structural equation modeling revealed that parental monitoring of children's media influences children's sleep, school performance, and prosocial and aggressive behaviors and that these effects are mediated through total screen time and exposure to media violence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Parental monitoring of media has protective effects on a wide variety of academic, social, and physical child outcomes. Pediatricians and physicians are uniquely positioned to provide scientifically based recommendations to families; encouraging parents to monitor children's media carefully can have a wide range of health benefits for children.",Aggression Body Mass Index Computers/*statistics & numerical data Educational Status Female Humans Iowa Male Minnesota *Parenting Prospective Studies *Sleep *Social Behavior Television/*statistics & numerical data Time Factors Video Games/*statistics & numerical data Violence
24804971,Multidimensional frailty score for the prediction of postoperative mortality risk.,JAMA Surg,Kim SW and Han HS and Jung HW and Kim KI and Hwang DW and Kang SB and Kim CH,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The number of geriatric patients who undergo surgery has been increasing, but there are insufficient tools to predict postoperative outcomes in the elderly. OBJECTIVE: To design a predictive model for adverse outcomes in older surgical patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From October 19, 2011, to July 31, 2012, a single tertiary care center enrolled 275 consecutive elderly patients (aged >/=65 years) undergoing intermediate-risk or high-risk elective operations in the Department of Surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the 1-year all-cause mortality rate. The secondary outcomes were postoperative complications (eg, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, delirium, acute pulmonary thromboembolism, and unplanned intensive care unit admission), length of hospital stay, and discharge to nursing facility. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (9.1%) died during the follow-up period (median [interquartile range], 13.3 [11.5-16.1] months), including 4 in-hospital deaths after surgery. Twenty-nine patients (10.5%) experienced at least 1 complication after surgery and 24 (8.7%) were discharged to nursing facilities. Malignant disease and low serum albumin levels were more common in the patients who died. Among the geriatric assessment domains, Charlson Comorbidity Index, dependence in activities of daily living, dependence in instrumental activities of daily living, dementia, risk of delirium, short midarm circumference, and malnutrition were associated with increased mortality rates. A multidimensional frailty score model composed of the above items predicted all-cause mortality rates more accurately than the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.821 vs 0.647; P = .01). The sensitivity and specificity for predicting all-cause mortality rates were 84.0% and 69.2%, respectively, according to the model's cutoff point (>5 vs </=5). High-risk patients (multidimensional frailty score >5) showed increased postoperative mortality risk (hazard ratio, 9.01; 95% CI, 2.15-37.78; P = .003) and longer hospital stays after surgery (median [interquartile range], 9 [5-15] vs 6 [3-9] days; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The multidimensional frailty score based on comprehensive geriatric assessment is more useful than conventional methods for predicting outcomes in geriatric patients undergoing surgery.","Activities of Daily Living Aged Aged, 80 and over Body Composition Comorbidity Delirium/complications Dementia/complications Female *Frail Elderly *Geriatric Assessment Humans Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data Male Nutritional Status Postoperative Complications/*mortality Predictive Value of Tests Republic of Korea/epidemiology Risk Factors Skilled Nursing Facilities/utilization Surgical Procedures, Elective/*mortality"
23797716,Contribution of preventable acute care spending to total spending for high-cost Medicare patients.,JAMA,Joynt KE and Gawande AA and Orav EJ and Jha AK,partners,"IMPORTANCE: A small proportion of patients account for the majority of US health care spending, and understanding patterns of spending among this cohort is critical to reducing health care costs. The degree to which preventable acute care services account for spending among these patients is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To quantify preventable acute care services among high-cost Medicare patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We summed standardized costs for each inpatient and outpatient service contained in standard 5% Medicare files from 2009 and 2010 across the year for each patient in our sample, and defined those in the top decile of spending in 2010 as high-cost patients and those in the top decile in both 2009 and 2010 as persistently high-cost patients. We used standard algorithms to identify potentially preventable emergency department (ED) visits and acute care inpatient hospitalizations. A total of 1,114,469 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years or older were included. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of acute care hospital and ED costs deemed preventable among high-cost patients. RESULTS: The 10% of Medicare patients in the high-cost group were older, more often male, more often black, and had more comorbid illnesses than non-high-cost patients. In 2010, 32.9% (95% CI, 32.9%-32.9%) of total ED costs were incurred by high-cost patients. Based on validated algorithms, 41.0% (95% CI, 40.9%-41.0%) of these costs among high-cost patients were potentially preventable compared with 42.6% (95% CI, 42.6%-42.6%) among non-high-cost patients. High-cost patients accounted for 79.0% (95% CI, 79.0%-79.0%) of inpatient costs, 9.6% (95% CI, 9.6%-9.6%) of which were due to preventable hospitalizations; 16.8% (95% CI, 16.8%-16.8%) of costs within the non-high-cost group were due to preventable hospitalizations. Comparable proportions of ED spending (43.3%; 95% CI, 43.3%-43.3%) and inpatient spending (13.5%; 95% CI, 13.5%-13.5%) were preventable among persistently high-cost patients. Regions with high primary care physician supply had higher preventable spending for high-cost patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among a sample of patients in the top decile of Medicare spending in 2010, only a small percentage of costs appeared to be related to preventable ED visits and hospitalizations. The ability to lower costs for these patients through better outpatient care may be limited.","Acute Disease/therapy Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Algorithms Ambulatory Care/economics/statistics & numerical data *Cost Control Emergency Service, Hospital/*economics/utilization Fee-for-Service Plans/statistics & numerical data Female Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data Health Expenditures/*statistics & numerical data Hospitalization/*economics/statistics & numerical data Humans Male Medicare Primary Health Care/statistics & numerical data Risk Sex Factors United States"
23321763,Effect of not monitoring residual gastric volume on risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults receiving mechanical ventilation and early enteral feeding: a randomized controlled trial.,JAMA,Reignier J and Mercier E and Le Gouge A and Boulain T and Desachy A and Bellec F and Clavel M and Frat JP and Plantefeve G and Quenot JP and Lascarrou JB,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Monitoring of residual gastric volume is recommended to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in patients receiving early enteral nutrition. However, studies have challenged the reliability and effectiveness of this measure. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the risk of VAP is not increased when residual gastric volume is not monitored compared with routine residual gastric volume monitoring in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and early enteral nutrition. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized, noninferiority, open-label, multicenter trial conducted from May 2010 through March 2011 in adults requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 2 days and given enteral nutrition within 36 hours after intubation at 9 French intensive care units (ICUs); 452 patients were randomized and 449 included in the intention-to-treat analysis (3 withdrew initial consent). INTERVENTION: Absence of residual gastric volume monitoring. Intolerance to enteral nutrition was based only on regurgitation and vomiting in the intervention group and based on residual gastric volume greater than 250 mL at any of the 6 hourly measurements and regurgitation or vomiting in the control group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of patients with at least 1 VAP episode within 90 days after randomization, as assessed by an adjudication committee blinded to patient group. The prestated noninferiority margin was 10%. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat population, VAP occurred in 38 of 227 patients (16.7%) in the intervention group and in 35 of 222 patients (15.8%) in the control group (difference, 0.9%; 90% CI, -4.8% to 6.7%). There were no significant between-group differences in other ICU-acquired infections, mechanical ventilation duration, ICU stay length, or mortality rates. The proportion of patients receiving 100% of their calorie goal was higher in the intervention group (odds ratio, 1.77; 90% CI, 1.25-2.51; P = .008). Similar results were obtained in the per-protocol population.

Reports indicate that this has expanded health coverage. Objective: To evaluate coverage, access to care, and health care use among 19- to 25-year-olds compared with 26- to 34-year-olds following PPACA implementation. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data from the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System and the National Health Interview Survey, which provide nationally representative measures of coverage, access to care, and health care use, were used to conduct the study among participants aged 19 to 25 years (young adults) and 26 to 34 years (adults) in 2009 and 2012. Exposure: Self-reported health insurance coverage. Main Outcomes and Measures: Health status, presence of a usual source of care, and ability to afford medications, dental care, or physician visits. Results: Health coverage increased between 2009 and 2012 for 19- to 25-year-olds (68.3% to 71.7%). Using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, after adjustment, the likelihood of having a usual source of care decreased in both groups but more significantly for 26- to 34-year-olds (DID, 2.8%; 95% CI, 0.45 to 5.15). There was no significant change in health status for 19- to 25-year-olds compared with 26- to 34-year-olds (DID, -0.5%; 95% CI, -1.87 to 0.87). There was no significant change for 19- to 25-year-olds compared with 26- to 34-year-olds in the percentage who reported receiving a routine checkup in the past year (DID, 0.3%; 95% CI, -2.25 to 2.85) or in the ability to afford prescription medications (DID, -0.4%; 95% CI, -2.93 to 1.93), dental care (DID, -2.6%; 95% CI, -5.61 to 0.61), or physician visits (DID, -1.7%; 95% CI, -3.66 to 0.26). There was also no change in the percentage who reported receiving a flu shot (DID, 1.9; 95% CI, -1.93 to 4.93). Insured individuals were more likely to report having a usual source of care and a recent routine checkup and were more likely to be able to afford health care than uninsured individuals. Conclusions and Relevance: Implementation of the PPACA was associated with increased health insurance coverage for 19- to 25-year-olds without significant changes in perceived health care affordability or health status. Although the likelihood of having a usual source of care declined between 2009 and 2012 for all, this decrease was smaller among 19- to 25-year-olds, and younger adults were more likely than 26- to 34-year-olds to have a usual source of care.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: To assess primary care appointment availability by state and insurance status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a simulated patient study. Trained field staff, randomly assigned to private insurance, Medicaid, or uninsured, called primary care offices requesting the first available appointment for either routine care or an urgent health concern. The study included a stratified random sample of primary care practices treating nonelderly adults within each of 10 states (Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Texas), selected for diversity along numerous dimensions. Collectively, these states comprise almost one-third of the US nonelderly, Medicaid, and currently uninsured populations. Sampling was based on enrollment by insurance type by county. Analyses were weighted to obtain population-based estimates for each state. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The ability to schedule an appointment and number of days to the appointment. We also examined cost and payment required at the visit for the uninsured. RESULTS: Between November 13, 2012, and April 4, 2013, we made 12,907 calls to 7788 primary care practices requesting new patient appointments. Across the 10 states, 84.7% (95% CI, 82.6%-86.8%) of privately insured and 57.9% (95% CI, 54.8%-61.0%) of Medicaid callers received an appointment. Appointment rates were 78.8% (95% CI, 75.6%-82.0%) for uninsured patients with full cash payment but only 15.4% (95% CI, 13.2%-17.6%) if payment required at the time of the visit was restricted to $75 or less. Conditional on getting an appointment, median wait times were typically less than 1 week (2 weeks in Massachusetts), with no differences by insurance status or urgency of health concern. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although most primary care physicians are accepting new patients, access varies widely across states and insurance status. Navigator programs are needed, not only to help patients enroll but also to identify practices accepting new patients within each plan's network. Tracking new patient appointment availability over time can inform policies designed to strengthen primary care capacity and enhance the effectiveness of the coverage expansions with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.",Adult Appointments and Schedules Health Care Reform Health Services Accessibility/*statistics & numerical data Humans *Insurance Coverage *Patient Simulation Primary Health Care/*statistics & numerical data
24327038,Proton pump inhibitor and histamine 2 receptor antagonist use and vitamin B12 deficiency.,JAMA,Lam JR and Schneider JL and Zhao W and Corley DA,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) suppress the production of gastric acid and thus may lead to malabsorption of vitamin B12. However, few data exist regarding the associations between long-term exposure to these medications and vitamin B12 deficiency in large population-based studies. OBJECTIVE: To study the association between use of PPIs and H2RAs and vitamin B12 deficiency in a community-based setting in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We evaluated the association between vitamin B12 deficiency and prior use of acid-suppressing medication using a case-control study within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California population. We compared 25,956 patients having incident diagnoses of vitamin B12 deficiency between January 1997 and June 2011 with 184,199 patients without B12 deficiency. Exposures and outcomes were ascertained via electronic pharmacy, laboratory, and diagnostic databases. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk of vitamin B12 deficiency was estimated using odds ratios (ORs) from conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Among patients with incident diagnoses of vitamin B12 deficiency, 3120 (12.0%) were dispensed a 2 or more years' supply of PPIs, 1087 (4.2%) were dispensed a 2 or more years' supply of H2RAs (without any PPI use), and 21,749 (83.8%) had not received prescriptions for either PPIs or H2RAs. Among patients without vitamin B12 deficiency, 13,210 (7.2%) were dispensed a 2 or more years' supply of PPIs, 5897 (3.2%) were dispensed a 2 or more years' supply of H2RAs (without any PPI use), and 165,092 (89.6%) had not received prescriptions for either PPIs or H2RAs. Both a 2 or more years' supply of PPIs (OR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.58-1.73]) and a 2 or more years' supply of H2RAs (OR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.17-1.34]) were associated with an increased risk for vitamin B12 deficiency. Doses more than 1.5 PPI pills/d were more strongly associated with vitamin B12 deficiency (OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.77-2.15]) than were doses less than 0.75 pills/d (OR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.48-1.78]; P = .007 for interaction). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Previous and current gastric acid inhibitor use was significantly associated with the presence of vitamin B12 deficiency.

24026523,Cognitive-behavioral therapy vs risperidone for augmenting serotonin reuptake inhibitors in obsessive-compulsive disorder: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA Psychiatry,Simpson HB and Foa EB and Liebowitz MR and Huppert JD and Cahill S and Maher MJ and McLean CP and Bender J Jr and Marcus SM and Williams MT and Weaver J and Vermes D and Van Meter PE and Rodriguez CI and Powers M and Pinto A and Imms P and Hahn CG and Campeas R,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the world's most disabling illnesses according to the World Health Organization. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the only medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat OCD, but few patients achieve minimal symptoms from an SRI alone. In such cases, practice guidelines recommend adding antipsychotics or cognitive-behavioral therapy consisting of exposure and ritual prevention (EX/RP). OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of these 2 SRI augmentation strategies vs pill placebo for the first time, to our knowledge, in adults with OCD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial (conducted January 2007-August 2012) at 2 academic outpatient research clinics that specialize in OCD and anxiety disorders. Patients (aged 18-70 years) were eligible if they had OCD of at least moderate severity despite a therapeutic SRI dose for at least 12 weeks prior to entry. Of 163 who were eligible, 100 were randomized (risperidone, n = 40; EX/RP, n = 40; and placebo, n = 20), and 86 completed the trial. INTERVENTIONS: While continuing their SRI at the same dose, patients were randomized to the addition of 8 weeks of risperidone (up to 4 mg/d), EX/RP (17 sessions delivered twice weekly), or pill placebo. Independent assessments were conducted every 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) to measure OCD severity. RESULTS: Patients randomized to EX/RP had significantly greater reduction in week 8 Y-BOCS scores based on mixed-effects models (vs risperidone: mean [SE], -9.72 [1.38]; P < .001 vs placebo: mean [SE], -10.10 [1.68]; P < .001). Patients receiving risperidone did not significantly differ from those receiving placebo (mean [SE], -0.38 [1.72]; P = .83). More patients receiving EX/RP responded (Y-BOCS score decrease >/=25%: 80% for EX/RP, 23% for risperidone, and 15% for placebo; P < .001). More patients receiving EX/RP achieved minimal symptoms (Y-BOCS score </=12: 43% for EX/RP, 13% for risperidone, and 5% for placebo; P = .001). Adding EX/RP was also superior to risperidone and placebo in improving insight, functioning, and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adding EX/RP to SRIs was superior to both risperidone and pill placebo. Patients with OCD receiving SRIs who continue to have clinically significant symptoms should be offered EX/RP before antipsychotics given its superior efficacy and less negative adverse effect profile.

23644932,Lutein + zeaxanthin and omega-3 fatty acids for age-related macular degeneration: the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Missing,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Oral supplementation with the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) formulation (antioxidant vitamins C and E, beta carotene, and zinc) has been shown to reduce the risk of progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Observational data suggest that increased dietary intake of lutein + zeaxanthin (carotenoids), omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] + eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]), or both might further reduce this risk. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether adding lutein + zeaxanthin, DHA + EPA, or both to the AREDS formulation decreases the risk of developing advanced AMD and to evaluate the effect of eliminating beta carotene, lowering zinc doses, or both in the AREDS formulation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2), a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled phase 3 study with a 2 x 2 factorial design, conducted in 2006-2012 and enrolling 4203 participants aged 50 to 85 years at risk for progression to advanced AMD with bilateral large drusen or large drusen in 1 eye and advanced AMD in the fellow eye. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive lutein (10 mg) + zeaxanthin (2 mg), DHA (350 mg) + EPA (650 mg), lutein + zeaxanthin and DHA + EPA, or placebo. All participants were also asked to take the original AREDS formulation or accept a secondary randomization to 4 variations of the AREDS formulation, including elimination of beta carotene, lowering of zinc dose, or both. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Development of advanced AMD. The unit of analyses used was by eye. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 5 years, with 1940 study eyes (1608 participants) progressing to advanced AMD. Kaplan-Meier probabilities of progression to advanced AMD by 5 years were 31% (493 eyes [406 participants]) for placebo, 29% (468 eyes [399 participants]) for lutein + zeaxanthin, 31% (507 eyes [416 participants]) for DHA + EPA, and 30% (472 eyes [387 participants]) for lutein + zeaxanthin and DHA + EPA. Comparison with placebo in the primary analyses demonstrated no statistically significant reduction in progression to advanced AMD (hazard ratio [HR], 0.90 [98.7% CI, 0.76-1.07]; P = .12 for lutein + zeaxanthin; 0.97 [98.7% CI, 0.82-1.16]; P = .70 for DHA + EPA; 0.89 [98.7% CI, 0.75-1.06]; P = .10 for lutein + zeaxanthin and DHA + EPA). There was no apparent effect of beta carotene elimination or lower-dose zinc on progression to advanced AMD. More lung cancers were noted in the beta carotene vs no beta carotene group (23 [2.0%] vs 11 [0.9%], nominal P = .04), mostly in former smokers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Addition of lutein + zeaxanthin, DHA + EPA, or both to the AREDS formulation in primary analyses did not further reduce risk of progression to advanced AMD. However, because of potential increased incidence of lung cancer in former smokers, lutein + zeaxanthin could be an appropriate carotenoid substitute in the AREDS formulation.

25058084,Breast cancer screening using tomosynthesis in combination with digital mammography.,JAMA,Friedewald SM and Rafferty EA and Rose SL and Durand MA and Plecha DM and Greenberg JS and Hayes MK and Copit DS and Carlson KL and Cink TM and Barke LD and Greer LN and Miller DP and Conant EF,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Mammography plays a key role in early breast cancer detection. Single-institution studies have shown that adding tomosynthesis to mammography increases cancer detection and reduces false-positive results. OBJECTIVE: To determine if mammography combined with tomosynthesis is associated with better performance of breast screening programs in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis of screening performance metrics from 13 academic and nonacademic breast centers using mixed models adjusting for site as a random effect. EXPOSURES: Period 1: digital mammography screening examinations 1 year before tomosynthesis implementation (start dates ranged from March 2010 to October 2011 through the date of tomosynthesis implementation); period 2: digital mammography plus tomosynthesis examinations from initiation of tomosynthesis screening (March 2011 to October 2012) through December 31, 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Recall rate for additional imaging, cancer detection rate, and positive predictive values for recall and for biopsy. RESULTS: A total of 454,850 examinations (n=281,187 digital mammography; n=173,663 digital mammography + tomosynthesis) were evaluated. With digital mammography, 29,726 patients were recalled and 5056 biopsies resulted in cancer diagnosis in 1207 patients (n=815 invasive; n=392 in situ). With digital mammography + tomosynthesis, 15,541 patients were recalled and 3285 biopsies resulted in cancer diagnosis in 950 patients (n=707 invasive; n=243 in situ). Model-adjusted rates per 1000 screens were as follows: for recall rate, 107 (95% CI, 89-124) with digital mammography vs 91 (95% CI, 73-108) with digital mammography + tomosynthesis; difference, -16 (95% CI, -18 to -14; P < .001); for biopsies, 18.1 (95% CI, 15.4-20.8) with digital mammography vs 19.3 (95% CI, 16.6-22.1) with digital mammography + tomosynthesis; difference, 1.3 (95% CI, 0.4-2.1; P = .004); for cancer detection, 4.2 (95% CI, 3.8-4.7) with digital mammography vs 5.4 (95% CI, 4.9-6.0) with digital mammography + tomosynthesis; difference, 1.2 (95% CI, 0.8-1.6; P < .001); and for invasive cancer detection, 2.9 (95% CI, 2.5-3.2) with digital mammography vs 4.1 (95% CI, 3.7-4.5) with digital mammography + tomosynthesis; difference, 1.2 (95% CI, 0.8-1.6; P < .001). The in situ cancer detection rate was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2-1.6) per 1000 screens with both methods. Adding tomosynthesis was associated with an increase in the positive predictive value for recall from 4.3% to 6.4% (difference, 2.1%; 95% CI, 1.7%-2.5%; P < .001) and for biopsy from 24.2% to 29.2% (difference, 5.0%; 95% CI, 3.0%-7.0%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Addition of tomosynthesis to digital mammography was associated with a decrease in recall rate and an increase in cancer detection rate.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, when added to standard therapy, would reduce the rate of cardiovascular (CV) death or HF rehospitalization among HHF patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: International, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that randomized hemodynamically stable HHF patients a median 5 days after admission. Eligible patients were 18 years or older with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40% or less, elevated natriuretic peptides (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] >/= 400 pg/mL or N -terminal pro-BNP [NT-proBNP] >/= 1600 pg/mL), and signs and symptoms of fluid overload. Patients were recruited from 316 sites across North and South America, Europe, and Asia between May 2009 and December 2011. The follow-up period ended in July 2012. INTERVENTION: All patients received 150 mg (increased to 300 mg as tolerated) of aliskiren or placebo daily, in addition to standard therapy. The study drug was continued after discharge for a median 11.3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Cardiovascular death or HF rehospitalization at 6 months and 12 months. RESULTS: In total, 1639 patients were randomized, with 1615 patients included in the final efficacy analysis cohort (808 aliskiren, 807 placebo). Mean age was 65 years; mean LVEF, 28%; 41% of patients had diabetes mellitus, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate, 67 mL/min/1.73 m2. At admission and randomization, median NT-proBNP levels were 4239 pg/mL and 2718 pg/mL, respectively. At randomization, patients were receiving diuretics (95.9%), beta-blockers (82.5%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (84.2%), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (57.0%). In total, 24.9% of patients receiving aliskiren (77 CV deaths, 153 HF rehospitalizations) and 26.5% of patients receiving placebo (85 CV deaths, 166 HF rehospitalizations) experienced the primary end point at 6 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.76-1.12; P = .41). At 12 months, the event rates were 35.0% for the aliskiren group (126 CV deaths, 212 HF rehospitalizations) and 37.3% for the placebo group (137 CV deaths, 224 HF rehospitalizations; HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.79-1.09; P = .36). The rates of hyperkalemia, hypotension, and renal impairment/renal failure were higher in the aliskiren group compared with placebo. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients hospitalized for HF with reduced LVEF, initiation of aliskiren in addition to standard therapy did not reduce CV death or HF rehospitalization at 6 months or 12 months after discharge.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether RBC transfusion thresholds are associated with the risk of infection and whether risk is independent of leukocyte reduction. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Sytematic Reviews, ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry, and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number register were searched through January 22, 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials with restrictive vs liberal RBC transfusion strategies. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Twenty-one randomized trials with 8735 patients met eligibility criteria, of which 18 trials (n = 7593 patients) contained sufficient information for meta-analyses. DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models were used to report pooled risk ratios. Absolute risks of infection were calculated using the profile likelihood random-effects method. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of health care-associated infection such as pneumonia, mediastinitis, wound infection, and sepsis. RESULTS: The pooled risk of all serious infections was 11.8% (95% CI, 7.0%-16.7%) in the restrictive group and 16.9% (95% CI, 8.9%-25.4%) in the liberal group. The risk ratio (RR) for the association between transfusion strategies and serious infection was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.72-0.95) with little heterogeneity (I2 = 0%; tau2 <.0001). The number needed to treat (NNT) with restrictive strategies to prevent serious infection was 38 (95% CI, 24-122). The risk of infection remained reduced with a restrictive strategy, even with leukocyte reduction (RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67-0.95]). For trials with a restrictive hemoglobin threshold of <7.0 g/dL, the RR was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.70-0.97) with NNT of 20 (95% CI, 12-133). With stratification by patient type, the RR was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.54-0.91) in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.28-0.95) in patients presenting with sepsis. There were no significant differences in the incidence of infection by RBC threshold for patients with cardiac disease, the critically ill, those with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or for infants with low birth weight. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among hospitalized patients, a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy was associated with a reduced risk of health care-associated infection compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. Implementing restrictive strategies may have the potential to lower the incidence of health care-associated infection.",Cross Infection/*epidemiology *Erythrocyte Transfusion Humans Mediastinitis/epidemiology Pneumonia/epidemiology Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Risk Sepsis/epidemiology Surgical Wound Infection/epidemiology
24190655,"Prospective associations of concerns about physique and the development of obesity, binge drinking, and drug use among adolescent boys and young adult men.",JAMA Pediatr,Field AE and Sonneville KR and Crosby RD and Swanson SA and Eddy KT and Camargo CA Jr and Horton NJ and Micali N,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Relatively little is known about the prevalence of concerns with physique and eating disorders among males and their relation to subsequent adverse outcomes. A broader range of eating disorders needs to be defined to diagnose these illnesses appropriately in males. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether males with psychiatric symptoms related to disordered eating and concern about physique are more likely to become obese, to start using drugs, to consume alcohol frequently (binge drinking), or to develop high levels of depressive symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The data come from questionnaires sent every 12 to 36 months from 1999 through 2010 to youth in a prospective cohort study, the Growing Up Today Study. The analysis included 5527 males aged 12 to 18 years in 1999 from across the United States who responded to the Growing Up Today Study questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Development of obesity and high levels of depressive symptoms and initiation of drug use and binge drinking at least monthly. RESULTS: From 1999 through 2011 in at least 1 study year, 9.2% of respondents reported high concerns with muscularity but no bulimic behaviors; 2.4%, high concerns with muscularity and use of supplements, growth hormone derivatives, or anabolic steroids to achieve their desired physique; 2.5%, high concerns with thinness but no bulimic behaviors; and 6.3%, high concerns with thinness and muscularity. For eating disorders, 0.8% had partial- or full-criteria bulimia nervosa or purging disorder and 2.9% had partial or full-criteria binge eating disorder but no association with the outcomes of interest. Infrequent binge eating or purging or overeating without a loss of control were reported by 31.0%. However, independent of age and body mass index, males with high concerns about thinness but not muscularity were more likely to develop high depressive symptoms (odds ratio, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.36-5.44). Males with high concerns about muscularity and thinness were more likely than their peers to use drugs (odds ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.31-3.46), and males with high concerns about muscularity who used supplements and other products to enhance physique were more likely to start binge drinking frequently (2.06; 1.58-2.69) and using drugs (2.16; 1.49-3.11). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: High concerns with muscularity are relatively common among adolescent boys and young men. Males with these concerns who use potentially unhealthy products to improve their physique are at increased risk of adverse outcomes but may not be recognized by their health care providers as having a weight-related disorder because of the sex-specific presentation.",Adolescent Adolescent Behavior/*psychology Binge Drinking/*psychology Body Image/*psychology Child Cohort Studies Eating Disorders/psychology Humans Male Obesity/*psychology Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Substance-Related Disorders/*psychology Young Adult
24912011,Bullying and weapon carrying: a meta-analysis.,JAMA Pediatr,van Geel M and Vedder P and Tanilon J,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Studies suggest that adolescents involved in bullying are more likely to carry weapons than their uninvolved peers. OBJECTIVE: To use meta-analyses to determine whether victims, bullies, and bully-victims are more likely to carry weapons than uninvolved peers. DATA SOURCES: PsycINFO, ERIC, MEDLINE, LILACS, EMBASE, and Dissertation Abstracts International were searched for relevant publications (1950 through January 2014). The reference list of a review article and reference lists of retrieved articles were checked for further relevant studies. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they provided an effect size comparing the weapon carrying of adolescent victims, bullies, or bully-victims with that of uninvolved peers. Studies that included individuals older than 21 years were excluded, as were studies that focused on incarcerated youth or youth diagnosed as having a psychopathologic condition. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Studies were coded independently by 2 of us. The agreement rate was 93%. Effect sizes were coded that compared victims, bullies, or bully-victims with uninvolved peers. Meta-analyses were based on 22 studies for victims (n = 257 179), 15 studies for bullies (n = 236 145), and 8 studies for bully-victims (n = 199 563). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This study focused on weapon carrying among adolescents. Hypotheses were formulated before the study. RESULTS: Victims (odds ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.62-2.39), bullies (3.25; 2.72-3.89), and bully-victims (4.95; 3.77-6.50) were more likely to carry weapons than uninvolved peers. Analyses provided no indication of publication bias. Studies conducted in the United States found stronger relations between being a bully-victim and weapon carrying (odds ratio, 7.84; 95% CI, 6.02-10.21) than studies from other countries (3.62; 2.30-5.68; Q1 = 8.401; P = .004).

23896628,Age-related kidney transplant outcomes: health disparities amplified in adolescence.,JAMA Intern Med,Andreoni KA and Forbes R and Andreoni RM and Phillips G and Stewart H and Ferris M,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The transition from pediatric to adult health care is a vulnerable time for patients with chronic conditions. We need to better understand the factors affecting the health of kidney transplant recipients during this transition. OBJECTIVE: To determine the age at which renal transplant recipients are at greatest risk for graft loss. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 168,809 first kidney-only transplant events from October 1987 through October 2010, in recipients up to age 55 years as reported by the Organ Procurement Transplantation Network Standard Transplant Analysis and Research Database. Recipient age at transplant was the primary predictor studied. Confounder and effect modifier covariates were identified and studied using Cox proportional hazard models. EXPOSURE: Kidney-only transplant. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient and renal graft survival, along with death-censored and non-death-censored information. RESULTS: A total of 168,809 renal transplant events met the inclusion criteria. Recipients who received their first kidney transplant at age 14 to 16 years were at the highest risk of graft loss, with inferior outcomes starting at 1 and amplifying at 3, 5, and 10 years after transplant. Black adolescents were at disproportionately high risk of graft failure. The variables that had significant interaction with recipient age were donor type (deceased vs living) and insurance type (government vs private). Among 14-year-old recipients, the risk of death was 175% greater in the deceased donor-government insurance group vs the living donor-private insurance group (hazard ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.90-0.94] vs 0.34 [95% CI, 0.33-0.36]), whereas patient survival rates in the living donor-government insurance and deceased donor-private insurance groups were nearly identical (hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.58-0.63] vs 0.54 [95% CI, 0.51-0.56]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Recipients aged 14 to 16 years have the greatest risk of kidney allograft failure. Black adolescents and those with government insurance are at even higher risk. Private insurance reduces risk of death across all ages. Comprehensive programs are needed for adolescents, especially for those at greater risk, to reduce graft loss during the transition from adolescence to adulthood.","Adolescent Adult African Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Age Factors Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Female Graft Rejection/*epidemiology Graft Survival HLA Antigens/immunology Histocompatibility Testing Humans Hypertension/epidemiology Insurance, Health/statistics & numerical data Kaplan-Meier Estimate Kidney Transplantation/mortality/*statistics & numerical data Male Middle Aged Proportional Hazards Models Retrospective Studies Sex Factors Tissue Donors/statistics & numerical data United States/epidemiology"

The safety of this procedure in adults is based on small case series. To our knowledge, we report the first population-level analysis of the safety of adult tonsillectomies in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the mortality, complication, and reoperation rate in adult tonsillectomy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of 5968 adult patients who underwent tonsillectomy with records in the database of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (2005 to 2011). INTERVENTION: Tonsillectomy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes of interest included mortality, complications, and reoperation in the 30-day postoperative period. Statistical analysis included chi(2) test, t test, and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality rate was 0.03%, the complication rate was 1.2%, and the reoperation rate was 3.2%. Most patients had a primary diagnosis of chronic tonsillitis and/or adenoiditis (82.9%), and the most common complications were pneumonia (27% of all complications), urinary tract infection (27%), and superficial site infections (16%). Patients who underwent reoperation were more likely to be male (54.0% vs 32.4%; P < .001), white (84.8% vs 75.3%; P = .02), or inpatients (24.3% vs 14.3%; P < .001) and to have postoperative complications (5.3% vs 1.1%; P < .001) than those who did not return to the operating room. On multivariate analysis, male sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.30 [95% CI, 1.67-3.15]), inpatient status (OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.04-2.22]), and the presence of a postoperative complication (OR, 4.58 [95% CI, 2.11-9.93]) were independent risk factors for reoperation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the United States, adult tonsillectomy is a safe procedure with low rates of mortality and morbidity. The most common posttonsillectomy complications were infectious in etiology, and complications were independently associated with the need for reoperation.","Adult Databases, Factual Female Humans Incidence Male Population Surveillance/*methods Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology *Quality Improvement Reoperation/statistics & numerical data Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment/*methods Survival Rate/trends *Tonsillectomy United States/epidemiology"

Moreover, expected mortality not related to first-ever stroke is not taken in account. OBJECTIVES To investigate long-term mortality and cause of death after acute stroke in adults aged 18 through 50 years and to compare this with nationwide age- and sex-matched mortality rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Follow -Up of Transient Ischemic Attack and Stroke Patients and Unelucidated Risk Factor Evaluation (FUTURE) study, a prospective cohort study of prognosis after transient ischemic attack (TIA), ischemic stroke, or hemorrhagic stroke in adults aged 18 through 50 years admitted to Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, the Netherlands, between January 1, 1980, and November 1, 2010. The survival status of 959 consecutive patients with a first-ever TIA (n = 262), ischemic stroke (n = 606), or intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 91) was assessed as of November 1, 2012. Mean follow-up duration was 11.1 (SD, 8.7) years (median, 8.3 [interquartile range, 4.0-17.4]). Observed mortality was compared with the expected mortality, derived from mortality rates in the general population with similar age, sex, and calendar-year characteristics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative 20-year mortality among 30-day survivors of stroke. RESULTS: At the end of follow-up, 192 patients (20.0%) had died. Among 30-day survivors, cumulative 20-year risk of death was 24.9% (95% CI, 16.0%-33.7%) for TIA, 26.8% (95% CI, 21.9%-31.8%) for ischemic stroke, and 13.7% (95% CI, 3.6%-23.9%) for intracerebral hemorrhage. Observed mortality was increased compared with expected mortality (standardized mortality ratio [SMR], 2.6 [95% CI, 1.8-3.7] for TIA, 3.9 [95% CI, 3.2-4.7] for ischemic stroke, and 3.9 [95% CI, 1.9-7.2 for intracerebral hemorrhage, respectively). For ischemic stroke, cumulative 20-year mortality among 30-day survivors was higher in men than in women (33.7% [95% CI, 26.1%-41.3%] vs 19.8% [95% CI, 13.8%-25.9%]). The SMR was 4.3 (95% CI, 3.2-5.6) for women and 3.6 (95% CI, 2.8-4.6) for men. For all etiologic subtypes of ischemic stroke, observed mortality exceeded expected mortality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults aged 18 through 50 years, 20-year mortality following acute stroke was relatively high compared with expected mortality. These findings may warrant further research evaluating secondary prevention strategies in these patients.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors Brain Ischemia/*mortality Cerebral Hemorrhage/*mortality Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Ischemic Attack, Transient/mortality Male Middle Aged Mortality/trends Netherlands/epidemiology Risk Risk Factors Stroke/*mortality Young Adult"
24399556,Trends in smoking among adults with mental illness and association between mental health treatment and smoking cessation.,JAMA,Cook BL and Wayne GF and Kafali EN and Liu Z and Shu C and Flores M,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Significant progress has been made in reducing the prevalence of tobacco use in the United States. However, tobacco cessation efforts have focused on the general population rather than individuals with mental illness, who demonstrate greater rates of tobacco use and nicotine dependence. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether declines in tobacco use have been realized among individuals with mental illness and examine the association between mental health treatment and smoking cessation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Use of nationally representative surveys of noninstitutionalized US residents to compare trends in smoking rates between adults with and without mental illness and across multiple disorders (2004-2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey [MEPS]) and to compare rates of smoking cessation among adults with mental illness who did and did not receive mental health treatment (2009-2011 National Survey of Drug Use and Health [NSDUH]).The MEPS sample included 32,156 respondents with mental illness (operationalized as reporting severe psychological distress, probable depression, or receiving treatment for mental illness) and 133,113 without mental illness. The NSDUH sample included 14,057 lifetime smokers with mental illness. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Current smoking status (primary analysis; MEPS sample) and smoking cessation, operationalized as a lifetime smoker who did not smoke in the last 30 days (secondary analysis; NSDUH sample). RESULTS: Adjusted smoking rates declined significantly among individuals without mental illness (19.2% [95% CI, 18.7-19.7%] to 16.5% [95% CI, 16.0%-17.0%]; P < .001) but changed only slightly among those with mental illness (25.3% [95% CI, 24.2%-26.3%] to 24.9% [95% CI, 23.8%- 26.0%]; P = .50), a significant difference in difference of 2.3% (95% CI, 0.7%-3.9%) (P = .005). Individuals with mental illness who received mental health treatment within the previous year were more likely to have quit smoking (37.2% [95% CI, 35.1%-39.4%]) than those not receiving treatment (33.1% [95% CI, 31.5%-34.7%]) (P = .005). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Between 2004 and 2011, the decline in smoking among individuals with mental illness was significantly less than among those without mental illness, although quit rates were greater among those receiving mental health treatment. This suggests that tobacco control policies and cessation interventions targeting the general population have not worked as effectively for persons with mental illness.","Adolescent Adult Aged Female Health Surveys Humans Male Mental Disorders/*complications/therapy *Mental Health Middle Aged Prevalence Smoking/epidemiology/psychology/*therapy Smoking Cessation/psychology/*statistics & numerical data *Social Control, Formal Tobacco Use Disorder/complications/epidemiology/psychology/*therapy United States/epidemiology Young Adult"
23321764,Association of prehospital advanced airway management with neurologic outcome and survival in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.,JAMA,Hasegawa K and Hiraide A and Chang Y and Brown DF,partners,"IMPORTANCE: It is unclear whether advanced airway management such as endotracheal intubation or use of supraglottic airway devices in the prehospital setting improves outcomes following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) compared with conventional bag-valve-mask ventilation. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that prehospital advanced airway management is associated with favorable outcome after adult OHCA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective, nationwide, population-based study (All-Japan Utstein Registry) involving 649,654 consecutive adult patients in Japan who had an OHCA and in whom resuscitation was attempted by emergency responders with subsequent transport to medical institutions from January 2005 through December 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Favorable neurological outcome 1 month after an OHCA, defined as cerebral performance category 1 or 2. RESULTS: Of the eligible 649,359 patients with OHCA, 367,837 (57%) underwent bag-valve-mask ventilation and 281,522 (43%) advanced airway management, including 41,972 (6%) with endotracheal intubation and 239,550 (37%) with use of supraglottic airways. In the full cohort, the advanced airway group incurred a lower rate of favorable neurological outcome compared with the bag-valve-mask group (1.1% vs 2.9%; odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.36-0.39). In multivariable logistic regression, advanced airway management had an OR for favorable neurological outcome of 0.38 (95% CI, 0.37-0.40) after adjusting for age, sex, etiology of arrest, first documented rhythm, witnessed status, type of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, use of public access automated external defibrillator, epinephrine administration, and time intervals. Similarly, the odds of neurologically favorable survival were significantly lower both for endotracheal intubation (adjusted OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.37-0.45) and for supraglottic airways (adjusted OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.36-0.40). In a propensity score-matched cohort (357,228 patients), the adjusted odds of neurologically favorable survival were significantly lower both for endotracheal intubation (adjusted OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.37-0.55) and for use of supraglottic airways (adjusted OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.33-0.39). Both endotracheal intubation and use of supraglottic airways were similarly associated with decreased odds of neurologically favorable survival. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among adult patients with OHCA, any type of advanced airway management was independently associated with decreased odds of neurologically favorable survival compared with conventional bag-valve-mask ventilation.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Airway Management/*methods Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Cognition Disorders/etiology Emergency Medical Services Emergency Medicine Female *Glasgow Outcome Scale Humans Intubation, Intratracheal/methods Japan Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Nervous System Diseases/etiology Odds Ratio Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/*complications/*mortality/therapy Prospective Studies Registries Treatment Outcome"
23553111,Autism risk across generations: a population-based study of advancing grandpaternal and paternal age.,JAMA Psychiatry,Frans EM and Sandin S and Reichenberg A and Langstrom N and Lichtenstein P and McGrath JJ and Hultman CM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Advancing paternal age has been linked to autism. OBJECTIVE: To further expand knowledge about the association between paternal age and autism by studying the effect of grandfathers' age on childhood autism. DESIGN: Population-based, multigenerational, case-control study. SETTING: Nationwide multigeneration and patient registers in Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a study of individuals born in Sweden since 1932. Parental age at birth was obtained for more than 90% of the cohort. Grandparental age at the time of birth of the parent was obtained for a smaller subset (5936 cases and 30 923 controls). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: International Classification of Diseases diagnosis of childhood autism in the patient registry. RESULTS: A statistically significant monotonic association was found between advancing grandpaternal age at the time of birth of the parent and risk of autism in grandchildren. Men who had fathered a daughter when they were 50 years or older were 1.79 times (95% CI, 1.35-2.37; P < .001) more likely to have a grandchild with autism, and men who had fathered a son when they were 50 years or older were 1.67 times (95% CI, 1.35-2.37; P < .001) more likely to have a grandchild with autism, compared with men who had fathered children when they were 20 to 24 years old, after controlling for birth year and sex of the child, age of the spouse, family history of psychiatric disorders, highest family educational level, and residential county. A statistically significant monotonic association was also found between advancing paternal age and risk of autism in the offspring. Sensitivity analyses indicated that these findings were not the result of bias due to missing data on grandparental age. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Advanced grandparental age was associated with increased risk of autism, suggesting that risk of autism could develop over generations. The results are consistent with mutations and/or epigenetic alterations associated with advancing paternal age.",Adolescent Adult Age Factors Aged Autistic Disorder/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics Case-Control Studies Child Cohort Studies Female Humans Male *Maternal Age Middle Aged *Paternal Age Registries Risk Sweden/epidemiology Young Adult

OBJECTIVE: To identify characteristics of melanoma and its management in the elderly compared with younger patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective population-based study of incident cases of primary melanoma in 1621 patients with stage I or II melanoma in 2004 and 2008. Questionnaires administered to physicians and a survey of cancer registries and pathology laboratories were used to obtain data. The study was conducted in 5 regions in northeastern France. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Characteristics of patients and tumors, circumstances of diagnosis, and further management in older patients (>/=70 years, 487 patients [30.0%]) compared with younger ones (<70 years, 1134 [70.0%]). RESULTS: Older patients had more frequent melanomas of the head and neck (29.4% vs 8.7%; P < .001) and of the nodular, lentigo maligna, or acral lentiginous histologic subtypes. They had thicker and more frequently ulcerated tumors, categorized as T3 or T4 in 36.7% of cases vs 20.1% in younger patients. Diagnosis of melanoma occurred more frequently in a general practice setting and less frequently in direct consultation with a dermatologist or regular screening for skin cancer. Time to definitive excision was longer in older patients, and 16.8% of them compared with 5.0% of the younger population had insufficient excision margins (P < .001). A sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 23.3% of the older patients with melanoma thicker than 1 mm vs 41.4% in the younger patients (P < .001). Adjuvant therapy was less frequently started in older patients and was prematurely stopped in a higher proportion of that population. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Age-related variations are observed at every step of melanoma management. The most important concerns are access of elderly people to settings for early diagnosis and excision with appropriate margins.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Child Female France Head and Neck Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/*therapy Humans Life Expectancy Male Mass Screening/*methods Melanoma/diagnosis/pathology/*therapy Middle Aged Neoplasm Staging Questionnaires Retrospective Studies Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/*therapy Time Factors Young Adult"

Considerable barriers exist for Hispanic Americans consent to donation, resulting in significantly lower donation rates compared with white individuals. Objective: To investigate the effect of an aggressive outreach intervention during a 5-year period aimed at improving organ donation rates among Hispanic Americans. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective longitudinal observation study of organ donors treated at a major metropolitan level I trauma center. The center provides most of the medical care to the 4 Southern California neighborhoods with a high percentage of Hispanic Americans that were included in the study. Interventions: Television and radio media campaigns and culturally sensitive educational programs implemented at high schools, churches, and medical clinics in the target neighborhoods. Main Outcome and Measure: Consent rate for organ donation recorded during the study. Results: Outreach interventions started in 2007 and were completed by 2012. Of 268 potential donors, 155 total donors (106 Hispanic Americans) provided consent during this time. A significant increase in consent rate was noted among Hispanic Americans, from 56% in 2005 to 83% in 2011 (P = .004); this increase was not evident in the population that was not Hispanic (67% in 2005 and 79% in 2011; P = .21). Conclusions and Relevance: Aggressive outreach programs can reduce the disparity between organ supply and demand by improving the consent rate among the target group.",Missing

Objective: To assess the risk of melanoma in pilots and airline crew. Data Sources: PubMed (1966 to October 30, 2013), Web of Science (1898 to January 27, 2014), and Scopus (1823 to January 27, 2014). Study Selection: All studies were included that reported a standardized incidence ratio (SIR), standardized mortality ratio (SMR), or data on expected and observed cases of melanoma or death caused by melanoma that could be used to calculate an SIR or SMR in any flight-based occupation. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Primary random-effect meta-analyses were used to summarize SIR and SMR for melanoma in any flight-based occupation. Heterogeneity was assessed using the chi2 test and I2 statistic. To assess the potential bias of small studies, we used funnel plots, the Begg rank correlation test, and the Egger weighted linear regression test. Main Outcomes and Measures: Summary SIR and SMR of melanoma in pilots and cabin crew. Results: Of the 3527 citations retrieved, 19 studies were included, with more than 266 431 participants. The overall summary SIR of participants in any flight-based occupation was 2.21 (95% CI, 1.76-2.77; P < .001; 14 records). The summary SIR for pilots was 2.22 (95% CI, 1.67-2.93; P = .001; 12 records). The summary SIR for cabin crew was 2.09 (95% CI, 1.67-2.62; P = .45; 2 records). The overall summary SMR of participants in any flight-based occupation was 1.42 (95% CI, 0.89-2.26; P = .002; 6 records). The summary SMR for pilots was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.27-2.63, P = .33; 4 records). The summary SMR for cabin crew was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.80-1.01; P = .97; 2 records). Conclusions and Relevance: Pilots and cabin crew have approximately twice the incidence of melanoma compared with the general population. Further research on mechanisms and optimal occupational protection is needed.",Missing
24965043,Generational increase in young women's drinking: a prospective analysis of mother-daughter dyads.,JAMA Psychiatry,Alati R and Betts KS and Williams GM and Najman JM and Hall WD,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Increases in alcohol use in young women over recent decades are shown by national survey data but have yet to be replicated using prospective data. OBJECTIVE: To compare change in alcohol use over a generation of young women born in Australia from 1981 to 1983 at 21 years with that of their mothers at the same age. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data came from the Mater University Study of Pregnancy, a prospective prebirth cohort study that recruited all pregnant mothers attending a hospital in Brisbane, Australia, from 1981 to 1983. The analyses were restricted to 1053 mothers who were aged 18 to 25 years of age at the baseline measurement and their daughters who were between the same ages when assessed 21 years later. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Assessing the increase in the same prospective measures of 4 levels of alcohol use between mothers and daughters. RESULTS: Multinomial logistic regression for clustered data indicated daughters were at greater odds of consuming high (odds ratio [OR] = 5.68 [95% CI, 4.24-7.57]) and moderate (OR = 2.81 [95% CI, 2.18-3.63]) levels of alcohol than their mothers. Not having a dependent child roughly doubled the odds of all levels of drinking in both cohorts. Undertaking or completing tertiary education had no effect on consumption. There was an interaction between mothers' or daughters' drinking and partner status (chi23 = 12.56; P = .007); having a partner doubled the daughters' odds of consuming high levels of alcohol (no partner: OR = 0.51 [95% CI, 0.31-0.80]) while the odds of drinking at the highest level were more than 5 times for mothers who were single (OR = 5.65 [95% CI, 2.99-12.35]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, we provide the first longitudinal evidence confirming that female alcohol use has dramatically increased over a generation, especially at higher levels of drinking. Later age at child bearing contributed to this increase and the relationship between alcohol use and having a partner was found to reverse alcohol consumption across the 2 generations.",Missing
23571590,New approaches to molecular diagnosis.,JAMA,Korf BR and Rehm HL,uab,"Advances in understanding the molecular basis of rare and common disorders, as well as in the technology of DNA analysis, are rapidly changing the landscape of molecular genetic and genomic testing. High-resolution molecular cytogenetic analysis can now detect deletions or duplications of DNA of a few hundred thousand nucleotides, well below the resolution of the light microscope. Diagnostic testing for ""single-gene"" disorders can be done by targeted analysis for specific mutations, by sequencing a specific gene to scan for mutations, or by analyzing multiple genes in which mutation may lead to a similar phenotype. The advent of massively parallel next-generation sequencing facilitates the analysis of multiple genes and now is being used to sequence the coding regions of the genome (the exome) for clinical testing. Exome sequencing requires bioinformatic analysis of the thousands of variants that are identified to find one that is contributing to the pathology; there is also a possibility of incidental identification of other medically significant variants, which may complicate genetic counseling. DNA testing can also be used to identify variants that influence drug metabolism or interaction of a drug with its cellular target, allowing customization of choice of drug and dosage. Exome and genome sequencing are being applied to identify specific gene changes in cancer cells to guide therapy, to identify inherited cancer risk, and to estimate prognosis. Genomic testing may be used to identify risk factors for common disorders, although the clinical utility of such testing is unclear. Genetic and genomic tests may raise new ethical, legal, and social issues, some of which may be addressed by existing genetic nondiscrimination legislation, but which also must be addressed in the course of genetic counseling. The purpose of this article is to assist physicians in recognizing where new approaches to genetic and genomic testing may be applied clinically and in being aware of the principles of interpretation of test results.","Adult Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/diagnosis/genetics Computational Biology Female *Genetic Counseling Genetic Diseases, Inborn/*diagnosis Genetic Testing/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/*trends Genome, Human Genomics/trends Humans Infant, Newborn Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics Male Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/ethics/*trends Pharmacogenetics Risk Assessment Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods Usher Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics"

23821092,"The paradox of disease prevention: celebrated in principle, resisted in practice.",JAMA,Fineberg HV,nas,"Prevention of disease is often difficult to put into practice. Among the obstacles: the success of prevention is invisible, lacks drama, often requires persistent behavior change, and may be long delayed; statistical lives have little emotional effect, and benefits often do not accrue to the payer; avoidable harm is accepted as normal, preventive advice may be inconsistent, and bias against errors of commission may deter action; prevention is expected to produce a net financial return, whereas treatment is expected only to be worth its cost; and commercial interests as well as personal, religious, or cultural beliefs may conflict with disease prevention. Six strategies can help overcome these obstacles: (1) Pay for preventive services. (2) Make prevention financially rewarding for individuals and families. (3) Involve employers to promote health in the workplace and provide incentives to employees to maintain healthy practices. (4) Reengineer products and systems to make prevention simpler, lower in cost, and less dependent on individual action. (5) Use policy to reinforce choices that favor prevention. (6) Use multiple media channels to educate, elicit health-promoting behavior, and strengthen healthy habits.

23839753,Medical management after coronary stent implantation: a review.,JAMA,Brilakis ES and Patel VG and Banerjee S,va,"IMPORTANCE: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stents is currently the most commonly performed coronary revascularization procedure; hence, optimizing post-PCI outcomes is important for all physicians treating such patients. OBJECTIVE: To review the contemporary literature on optimal medical therapy after PCI. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We performed a comprehensive search of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases for manuscripts on medical therapy after PCI, published between 2000 and February 2013. Bibliographies of the retrieved studies were searched by hand for other relevant studies. Priority was given to data from large randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Of the 6852 publications retrieved, 91 were included. FINDINGS: Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (eg, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) reduces the risk of stent thrombosis and subsequent cardiovascular events post-PCI (number needed to treat, 33-53) and is the current standard of care. Aspirin should be continued indefinitely and low dose (75-100 mg daily) is preferred over higher doses. A P2Y12 inhibitor should be administered for 12 months after PCI, unless the patient is at high risk for bleeding; however, ongoing studies are assessing the value of shorter or longer duration of P2Y12 inhibitor administration. In patients with acute coronary syndromes, prasugrel and ticagrelor further reduce cardiovascular ischemic events compared with clopidogrel but are associated with higher bleeding risk. If possible, noncardiac surgery should be delayed until 12 months after coronary stenting. Patients receiving coronary stents who require warfarin are at high risk for bleeding if they also receive dual antiplatelet therapy. Omission of aspirin may be advantageous in such patients. Routine platelet function or genetic testing is currently not recommended to tailor antiplatelet therapy after PCI. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Dual antiplatelet therapy remains the cornerstone of medical therapy after PCI. Continuous advances in pharmacotherapy can further enhance our capacity to improve outcomes in this high-risk patient group.","Aspirin/administration & dosage/adverse effects Drug Therapy, Combination Hemorrhage/chemically induced Humans *Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects Stents/*adverse effects Thrombosis/prevention & control Treatment Outcome"

OBJECTIVE: To assess the genetic overlap between PD and AD by testing for the presence of potentially pleiotropic loci in 2 recent GWA studies of PD and AD. DESIGN: Combined GWA analysis. SETTING: Data sets from the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Thousands of patients with AD or PD and their controls. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Meta-analysis of GWA studies of AD and PD. METHODS: To identify evidence for potentially pleiotropic alleles that increased the risk for both PD and AD, we performed a combined PD-AD meta-analysis and compared the results with those obtained in the primary GWA studies.We also tested for a net effect of potentially polygenic alleles that were shared by both disorders by performing a polygenic score analysis. Finally, we also performed a gene-based association analysis that was aimed at detecting genes that harbor multiple disease-causing single-nucleotide polymorphisms, some of which confer a risk of PD and some a risk of AD. RESULTS: Detailed interrogation of the single-nucleotide polymorphism, polygenic, and gene-based analyses resulted in no significant evidence that supported the presence of loci that increase the risk of both PD and AD. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our findings therefore imply that loci that increase the risk of both PD and AD are not widespread and that the pathological overlap could instead be ""downstream"" of the primary susceptibility genes that increase the risk of each disease.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Alzheimer Disease/*genetics Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data Europe Female Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics *Genome-Wide Association Study Genotype Humans Male Middle Aged Parkinson Disease/*genetics Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics Risk Factors United States"

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of erythropoietin and 2 hemoglobin transfusion thresholds (7 and 10 g/dL) on neurological recovery after traumatic brain injury. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial of 200 patients (erythropoietin, n = 102; placebo, n = 98) with closed head injury who were unable to follow commands and were enrolled within 6 hours of injury at neurosurgical intensive care units in 2 US level I trauma centers between May 2006 and August 2012. The study used a factorial design to test whether erythropoietin would fail to improve favorable outcomes by 20% and whether a hemoglobin transfusion threshold of greater than 10 g/dL would increase favorable outcomes without increasing complications. Erythropoietin or placebo was initially dosed daily for 3 days and then weekly for 2 more weeks (n = 74) and then the 24- and 48-hour doses were stopped for the remainder of the patients (n = 126). There were 99 patients assigned to a hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL and 101 patients assigned to 10 g/dL. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous erythropoietin (500 IU/kg per dose) or saline. Transfusion threshold maintained with packed red blood cells. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Glasgow Outcome Scale score dichotomized as favorable (good recovery and moderate disability) or unfavorable (severe disability, vegetative, or dead) at 6 months postinjury. RESULTS: There was no interaction between erythropoietin and hemoglobin transfusion threshold. Compared with placebo (favorable outcome rate: 34/89 [38.2%; 95% CI, 28.1% to 49.1%]), both erythropoietin groups were futile (first dosing regimen: 17/35 [48.6%; 95% CI, 31.4% to 66.0%], P = .13; second dosing regimen: 17/57 [29.8%; 95% CI, 18.4% to 43.4%], P < .001). Favorable outcome rates were 37/87 (42.5%) for the hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL and 31/94 (33.0%) for 10 g/dL (95% CI for the difference, -0.06 to 0.25, P = .28). There was a higher incidence of thromboembolic events for the transfusion threshold of 10 g/dL (22/101 [21.8%] vs 8/99 [8.1%] for the threshold of 7 g/dL, odds ratio, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.79], P = .009). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with closed head injury, neither the administration of erythropoietin nor maintaining hemoglobin concentration of greater than 10 g/dL resulted in improved neurological outcome at 6 months. The transfusion threshold of 10 g/dL was associated with a higher incidence of adverse events. These findings do not support either approach in this setting.

23804160,"Melanoma survival disadvantage in young, non-Hispanic white males compared with females.",JAMA Dermatol,Gamba CS and Clarke CA and Keegan TH and Tao L and Swetter SM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Worse survival among patients with melanoma has been demonstrated in middle-aged and older men compared with women, but few studies have explored survival differences by sex in adolescents and young adults, in whom melanoma is the third most common cancer. Focusing on sex disparities in survival among younger individuals may provide further evidence of biological rather than behavioral factors that affect melanoma outcome. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether long-term survival varies between white male and female adolescents and young adults with melanoma (15 to 39 years of age at diagnosis) in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort with a mean follow-up of 7.5 years of 26,107 non-Hispanic white adolescents and young adults with primary invasive melanoma of the skin diagnosed from January 1, 1989, through December 31, 2009, and reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results network of cancer registries. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Melanoma-specific survival. RESULTS: There were 1561 melanoma-specific deaths in the study population. Although adolescent and young adult males accounted for fewer overall melanoma cases (39.8%) than females, they comprised 63.6% of melanoma-specific deaths. Adolescent and young adult males were 55% more likely to die of melanoma than age-matched females after adjustment for tumor thickness, histologic subtype, presence and extent of metastasis, and anatomical location (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.39-1.73). Males were also more likely to die within each age range assessed (eg, 15-24, 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39 years), and even those with thin melanomas (</=1.00 mm) were twice as likely to die as age-matched females (hazard ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.57-2.42). Adjustment for health insurance and socioeconomic status in a subanalysis did not significantly alter these results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Male sex is associated with worse survival among white adolescents and young adults with melanoma after controlling for thickness and other prognostic factors. Continued public health efforts are necessary to raise awareness of the outcome of melanoma in young men.

23266500,Association of blood transfusion with increased mortality in myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis and diversity-adjusted study sequential analysis.,JAMA Intern Med,Chatterjee S and Wetterslev J and Sharma A and Lichstein E and Mukherjee D,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The benefit of blood transfusion in patients with myocardial infarction is controversial, and a possibility of harm exists. METHODS: A systematic search of studies published between January 1, 1966, and March 31, 2012, was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. English-language studies comparing blood transfusion with no blood transfusion or a liberal vs restricted blood transfusion strategy were identified. Two study authors independently reviewed 729 originally identified titles and abstracts and selected 10 for analysis. Study title, follow-up period, blood transfusion strategy, and mortality outcomes were extracted manually from all selected studies, and the quality of each study was assessed using the strengthening Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist. RESULTS: Studies of blood transfusion strategy in anemia associated with myocardial infarction were abstracted, as well as all-cause mortality rates at the longest available follow-up periods for the individual studies. Pooled effect estimates were calculated with random-effects models. Analyses of blood transfusion in myocardial infarction revealed increased all-cause mortality associated with a strategy of blood transfusion vs no blood transfusion during myocardial infarction (18.2% vs 10.2%) (risk ratio, 2.91; 95% CI, 2.46-3.44; P < .001), with a weighted absolute risk increase of 12% and a number needed to harm of 8 (95% CI, 6-17). Multivariate meta-regression revealed that blood transfusion was associated with a higher risk for mortality independent of baseline hemoglobin level, nadir hemoglobin level, and change in hemoglobin level during the hospital stay. Blood transfusion was also significantly associated with a higher risk for subsequent myocardial infarction (risk ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.06-3.93; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Blood transfusion or a liberal blood transfusion strategy compared with no blood transfusion or a restricted blood transfusion strategy is associated with higher all-cause mortality rates. A practice of routine or liberal blood transfusion in myocardial infarction should not be encouraged but requires investigation in a large trial with low risk for bias.",Anemia/etiology/therapy Blood Transfusion/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data Humans Myocardial Infarction/complications/*mortality/therapy Thrombolytic Therapy/adverse effects

To date, no analysis has had adequate statistical power to determine whether thrombolytic therapy is associated with improved survival, compared with conventional anticoagulation. OBJECTIVE: To determine mortality benefits and bleeding risks associated with thrombolytic therapy compared with anticoagulation in acute pulmonary embolism, including the subset of hemodynamically stable patients with right ventricular dysfunction (intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism). DATA SOURCES: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, EBSCO, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases from inception through April 10, 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials comparing thrombolytic therapy vs anticoagulant therapy in pulmonary embolism patients. Sixteen trials comprising 2115 individuals were identified. Eight trials comprising 1775 patients specified inclusion of patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently extracted trial-level data including number of patients, patient characteristics, duration of follow-up, and outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes were risk of recurrent embolism and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Peto odds ratio (OR) estimates and associated 95% CIs were calculated using a fixed-effects model. RESULTS: Use of thrombolytics was associated with lower all-cause mortality (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.88; 2.17% [23/1061] vs 3.89% [41/1054] with anticoagulants; number needed to treat [NNT] = 59) and greater risks of major bleeding (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.91-3.91; 9.24% [98/1061] vs 3.42% [36/1054]; number needed to harm [NNH] = 18) and ICH (OR, 4.63; 95% CI, 1.78-12.04; 1.46% [15/1024] vs 0.19% [2/1019]; NNH = 78). Major bleeding was not significantly increased in patients 65 years and younger (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.50-3.14). Thrombolysis was associated with a lower risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.74; 1.17% [12/1024] vs 3.04% [31/1019]; NNT = 54). In intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism trials, thrombolysis was associated with lower mortality (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25-0.92) and more major bleeding events (OR, 3.19; 95% CI, 2.07-4.92). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with pulmonary embolism, including those who were hemodynamically stable with right ventricular dysfunction, thrombolytic therapy was associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality and increased risks of major bleeding and ICH. However, findings may not apply to patients with pulmonary embolism who are hemodynamically stable without right ventricular dysfunction.","Acute Disease Anticoagulants/*adverse effects/therapeutic use Fibrinolytic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use Humans Intracranial Hemorrhages/*chemically induced/epidemiology Pulmonary Embolism/*drug therapy/mortality Recurrence Risk *Thrombolytic Therapy/adverse effects Treatment Outcome Ventricular Dysfunction, Right"

DATA SOURCE The FDA website for drug information and published literature. STUDY SELECTION All pediatric efficacy and pharmacokinetics trial data of drugs used for abortive treatment of migraine submitted to the FDA from January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patient demographic baseline characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, trial designs, efficacy end points, and pharmacokinetic profiles were analyzed and compared across drug products. RESULTS We analyzed data for sumatriptan succinate nasal spray and zolmitriptan, eletriptan hydrobromide, almotriptan malate, and rizatriptan benzoate tablets. Seven efficacy trials had a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial design. In 4 trials, patients were required to have a history of migraine attacks lasting at least 4 hours. High response rates for placebo were observed in all trials, with pain relief at 2 hours ranging from 53% to 57.5%. Nonrandomization of patients with an early placebo response design was used in the rizatriptan trial in 2011. Compared with the rizatriptan trial conducted in 1999, the 2011 rizatriptan trial reduced the placebo response rate by 6% for headache freedom at the 2-hour posttreatment end point owing to study design. The pharmacokinetic profiles between adolescents and adults were statistically similar. CONCLUSIONS High placebo response rates are consistent across all trials and may represent the principal challenge in pediatric trials of drugs for abortive treatment of migraine. Enrichment with selection of subjects with long-lasting migraine attacks is not sufficient to overcome high placebo response rates. Another enrichment strategy, the nonrandomization of patients with an early placebo response, successfully reduces the high placebo response rate for rizatriptan and is a trial design that should be considered for future pediatric trials of abortive migraine therapeutics.",Adolescent Humans Migraine Disorders/*drug therapy Placebo Effect Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Research Design Tryptamines/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use United States United States Food and Drug Administration
23478904,Complications following colonoscopy with anesthesia assistance: a population-based analysis.,JAMA Intern Med,Cooper GS and Kou TD and Rex DK,uhhospitals,"IMPORTANCE: Deep sedation for endoscopic procedures has become an increasingly used option but, because of impairment in patient response, this technique also has the potential for a greater likelihood of adverse events. The incidence of these complications has not been well studied at a population level. DESIGN: Population-based study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a 5% random sample of cancer-free Medicare beneficiaries who resided in one of the regions served by a SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) registry, we identified all procedural claims for outpatient colonoscopy without polypectomy from January 1, 2000, through November 30, 2009. INTERVENTION: Colonoscopy without polypectomy, with or without the use of deep sedation (identified by a concurrent claim for anesthesia services). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The occurrence of hospitalizations for splenic rupture or trauma, colonic perforation, and aspiration pneumonia within 30 days of the colonoscopy. RESULTS: We identified a total of 165 527 procedures in 100 359 patients, including 35 128 procedures with anesthesia services (21.2%). Selected postprocedure complications were documented after 284 procedures (0.17%) and included aspiration (n = 173), perforation (n = 101), and splenic injury (n = 12). (Some patients had >1 complication.) Overall complications were more common in cases with anesthesia assistance (0.22% [95% CI, 0.18%-0.27%]) than in others (0.16% [0.14%-0.18%]) (P < .001), as was aspiration (0.14% [0.11%-0.18%] vs 0.10% [0.08%-0.12%], respectively; P = .02). Frequencies of perforation and splenic injury were statistically similar. Other predictors of complications included age greater than 70 years, increasing comorbidity, and performance of the procedure in a hospital setting. In multivariate analysis, use of anesthesia services was associated with an increased complication risk (odds ratio, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.09-1.94]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although the absolute risk of complications is low, the use of anesthesia services for colonoscopy is associated with a somewhat higher frequency of complications, specifically, aspiration pneumonia. The differences may result in part from uncontrolled confounding, but they may also reflect the impairment of normal patient responses with the use of deep sedation.","Aged Colon/injuries *Colonoscopy Deep Sedation/*adverse effects Female Humans Intestinal Perforation/etiology Male Pneumonia, Aspiration/etiology Postoperative Complications SEER Program Splenic Rupture/etiology"

OBJECTIVE: To assess calibration and discrimination of the Pooled Cohort risk equations in a contemporary US population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 45 to 79 years enrolled in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study between January 2003 and October 2007 and followed up through December 2010. We studied participants for whom atherosclerotic CVD risk may trigger a discussion of statin initiation (those without clinical atherosclerotic CVD or diabetes, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level between 70 and 189 mg/dL, and not taking statins; n = 10,997). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Predicted risk and observed adjudicated atherosclerotic CVD incidence (nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease [CHD] death, nonfatal or fatal stroke) at 5 years because REGARDS participants have not been followed up for 10 years. Additional analyses, limited to Medicare beneficiaries (n = 3333), added atherosclerotic CVD events identified in Medicare claims data. RESULTS: There were 338 adjudicated events (192 CHD events, 146 strokes). The observed and predicted 5-year atherosclerotic CVD incidence per 1000 person-years for participants with a 10-year predicted atherosclerotic CVD risk of less than 5% was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.3-2.7) and 1.9, respectively, risk of 5% to less than 7.5% was 4.8 (95% CI, 3.4-6.7) and 4.8, risk of 7.5% to less than 10% was 6.1 (95% CI, 4.4-8.6) and 6.9, and risk of 10% or greater was 12.0 (95% CI, 10.6-13.6) and 15.1 (Hosmer-Lemeshow chi2 = 19.9, P = .01). The C index was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.70-0.75). There were 234 atherosclerotic CVD events (120 CHD events, 114 strokes) among Medicare-linked participants and the observed and predicted 5-year atherosclerotic CVD incidence per 1000 person-years for participants with a predicted risk of less than 7.5% was 5.3 (95% CI, 2.8-10.1) and 4.0, respectively, risk of 7.5% to less than 10% was 7.9 (95% CI, 4.6-13.5) and 6.4, and risk of 10% or greater was 17.4 (95% CI, 15.3-19.8) and 16.4 (Hosmer-Lemeshow chi2 = 5.4, P = .71). The C index was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.64-0.71). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort of US adults for whom statin initiation is considered based on the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort risk equations, observed and predicted 5-year atherosclerotic CVD risks were similar, indicating that these risk equations were well calibrated in the population for which they were designed to be used, and demonstrated moderate to good discrimination.",Aged Atherosclerosis/*epidemiology Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology Cohort Studies Female Humans Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use Hyperlipidemias/drug therapy Incidence Interviews as Topic Male Mathematical Concepts Middle Aged Risk Risk Assessment/*methods United States/epidemiology

OBJECTIVE: To study outcomes associated with warfarin treatment in relation to kidney function among patients with established cardiovascular disease and atrial fibrillation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational, prospective, multicenter cohort study from the Swedish Web-System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART) registry (2003-2010), which includes all Swedish hospitals that provide care for acute cardiac diseases. Participants included consecutive survivors of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) with atrial fibrillation and known serum creatinine (N = 24,317), including 21.8% who were prescribed warfarin at discharge. Chronic kidney disease stages were classified according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

Although the preoperative and intraoperative antibiotic management of acute calculous cholecystitis has been standardized, few data exist on the utility of postoperative antibiotic treatment. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of postoperative amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid on infection rates after cholecystectomy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A total of 414 patients treated at 17 medical centers for grade I or II acute calculous cholecystitis and who received 2 g of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 3 times a day while in the hospital before and once at the time of surgery were randomized after surgery to an open-label, noninferiority, randomized clinical trial between May 2010 and August 2012. INTERVENTIONS: After surgery, no antibiotics or continue with the preoperative antibiotic regimen 3 times daily for 5 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The proportion of postoperative surgical site or distant infections recorded before or at the 4-week follow-up visit. RESULTS: An imputed intention-to-treat analysis of 414 patients showed that the postoperative infection rates were 17% (35 of 207) in the nontreatment group and 15% (31 of 207) in the antibiotic group (absolute difference, 1.93%; 95% CI, -8.98% to 5.12%). In the per-protocol analysis, which involved 338 patients, the corresponding rates were both 13% (absolute difference, 0.3%; 95% CI, -5.0% to 6.3%). Based on a noninferiority margin of 11%, the lack of postoperative antibiotic treatment was not associated with worse outcomes than antibiotic treatment. Bile cultures showed that 60.9% were pathogen free.

23188026,Associations between aldosterone antagonist therapy and risks of mortality and readmission among patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.,JAMA,Hernandez AF and Mi X and Hammill BG and Hammill SC and Heidenreich PA and Masoudi FA and Qualls LG and Peterson ED and Fonarow GC and Curtis LH,duke,"CONTEXT: Aldosterone antagonist therapy for heart failure and reduced ejection fraction has been highly efficacious in randomized trials. However, questions remain regarding the effectiveness and safety of the therapy in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical effectiveness of newly initiated aldosterone antagonist therapy among older patients hospitalized with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using clinical registry data linked to Medicare claims from 2005 through 2010, we examined outcomes of eligible patients hospitalized with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. We used Cox proportional hazards models and inverse-weighted estimates of the probability of treatment to adjust for treatment selection bias. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause mortality, cardiovascular readmission, and heart failure readmission at 3 years, and hyperkalemia readmission at 30 days and 1 year. RESULTS: Among 5887 patients who met the inclusion criteria, the mean age was 77.6 years; of those 1070 (18.2%) started aldosterone antagonist therapy at discharge. Cumulative incidence rates among treated and untreated patients were 49.9% vs 51.2% (P = .62) for mortality; 63.8% vs 63.9% (P = .65) for cardiovascular readmission; and 38.7% vs 44.9% (P < .001) for heart failure readmission at 3 years; and 2.9% vs 1.2% (P < .001) for hyperkalemia readmission within 30 days and 8.9% vs 6.3% (P = .002) within 1 year. After inverse weighting for the probability of treatment, there were no significant differences in mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.96-1.14; P = .32) and cardiovascular readmission (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.91-1.09; P = .94). Heart failure readmission was lower among treated patients at 3 years (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.98; P = .02). Readmission associated with hyperkalemia was higher with aldosterone antagonist therapy at 30 days (HR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.51-4.29; P < .001) and 1 year (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.23-1.84; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of aldosterone antagonist therapy at hospital discharge was not independently associated with improved mortality or cardiovascular readmission but was associated with improved heart failure readmission among eligible older patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. There was a significant increase in the risk of readmission with hyperkalemia, predominantly within 30 days after discharge.","Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Data Collection Female Heart Failure/*drug therapy/*mortality/physiopathology Humans Hyperkalemia/chemically induced Male Medicare/statistics & numerical data Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Patient Discharge Patient Readmission Registries/statistics & numerical data Risk Stroke Volume/*drug effects Treatment Outcome United States/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis to separately evaluate the effects of ACEIs and ARBs on all-cause mortality, CV deaths, and major CV events in patients with DM. DATA SOURCES Data sources included MEDLINE (1966-2012), EMBASE (1988-2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, conference proceedings, and article reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: We included randomized clinical trials reporting the effects of ACEI and ARB regimens for DM on all-cause mortality, CV deaths, and major CV events with an observation period of at least 12 months. Studies were excluded if they were crossover trials. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Dichotomous outcome data from individual trials were analyzed using the risk ratio (RR) measure and its 95% CI with random-effects models. We estimated the difference between the estimates of the subgroups according to tests for interaction. We performed meta-regression analyses to identify sources of heterogeneity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end points were all-cause mortality and death from CV causes. Secondary end points were the effects of ACEIs and ARBs on major CV events. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 35 identified trials compared ACEIs with placebo or active drugs (32,827 patients) and 13 compared ARBs with no therapy (controls) (23,867 patients). When compared with controls (placebo/active treatment), ACEIs significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 13% (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78-0.98), CV deaths by 17% (0.83; 0.70-0.99), and major CV events by 14% (0.86; 0.77-0.95), including myocardial infarction by 21% (0.79; 0.65-0.95) and heart failure by 19% (0.81; 0.71-0.93). Treatment with ARBs did not significantly affect all-cause mortality (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.82-1.08), CV death rate (1.21; 0.81-1.80), and major CV events (0.94; 0.85-1.01) with the exception of heart failure (0.70; 0.59-0.82). Both ACEIs and ARBs were not associated with a decrease in the risk for stroke in patients with DM. Meta-regression analysis showed that the ACEI treatment effect on all-cause mortality and CV death did not vary significantly with the starting baseline blood pressure and proteinuria of the trial participants and the type of ACEI and DM. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduced all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and major CV events in patients with DM, whereas ARBs had no benefits on these outcomes. Thus, ACEIs should be considered as first-line therapy to limit excess mortality and morbidity in this population.",Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists/*therapeutic use Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use Cardiovascular Diseases/*drug therapy/mortality/prevention & control Cause of Death Diabetes Complications/prevention & control Diabetes Mellitus/*drug therapy Humans Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Regression Analysis Treatment Outcome

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and safety of ACEI/ARB use for advanced predialysis CKD in patients with hypertension and anemia. DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: From January 1, 2000, through June 30, 2009, we selected 28 497 hypertensive adult patients with CKD. Serum creatinine levels were greater than 6 mg/dL, hematocrit levels were less than 28%, and patients were treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. INTERVENTIONS: Users (n = 14,117) and nonusers (n = 14,380) of ACEIs/ARBs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for commencement of long-term dialysis and all-cause mortality for ACRI/ARB users vs nonusers. RESULTS: In a median follow-up of 7 months, 20,152 patients (70.7%) required long-term dialysis and 5696 (20.0%) died before progression to end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. Use of ACEIs/ARBs was associated with a lower risk for long-term dialysis (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.91-0.97]) and the composite outcome of long-term dialysis or death (0.94 [0.92-0.97]). The renal benefit of ACEI/ARB use was consistent across most patient subgroups, as was that of ACEI or ARB monotherapy. Compared with nonusers, the ACEI/ARB users had a higher hyperkalemia-associated hospitalization rate, but the risk of predialysis mortality caused by hyperkalemia was not significantly increased (HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.92-1.16]; P = .30). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with stable hypertension and advanced CKD who receive therapy with ACEIs/ARBs exhibit an association with lower risk for long-term dialysis or death by 6%.

25162367,Apolipoprotein E Genotype and the Diagnostic Accuracy of Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers for Alzheimer Disease.,JAMA Psychiatry,Lautner R and Palmqvist S and Mattsson N and Andreasson U and Wallin A and Palsson E and Jakobsson J and Herukka SK and Owenius R and Olsson B and Hampel H and Rujescu D and Ewers M and Landen M and Minthon L and Blennow K and Zetterberg H and Hansson O,Missing,"Importance: Several studies suggest that the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele modulates cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42). Whether this effect is secondary to the association of the APOE epsilon4 allele with cortical Abeta deposition or whether APOE epsilon4 directly influences CSF levels of Abeta42 independently of Abeta pathology remains unknown. Objective: To evaluate whether the APOE genotype affects the diagnostic accuracy of CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD), in particular Abeta42 levels, and whether the association of APOE epsilon4 with CSF biomarkers depends on cortical Abeta status. Design, Setting, and Participants: We collected data from 4 different centers in Sweden, Finland, and Germany. Cohort A consisted of 1345 individuals aged 23 to 99 years with baseline CSF samples, including 309 with AD, 287 with prodromal AD, 399 with stable mild cognitive impairment, 99 with dementias other than AD, and 251 controls. Cohort B included 105 nondemented younger individuals (aged 20-34 years) with CSF samples available. Cohort C included 118 patients aged 60 to 80 years with mild cognitive symptoms who underwent flutemetamol F 18 ([18F]flumetamol) positron emission tomography amyloid imaging and CSF tap. Exposures: Standard care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Abeta42 and total and phosphorylated tau in relation to the APOE epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 polymorphism in different diagnostic groups and in cases with or without cortical uptake of [18F]flutemetamol. Results: The CSF levels of Abeta42 but not total and phosphorylated tau were lower in APOE epsilon4 carriers compared with noncarriers irrespective of diagnostic group (cohort A). Despite this, CSF levels of Abeta42 differed between participants with AD when compared with controls and those with stable mild cognitive impairment, even when stratifying for APOE genotype (P < .001 to P = .006). Multiple binary logistic regression revealed that CSF levels of Abeta42 and APOE epsilon4 genotype were independent predictors of AD diagnosis. In cohort B, APOE epsilon4 carrier status did not influence CSF levels of Abeta42. Moreover, when stratifying for cortical uptake of [18F]flutemetamol in cohort C, APOE epsilon4 genotype did not influence CSF levels of Abeta42. This result was replicated in a cohort with individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B scanning. Conclusions and Relevance: Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Abeta42 are strongly associated with the diagnosis of AD and cortical Abeta accumulation independent of APOE genotype. The clinical cutoff for CSF levels of Abeta42 should be the same for all APOE genotypes.",Missing

The manure produced by these animals contains antibiotic-resistant bacteria, resistance genes, and antibiotics and is subsequently applied to crop fields, where it may put community members at risk for antibiotic-resistant infections. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between individual exposure to swine and dairy/veal industrial agriculture and risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A population-based, nested case-control study of primary care patients from a single health care system in Pennsylvania from 2005 to 2010. Incident MRSA cases were identified using electronic health records, classified as community-associated MRSA or health care-associated MRSA, and frequency matched to randomly selected controls and patients with skin and soft-tissue infection. Nutrient management plans were used to create 2 exposure variables: seasonal crop field manure application and number of livestock animals at the operation. In a substudy, we collected 200 isolates from patients stratified by location of diagnosis and proximity to livestock operations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Community-associated MRSA, health care-associated MRSA, and skin and soft-tissue infection status (with no history of MRSA) compared with controls. RESULTS: From a total population of 446,480 patients, 1539 community-associated MRSA, 1335 health care-associated MRSA, 2895 skin and soft-tissue infection cases, and 2914 controls were included. After adjustment for MRSA risk factors, the highest quartile of swine crop field exposure was significantly associated with community-associated MRSA, health care-associated MRSA, and skin and soft-tissue infection case status (adjusted odds ratios, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.13-1.69], 1.30 [95% CI, 1.05-1.61], and 1.37 [95% CI, 1.18-1.60], respectively); and there was a trend of increasing odds across quartiles for each outcome (P </= .01 for trend in all comparisons). There were similar but weaker associations of swine operations with community-associated MRSA and skin and soft-tissue infection. Molecular testing of 200 isolates identified 31 unique spa types, none of which corresponded to CC398 (clonal complex 398), but some have been previously found in swine. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Proximity to swine manure application to crop fields and livestock operations each was associated with MRSA and skin and soft-tissue infection.

25117131,Association between analytic strategy and estimates of treatment outcomes in meta-analyses.,JAMA,Dechartres A and Altman DG and Trinquart L and Boutron I and Ravaud P,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: A persistent dilemma when performing meta-analyses is whether all available trials should be included in the meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To compare treatment outcomes estimated by meta-analysis of all trials and several alternative analytic strategies: single most precise trial (ie, trial with the narrowest confidence interval), meta-analysis restricted to the 25% largest trials, limit meta-analysis (a meta-analysis model adjusted for small-study effect), and meta-analysis restricted to trials at low overall risk of bias. DATA SOURCES: One hundred sixty-three meta-analyses published between 2008 and 2010 in high-impact-factor journals and between 2011 and 2013 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews: 92 (705 randomized clinical trials [RCTs]) with subjective outcomes and 71 (535 RCTs) with objective outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: For each meta-analysis, the difference in treatment outcomes between meta-analysis of all trials and each alternative strategy, expressed as a ratio of odds ratios (ROR), was assessed considering the dependency between strategies. A difference greater than 30% was considered substantial. RORs were combined by random-effects meta-analysis models to obtain an average difference across the sample. An ROR greater than 1 indicates larger treatment outcomes with meta-analysis of all trials. Subjective and objective outcomes were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Treatment outcomes were larger in the meta-analysis of all trials than in the single most precise trial (combined ROR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.07-1.19]) for subjective outcomes and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.01-1.05) for objective outcomes). The difference in treatment outcomes between these strategies was substantial in 47 of 92 (51%) meta-analyses of subjective outcomes (meta-analysis of all trials showing larger outcomes in 40/47) and in 28 of 71 (39%) meta-analyses of objective outcomes (meta-analysis of all trials showing larger outcomes in 21/28). The combined ROR for subjective and objective outcomes was, respectively, 1.08 (95% CI, 1.04-1.13) and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00-1.06) when comparing meta-analysis of all trials and meta-analysis of the 25% largest trials, 1.17 (95% CI, 1.11-1.22) and 1.13 (95% CI, 0.82-1.55) when comparing meta-analysis of all trials and limit meta-analysis, and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.86-1.04) and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00-1.06) when comparing meta-analysis of all trials and meta-analysis restricted to trials at low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Estimation of treatment outcomes in meta-analyses differs depending on the strategy used. This instability in findings can result in major alterations in the conclusions derived from the analysis and underlines the need for systematic sensitivity analyses.",Confidence Intervals Humans *Meta-Analysis as Topic Odds Ratio Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Research Design *Treatment Outcome

Identifying predictive biomarkers of this effect could individualize therapy and decrease toxic effects. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that survival benefit associated with low-dose aspirin use after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer might depend on HLA class I antigen expression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cohort study with tumor blocks from 999 patients with colon cancer (surgically resected between 2002 and 2008), analyzed for HLA class I antigen and prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) expression using a tissue microarray. Mutation analysis of PIK3CA was also performed. Data on aspirin use after diagnosis were obtained from a prescription database. Parametric survival models with exponential (Poisson) distribution were used to model the survival. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival. RESULTS: The overall survival benefit associated with aspirin use after a diagnosis of colon cancer had an adjusted rate ratio (RR) of 0.53 (95% CI, 0.38-0.74; P < .001) when tumors expressed HLA class I antigen compared with an RR of 1.03 (0.66-1.61; P = .91) when HLA antigen expression was lost. The benefit of aspirin was similar for tumors with strong PTGS2 expression (0.68; 0.48-0.97; P = .03), weak PTGS2 expression (0.59; 0.38-0.97; P = .02), and wild-type PIK3CA tumors (0.55; 0.40-0.75; P < .001). No association was observed with mutated PIK3CA tumors (0.73; 0.33-1.63; P = .44). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Contrary to the original hypothesis, aspirin use after colon cancer diagnosis was associated with improved survival if tumors expressed HLA class I antigen. Increased PTGS2 expression or the presence of mutated PIK3CA did not predict benefit from aspirin. HLA class I antigen might serve as a predictive biomarker for adjuvant aspirin therapy in colon cancer.","Aspirin/*therapeutic use Cohort Studies Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality Cyclooxygenase 2/*analysis/genetics DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gene Expression Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*analysis Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Mutation Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*analysis Polymerase Chain Reaction Registries Tissue Array Analysis Tumor Markers, Biological/*analysis/genetics"
24146084,Role of bottle feeding in the etiology of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.,JAMA Pediatr,McAteer JP and Ledbetter DJ and Goldin AB,Missing,"IMPORTANCE Bottle feeding has been implicated in the etiology of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS). Further data are needed to define the nature of this relationship and the clinical variables that influence it. OBJECTIVE To determine if bottle feeding after birth is associated with the development of HPS in infants. We hypothesized that bottle feeding is associated with an increased risk of HPS and that this risk is modified by other risk factors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based case-control study of births from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2009, using Washington State birth certificates linked to hospital discharge data. Cases included all singleton infants born within the study period and subsequently admitted with both a diagnostic code for HPS and a procedure code for pyloromyotomy (n = 714). Controls were randomly chosen among singleton infants who did not develop HPS and were frequency matched to cases by birth year. EXPOSURE Feeding status (breast vs bottle) was coded on the birth certificate as the type of feeding the infant was receiving at birth discharge. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Diagnosis of HPS. RESULTS Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis incidence decreased over time, from 14 per 10,000 births in 2003 to 9 per 10,000 in 2009. Simultaneously, breastfeeding prevalence increased from 80% in 2003 to 94% in 2009. Compared with controls, cases were more likely to be bottle feeding after birth (19.5% vs 9.1%). After adjustment, bottle feeding was associated with an increased risk of HPS (odds ratio [OR], 2.31; 95% CI, 1.81-2.95). This association did not differ according to sex or maternal smoking status but was significantly modified by maternal age (<20 years OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.51-1.88; >/=35 years OR, 6.07; 95% CI, 2.81-13.10) and parity (nulliparous OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.07-2.38; multiparous OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 2.23-5.24). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Bottle feeding is associated with an increased risk of HPS, and this effect seems to be most important in older and multiparous women. These data suggest that bottle feeding may play a role in HPS etiology, and further investigations may help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed effect modification by age and parity.","Adult Bottle Feeding/*adverse effects Breast Feeding Case-Control Studies Female Humans Infant Logistic Models Male Prevalence Pyloric Stenosis, Hypertrophic/epidemiology/*etiology Risk Factors Washington"

This information might shed light on underlying pathological mechanisms involving inflammation and could be of clinical utility in the identification of persons at high risk of AMD who may benefit from increased adherence to lifestyle recommendations, eye examination schedules, and therapeutic protocols. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between hsCRP and future risk of AMD in US men and women. DESIGN: Pooled analysis of prospective nested case-control data from the Women's Health Study and 4 other cohorts, the Physicians' Health Study, Women's Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study, Nurses' Health Study, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. SETTING: A prospective nested case-control study within 5 large cohorts. PARTICIPANTS: Patients were initially free of AMD. We prospectively identified 647 incident cases of AMD and selected age- and sex-matched controls for each AMD case (2 controls for each case with dry AMD or 3 controls for each case of neovascular AMD). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We measured hsCRP in baseline blood samples. We used conditional logistic regression models to examine the relationship between hsCRP and AMD and pooled findings using meta-analytic techniques. RESULTS: After adjusting for cigarette smoking status, participants with high (>3 mg/L) compared with low (<1 mg/L) hsCRP levels had cohort-specific odds ratios (ORs) for incident AMD ranging from 0.94 (95% CI, 0.58-1.51) in the Physicians' Health Study to 2.59 (95% CI, 0.58-11.67) in the Women's Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study. After testing for heterogeneity between studies (Q = 5.61; P = .23), we pooled findings across cohorts and observed a significantly increased risk of incident AMD for high vs low hsCRP levels (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.06-2.08). Risk of neovascular AMD was also increased among those with high hsCRP levels (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.14-2.98). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Overall, these pooled findings from 5 prospective cohorts add further evidence that elevated levels of hsCRP predict greater future risk of AMD.

25208208,Direct Effect of Sunshine on Suicide.,JAMA Psychiatry,Vyssoki B and Kapusta ND and Praschak-Rieder N and Dorffner G and Willeit M,Missing,"Importance: It has been observed that suicidal behavior is influenced by sunshine and follows a seasonal pattern. However, seasons bring about changes in several other meteorological factors and a seasonal rhythm in social behavior may also contribute to fluctuations in suicide rates. Objective: To investigate the effects of sunshine on suicide incidence that are independent of seasonal variation. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective analysis of data on all officially confirmed suicides in Austria between January 1, 1970, and May 6, 2010 (n = 69 462). Data on the average duration of sunshine per day (in hours) were calculated from 86 representative meteorological stations. Daily number of suicides and daily duration of sunshine were differentiated to remove variation in sunshine and variation in suicide incidence introduced by season. Thereafter, several models based on Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. Main Outcomes and Measures: Correlation of daily number of suicides and daily duration of sunshine after mathematically removing the effects of season. Results: Sunshine hours and number of suicides on every day from January 1, 1970, to May 6, 2010, were highly correlated (r = 0.4870; P < 10-9). After differencing for the effects of season, a mathematical procedure that removes most of the variance from the data, a positive correlation between number of suicides and hours of daily sunshine remained for the day of suicide and up to 10 days prior to suicide (rmaximum = 0.0370; P < 10-5). There was a negative correlation between the number of suicides and daily hours of sunshine for the 14 to 60 days prior to the suicide event (rminimum = -0.0383; P < 10-5). These effects were found in the entire sample and in violent suicides. Conclusions and Relevance: Duration of daily sunshine was significantly correlated with suicide frequency independent of season, but effect sizes were low. Our data support the hypothesis that sunshine on the day of suicide and up to 10 days prior to suicide may facilitate suicide. More daily sunshine 14 to 60 days previously is associated with low rates of suicide. Our study also suggests that sunshine during this period may protect against suicide.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether shorter telomeres in leukocytes, especially CD8CD28- T cells, are associated with decreased resistance to upper respiratory infection and clinical illness in young to midlife adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between 2008 and 2011, telomere length was assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and T-cell subsets (CD4, CD8CD28+, CD8CD28-) from 152 healthy 18- to 55-year-old residents of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Participants were subsequently quarantined (single rooms), administered nasal drops containing a common cold virus (rhinovirus 39), and monitored for 5 days for development of infection and clinical illness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Infection (virus shedding or 4-fold increase in virus-specific antibody titer) and clinical illness (verified infection plus objective signs of illness). RESULTS: Rates of infections and clinical illness were 69% (n = 105) and 22% (n = 33), respectively. Shorter telomeres were associated with greater odds of infection, independent of prechallenge virus-specific antibody, demographics, contraceptive use, season, and body mass index (PBMC: odds ratio [OR] per 1-SD decrease in telomere length, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.08-2.72]; n = 128 [shortest tertile 77% infected; middle, 66%; longest, 57%]; CD4: OR, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.15-2.70]; n = 146 [shortest tertile 80% infected; middle, 71%; longest, 54%]; CD8CD28+: OR, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.21-3.09], n = 132 [shortest tertile 84% infected; middle, 64%; longest, 58%]; CD8CD28-: OR, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.29-3.16]; n = 144 [shortest tertile 77% infected; middle, 75%; longest, 50%]). CD8CD28- was the only cell population in which shorter telomeres were associated with greater risk of clinical illness (OR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.01-2.84]; n = 144 [shortest tertile, 26%; middle, 22%; longest, 13%]). The association between CD8CD28- telomere length and infection increased with age (CD8CD28- telomere length x age interaction, b = 0.09 [95% CI, 0.02-0.16], P = .01, n = 144). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this preliminary study among a cohort of healthy 18- to 55-year-olds, shorter CD8CD28- T-cell telomere length was associated with increased risk for experimentally induced acute upper respiratory infection and clinical illness.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors Antigens, CD28 Antigens, CD8 Common Cold/*genetics Disease Susceptibility Female Humans Male Middle Aged Odds Ratio Respiratory Tract Infections/*genetics/virology Rhinovirus Risk T-Lymphocytes *Telomere Shortening Young Adult"
23839752,Racial differences in the association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration with coronary heart disease events.,JAMA,Robinson-Cohen C and Hoofnagle AN and Ix JH and Sachs MC and Tracy RP and Siscovick DS and Kestenbaum BR and de Boer IH,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Low circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) have been consistently associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in white populations. This association has not been rigorously evaluated in other races or ethnicities, in which the distributions of 25(OH)D concentration and possibly other aspects of 25(OH)D metabolism differ. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of serum 25(OH)D concentration with risk of CHD in a multiethnic population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 6436 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), recruited from July 2000 through September 2002, who were free of known cardiovascular disease at baseline. We measured baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations using a mass spectrometry assay calibrated to established standards. We tested associations of 25(OH)D with adjudicated CHD events assessed through May 2012. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was time to first adjudicated CHD event, defined as myocardial infarction, angina, cardiac arrest, or CHD death. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 8.5 years, 361 participants had an incident CHD event (7.38 events per 1000 person-years). Associations of 25(OH)D with CHD differed by race/ethnicity (P for interaction < .05). After adjustment, lower 25(OH)D concentration was associated with a greater risk of incident CHD among participants who were white (n = 167 events; hazard ratio [HR], 1.26 [95% CI, 1.06-1.49] for each 10-ng/mL decrement in 25(OH)D) or Chinese (HR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.07-2.61]; n = 27). In contrast, 25(OH)D was not associated with risk of CHD in participants who were black (HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.73-1.20]; n = 94) or Hispanic (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.77-1.33]; n = 73). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Lower serum 25(OH)D concentration was associated with an increased risk of incident CHD events among participants who were white or Chinese but not black or Hispanic. Results evaluating 25(OH)D in ethnically homogeneous populations may not be broadly generalizable to other racial or ethnic groups.","Adult African Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Aged Aged, 80 and over Asian Americans/statistics & numerical data Coronary Disease/*blood/epidemiology/*ethnology European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Female Hispanic Americans/statistics & numerical data Humans Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies Risk United States/epidemiology Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/blood"
23689900,Association between a hospital's rate of cardiac arrest incidence and cardiac arrest survival.,JAMA Intern Med,Chen LM and Nallamothu BK and Spertus JA and Li Y and Chan PS,umich,"IMPORTANCE: National efforts to measure hospital performance in treating cardiac arrest have focused on case survival, with the hope of improving survival after cardiac arrest. However, it is plausible that hospitals with high case-survival rates do a poor job of preventing cardiac arrests in the first place. OBJECTIVE: To describe the association between inpatient cardiac arrest incidence and survival rates. DESIGN: Within a large, national registry, we identified hospitals with at least 50 adult in-hospital cardiac arrest cases between January 1, 2000, and November 30, 2009. We used multivariable hierarchical regression to evaluate the correlation between a hospital's cardiac arrest incidence rate and its case-survival rate after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The correlation between a hospital's incidence rate and case-survival rate for cardiac arrest. RESULTS: Of 102,153 cases at 358 hospitals, the median hospital cardiac arrest incidence rate was 4.02 per 1000 admissions (interquartile range, 2.95-5.65 per 1000 admissions), and the median hospital case-survival rate was 18.8% (interquartile range, 14.5%-22.6%). In crude analyses, hospitals with higher case-survival rates also had lower cardiac arrest incidence (r, -0.16; P = .003). This relationship persisted after adjusting for patient characteristics (r, -0.15; P = .004). After adjusting for potential mediators of this relationship (ie, hospital characteristics), the relationship between incidence and case survival was attenuated (r, -0.07; P = .18). The one modifiable hospital factor that most attenuated this relationship was a hospital's nurse-to-bed ratio (r, -0.12; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hospitals with exceptional rates of survival for in-hospital cardiac arrest are also better at preventing cardiac arrests, even after adjusting for patient case mix. This relationship is partially mediated by measured hospital attributes. Performance measures focused on case-survival rates seem an appropriate first step in quality measurement for in-hospital cardiac arrest.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/statistics & numerical data Female Heart Arrest/*epidemiology/mortality/therapy Hospitals Humans Incidence Inpatients/*statistics & numerical data Male Middle Aged Registries Risk Assessment Risk Factors Survival Rate Treatment Outcome United States/epidemiology"

However, the extent to which AF is a risk factor for MI has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: To examine the risk of incident MI associated with AF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort of 23,928 participants residing in the continental United States and without coronary heart disease at baseline were enrolled from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort between 2003 and 2007, with follow-up through December 2009. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Expert-adjudicated total MI events (fatal and nonfatal). RESULTS: Over 6.9 years of follow-up (median 4.5 years), 648 incident MI events occurred. In a sociodemographic-adjusted model, AF was associated with about 2-fold increased risk of MI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.96 [95% CI, 1.52-2.52]). This association remained significant (HR, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.26-2.30]) after further adjustment for total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, blood pressure-lowering drugs, body mass index, diabetes, warfarin use, aspirin use, statin use, history of stroke and vascular disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate, albumin to creatinine ratio, and C-reactive protein level. In subgroup analysis, the risk of MI associated with AF was significantly higher in women (HR, 2.16 [95% CI, 1.41-3.31]) than in men (HR, 1.39 [95% CI, 0.91-2.10]) and in blacks (HR, 2.53 [95% CI, 1.67-3.86]) than in whites (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 0.83-1.93]); for interactions, P = .03 and P = .02, respectively. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the risk of MI associated with AF in older (>/=75 years) vs younger (<75 years) participants (HR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.16-3.35] and HR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.11-2.30], respectively); for interaction, P = .44. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: AF is independently associated with an increased risk of incident MI, especially in women and blacks. These findings add to the growing concerns of the seriousness of AF as a public health burden: in addition to being a well-known risk factor for stroke, AF is also associated with increased risk of MI.","African Americans/statistics & numerical data Aged Atrial Fibrillation/*epidemiology/ethnology Cohort Studies Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Hypertension/epidemiology Male Middle Aged Myocardial Infarction/*epidemiology/ethnology Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/epidemiology Risk Factors Sex Factors United States/epidemiology"
24740586,Atypical cross talk between mentalizing and mirror neuron networks in autism spectrum disorder.,JAMA Psychiatry,Fishman I and Keown CL and Lincoln AJ and Pineda JA and Muller RA,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Converging evidence indicates that brain abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involve atypical network connectivity, but it is unclear whether altered connectivity is especially prominent in brain networks that participate in social cognition. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether adolescents with ASD show altered functional connectivity in 2 brain networks putatively impaired in ASD and involved in social processing, theory of mind (ToM) and mirror neuron system (MNS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging involving 25 adolescents with ASD between the ages of 11 and 18 years and 25 typically developing adolescents matched for age, handedness, and nonverbal IQ. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Statistical parametric maps testing the degree of whole-brain functional connectivity and social functioning measures. RESULTS: Relative to typically developing controls, participants with ASD showed a mixed pattern of both over- and underconnectivity in the ToM network, which was associated with greater social impairment. Increased connectivity in the ASD group was detected primarily between the regions of the MNS and ToM, and was correlated with sociocommunicative measures, suggesting that excessive ToM-MNS cross talk might be associated with social impairment. In a secondary analysis comparing a subset of the 15 participants with ASD with the most severe symptomology and a tightly matched subset of 15 typically developing controls, participants with ASD showed exclusive overconnectivity effects in both ToM and MNS networks, which were also associated with greater social dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adolescents with ASD showed atypically increased functional connectivity involving the mentalizing and mirror neuron systems, largely reflecting greater cross talk between the 2. This finding is consistent with emerging evidence of reduced network segregation in ASD and challenges the prevailing theory of general long-distance underconnectivity in ASD. This excess ToM-MNS connectivity may reflect immature or aberrant developmental processes in 2 brain networks involved in understanding of others, a domain of impairment in ASD. Further, robust links with sociocommunicative symptoms of ASD implicate atypically increased ToM-MNS connectivity in social deficits observed in ASD.","Adolescent Brain/*pathology/physiopathology Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/*pathology/physiopathology Cross-Sectional Studies Female Functional Neuroimaging/instrumentation/*methods Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Mirror Neurons/*pathology Nerve Net/*pathology/physiopathology Severity of Illness Index Theory of Mind/*physiology"

Immune responses can affect the brain and might increase the risk of mood disorders, but longitudinal studies of comorbidity are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of autoimmune diseases and infections on the risk of developing mood disorders. DESIGN: Nationwide, population-based, prospective cohort study with 78 million person-years of follow-up. Data were analyzed with survival analysis techniques and adjusted for calendar year, age, and sex. SETTING: Individual data drawn from Danish longitudinal registers. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3.56 million people born between 1945 and 1996 were followed up from January 1, 1977, through December 31, 2010, with 91, 637 people having hospital contacts for mood disorders. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The risk of a first lifetime diagnosis of mood disorder assigned by a psychiatrist in a hospital, outpatient clinic, or emergency department setting. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and accompanying 95% CIs are used as measures of relative risk. RESULTS: A prior hospital contact because of autoimmune disease increased the risk of a subsequent mood disorder diagnosis by 45% (IRR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.39-1.52). Any history of hospitalization for infection increased the risk of later mood disorders by 62% (IRR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.60-1.64). The 2 risk factors interacted in synergy and increased the risk of subsequent mood disorders even further (IRR, 2.35; 95% CI, 2.25-2.46). The number of infections and autoimmune diseases increased the risk of mood disorders in a dose-response relationship. Approximately one-third (32%) of the participants diagnosed as having a mood disorder had a previous hospital contact because of an infection, whereas 5% had a previous hospital contact because of an autoimmune disease. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Autoimmune diseases and infections are risk factors for subsequent mood disorder diagnosis.

23268516,"Prevalence of and risk factors for autopsy-determined atherosclerosis among US service members, 2001-2011.",JAMA,Webber BJ and Seguin PG and Burnett DG and Clark LL and Otto JL,usuhs,"CONTEXT: Autopsies of US service members killed in the Korean and Vietnam wars demonstrated that atherosclerotic changes in the coronary arteries can appear early in the second and third decades of life, long before ischemic heart disease becomes clinically apparent. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the current prevalence of coronary and aortic atherosclerosis in the US armed forces. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of all US service members who died of combat or unintentional injuries in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom/New Dawn between October 2001 and August 2011 and whose cardiovascular autopsy reports were available at the time of data collection in January 2012. Prevalence of atherosclerosis was analyzed by various demographic characteristics and medical history. Classifications of coronary atherosclerosis severity were determined prior to data analysis and designed to provide consistency with previous military studies: minimal (fatty streaking only), moderate (10%-49% luminal narrowing of >/=1 vessel), and severe (>/=50% narrowing of >/=1 vessel). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of coronary and aortic atherosclerosis in the US armed forces and by age, sex, self-reported race/ethnicity, education, occupation, service branch and component, military rank, body mass index at military entrance, and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, diagnoses of cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Of the 3832 service members included in the analysis, the mean age was 25.9 years (range, 18-59 years) and 98.3% were male. The prevalence of any coronary atherosclerosis was 8.5% (95% CI, 7.6%-9.4%); severe coronary atherosclerosis was present in 2.3% (95% CI, 1.8%-2.7%), moderate in 4.7% (95% CI, 4.0%-5.3%), and minimal in 1.5% (95% CI, 1.1%-1.9%). Service members with atherosclerosis were significantly older (mean [SD] age, 30.5 [8.1] years) than those without (mean [SD] age, 25.3 [5.6] years; P < .001). Comparing atherosclerosis prevalence among with those with no cardiovascular risk factor diagnoses (11.1% [95% CI, 10.1%-12.1%]), there was a greater prevalence among those with a diagnosis of dyslipidemia (50.0% [95% CI, 30.3%-69.7%]; age-adjusted prevalence ratio [PR], 2.09 [95% CI, 1.43-3.06]), hypertension (43.6% [95% CI, 27.3%-59.9%]; age-adjusted PR, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.34-2.65]), or obesity (22.3% [95% CI, 15.9%-28.7%]; age-adjusted PR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.10-1.96]), but smoking (14.1% [95% CI, 8.0%-20.2%]) was not significantly associated with a higher prevalence of atherosclerosis (age-adjusted PR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.73-1.74]).

OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive, multiyear analysis of health care costs by type of procedure within a large cohort of privately insured persons who underwent bariatric surgery compared with a matched nonsurgical cohort. DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of 2002-2008 claims data comparing a bariatric surgery cohort with a matched nonsurgical cohort. SETTING: Seven BlueCross BlueShield health insurance plans with a total enrollment of more than 18 million persons. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 29 820 plan members who underwent bariatric surgery between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008, and a 1:1 matched comparison group of persons not undergoing surgery but with diagnoses closely associated with obesity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardized costs (overall and by type of care) and adjusted ratios of the surgical group's costs relative to those of the comparison group. RESULTS: Total costs were greater in the bariatric surgery group during the second and third years following surgery but were similar in the later years. However, the bariatric group's prescription and office visit costs were lower and their inpatient costs were higher. Those undergoing laparoscopic surgery had lower costs in the first few years after surgery, but these differences did not persist. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Bariatric surgery does not reduce overall health care costs in the long term. Also, there is no evidence that any one type of surgery is more likely to reduce long-term health care costs. To assess the value of bariatric surgery, future studies should focus on the potential benefit of improved health and well-being of persons undergoing the procedure rather than on cost savings.","Adolescent Adult Aged *Bariatric Surgery/economics Comorbidity Cost of Illness Female Gastric Bypass Gastroplasty *Health Care Costs Humans Male Middle Aged Obesity/*economics/epidemiology/surgery Obesity, Morbid/economics/surgery United States Young Adult"

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether preoperative beta-blocker use within 24 hours of CABG surgery is associated with reduced perioperative mortality in a contemporary sample of patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Adult Cardiac database for 1107 hospitals performing cardiac surgery in the United States from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2012. Participants included 506,110 patients 18 years and older undergoing nonemergent CABG surgery who had not experienced a myocardial infarction in the prior 21 days or any other high-risk presenting symptom. We used logistic regression and propensity matching with a greedy 5-to-1 digit-matching algorithm to examine the association between beta-blocker use and the main outcomes of interest. EXPOSURES: Preoperative beta-blocker use. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of perioperative mortality, permanent stroke, prolonged ventilation, any reoperation, renal failure, deep sternal wound infection, and atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: Among the 506,110 patients undergoing CABG surgery who met the inclusion criteria, 86.24% received preoperative beta-blockers within 24 hours of surgery. In propensity-matched analyses that included 138,542 patients, we found no significant difference between patients who did and did not receive preoperative beta-blockers in rates of operative mortality (1.12% vs 1.17%; odds ratio [OR], 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87-1.06]; P = .38), permanent stroke (0.97% vs 0.98%; OR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.89-1.10]; P = .81), prolonged ventilation (7.01% vs 6.86%; OR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.98-1.07]; P = .26), any reoperation (3.60% vs 3.69%; OR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.92-1.03]; P = .35), renal failure (2.33% vs 2.24%; OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.97-1.11]; P = .30), and deep sternal wound infection (0.29% vs 0.34%; OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.71-1.04]; P = .12). However, patients who received preoperative beta-blockers within 24 hours of surgery had higher rates of new-onset atrial fibrillation when compared with patients who did not (21.50% vs 20.10%; OR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.06-1.12]; P < .001).

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether recent observations of the Mini Clinical Evaluation Exercise (Mini-CEX) performance of postgraduate year 1 physicians influence raters' scores of subsequent performances, consistent with either anchoring bias (scores biased similar to previous experience) or contrast bias (scores biased away from previous experience). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Internet-based randomized, blinded experiment using videos of Mini-CEX assessments of postgraduate year 1 trainees interviewing new internal medicine patients. Participants were 41 attending physicians from England and Wales experienced with the Mini-CEX, with 20 watching and scoring 3 good trainee performances and 21 watching and scoring 3 poor performances. All then watched and scored the same 3 borderline video performances. The study was completed between July and November 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was scores assigned to the borderline videos, using a 6-point Likert scale (anchors included: 1, well below expectations; 3, borderline; 6, well above expectations). Associations were tested in a multivariable analysis that included participants' sex, years of practice, and the stringency index (within-group z score of initial 3 ratings). RESULTS: The mean rating scores assigned by physicians who viewed borderline video performances following exposure to good performances was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.4-3.0) vs 3.4 (95% CI, 3.1-3.7) following exposure to poor performances (difference of 0.67 [95% CI, 0.28-1.07]; P = .001). Borderline videos were categorized as consistent with failing scores in 33 of 60 assessments (55%) in those exposed to good performances and in 15 of 63 assessments (24%) in those exposed to poor performances (P < .001). They were categorized as consistent with passing scores in 5 of 60 assessments (8.3%) in those exposed to good performances compared with 25 of 63 assessments (39.5%) in those exposed to poor performances (P < .001). Sex and years of attending practice were not associated with scores. The priming condition (good vs poor performances) and the stringency index jointly accounted for 45% of the observed variation in raters' scores for the borderline videos (P < .001). CONCLUSION: In an experimental setting, attending physicians exposed to videos of good medical trainee performances rated subsequent borderline performances lower than those who had been exposed to poor performances, consistent with a contrast bias.","*Clinical Competence Education, Medical, Graduate/*standards Educational Measurement/methods/*standards England Female Humans Internet Male Medical Staff, Hospital Observer Variation Single-Blind Method Video Recording Wales"
24042318,Extreme binge drinking among 12th-grade students in the United States: prevalence and predictors.,JAMA Pediatr,Patrick ME and Schulenberg JE and Martz ME and Maggs JL and O'Malley PM and Johnston LD,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of underage alcohol use has been studied extensively, but binge drinking among youth in the United States is not yet well understood. In particular, adolescents may drink much larger amounts than the threshold (5 drinks) often used in definitions of binge drinking. Delineating various levels of binge drinking, including extreme levels, and understanding predictors of such extreme binge drinking among youth will benefit public health efforts. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and predictors of 5+ (>/=5 drinks) binge drinking and of 10+ (>/=10 drinks) and 15+ (>/=15 drinks) extreme binge drinking among 12th graders in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A nonclinical nationally representative sample of high school seniors in the annual Monitoring the Future study between 2005 and 2011. The sample included 16,332 high school seniors (modal age, 18 years) in the United States. Response rates were 79.1% to 84.7%. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of consuming 5 or more, 10 or more, and 15 or more drinks in a row in the last 2 weeks. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2011, a total of 20.2% of high school seniors reported 5+ binge drinking, 10.5% reported 10+ extreme binge drinking, and 5.6% reported 15+ extreme binge drinking in the last 2 weeks. Rates of 5+ binge drinking and 10+ extreme binge drinking have declined since 2005, but rates of 15+ extreme binge drinking have not significantly declined. Students with college-educated parents were more likely to consume 5 or more drinks but were less likely to consume 15 or more drinks than students whose parents were not college educated. Students from more rural areas were more likely than students from large metropolitan areas to consume 15 or more drinks. Substance-related attitudes, socializing with substance-using peers, the number of evenings out with friends, and other substance use (cigarettes and marijuana) predicted all 3 levels of binge and extreme binge drinking. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Binge drinking at the traditionally defined 5+ drinking level was common among high school seniors representative of all 12th graders in the contiguous United States. A significant segment of students also reported extreme binge drinking at levels 2 and 3 times higher. These data suggest the importance of assessing multiple levels of binge drinking behavior and their predictors among youth to target effective screening and intervention efforts.",Adolescent Binge Drinking/*epidemiology Female Humans Logistic Models Male Prevalence Public Health Questionnaires Risk Factors Rural Population United States/epidemiology Urban Population

Fifty-three infants, randomized into one of four treatment groups, received 8 ml. per kilogram of a solution containing either (A) glucose in water, (B) salt-poor albumin, (C) NaHCO3, or (D) a combination of albumin and NaHCO3. After the initial infusion, the babies received no colloid or alkali solutions until 4 hours of age. We managed them supportively with warmth, appropriate oxygen administration, isotonic fluid infusion, and close monitoring. Among the infants who received alkali, 14 of 26 acquired the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 11 died, and four had intracranial hemorrhage. Among babies who received no alkali, RDS occurred in 11 of 27, 5 died, and none had intracranial hemorrhage. These results do not support the common practice of rapidly infusing NaHCO3 into high-risk, premature infants, and they suggest that the early management of such infants needs renewed critical evaluation.","Acidosis/*drug therapy Albumins/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Bicarbonates/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Carbon Dioxide/blood Cerebral Hemorrhage/mortality Female Hawaii Humans Hydrogen-Ion Concentration Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature, Diseases/blood/*drug therapy/mortality Infusions, Parenteral Male Prospective Studies Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/mortality Sodium/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Time Factors"
23817631,Biological vs. conventional combination treatment and work loss in early rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized trial.,JAMA Intern Med,Eriksson JK and Neovius M and Bratt J and Petersson IF and van Vollenhoven RF and Geborek P and Ernestam S,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The introduction of biological tumor necrosis factor inhibitors has improved the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but at a substantial cost. These drugs have been shown to lead to superior radiological outcomes compared with a combination of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs over 2 years. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether radiological superiority translates into better work loss outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, 2-arm, parallel, randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial. Patients with early RA (symptom duration <1 year) were recruited from 15 rheumatology clinics in Sweden from October 1, 2002, through December 31, 2005. The study population was restricted to working-age patients (aged <63 years). INTERVENTIONS: Patients who did not achieve low disease activity after 3 to 4 months of methotrexate therapy were randomized to receive additional biological treatment with infliximab or conventional combination treatment with sulfasalazine plus hydroxychloroquine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Monthly sick leave and disability pension days 21 months after randomization retrieved from the nationwide Swedish Social Insurance Office register. Main analyses were by intention to treat, including all patients, and adjusted for baseline sick leave and disability pension. RESULTS: Of 204 eligible patients, 105 were randomized to biological and 99 to conventional treatment. Seven patients in the biological and 4 in the conventional treatment group never received the study drug, and 72 and 52 patients, respectively, followed the study per protocol for 21 months. The baseline mean (SD) work loss was 17 (13) d/mo (median, 16 d/mo) in both groups (mean difference, 0.6 d/mo; 95% CI, -3.0 to 3.9). The mean changes in work loss at 21 months were -4.9 d/mo in the biological and -6.2 d/mo in the conventional treatment group (adjusted mean difference, 1.6 d/mo; 95% CI, -1.2 to 4.4). Including only patients receiving at least 1 dose of assigned treatment, the adjusted mean difference was 1.5 d/mo (95% CI, -1.5 to 4.4), and in per-protocol analysis the adjusted mean difference was 0.3 d/mo (95% CI, -2.8 to 3.8). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The radiological superiority of biological compared with conventional combination therapy did not translate into better work loss outcomes in patients with early RA who had experienced an insufficient response to methotrexate.

OBJECTIVES: To describe differences in microRNA expression in whole blood between patients with pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis, and healthy participants and to identify panels of microRNAs for use in diagnosis of pancreatic cancer compared with the cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A case-control study that included 409 patients with pancreatic cancer and 25 with chronic pancreatitis who had been included prospectively in the Danish BIOPAC (Biomarkers in Patients with Pancreatic Cancer) study (July 2008-October 2012) plus 312 blood donors as healthy participants. The microRNA expressions in pretreatment whole blood RNA samples were collected and analyzed in 3 randomly determined subcohorts: discovery cohort (143 patients with pancreatic cancer, 18 patients with chronic pancreatitis, and 69 healthy participants), training cohort (180 patients with pancreatic cancer, 1 patient with chronic pancreatitis, and 199 healthy participants), and validation cohort (86 patients with pancreatic cancer, 7 patients with chronic pancreatitis, and 44 healthy participants); 754 microRNAs were screened in the discovery cohort and 38 microRNAs in the training cohort and 13 microRNAs in the validation cohort. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Identification of microRNA panels (classifiers) for diagnosing pancreatic cancer. RESULTS: The discovery cohort demonstrated that 38 microRNAs in whole blood were significantly dysregulated in patients with pancreatic cancer compared with controls. These microRNAs were tested in the training cohort and 2 diagnostic panels were constructed comprising 4 microRNAs in index I (miR-145, miR-150, miR-223, miR-636) and 10 in index II (miR-26b, miR-34a, miR-122, miR-126*, miR-145, miR-150, miR-223, miR-505, miR-636, miR-885.5p). The test characteristics for the training cohort were index I area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82-0.90), sensitivity of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.79-0.90), and specificity of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.57-0.71); index II AUC of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), sensitivity of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.79-0.90), and specificity of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80-0.85); and CA19-9 AUC of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.94), sensitivity of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.80-0.90), and specificity of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.96-1.00). Performances were strengthened in the validation cohort by combining panels and CA19-9 (index I AUC of 0.94 [95% CI, 0.90-0.98] and index II AUC of 0.93 [95% CI, 0.89-0.97]). Compared with CA19-9 alone, the AUC for the combination of index I and CA19-9 was significantly higher (P = .01). The performance of the panels in patients with stage IA-IIB pancreatic cancer was index I AUC of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.73-0.87); index I and CA19-9 AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.90); index II AUC of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.94); and index II and CA19-9 AUC of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.86-0.95). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study identified 2 diagnostic panels based on microRNA expression in whole blood with the potential to distinguish patients with pancreatic cancer from healthy controls. Further research is necessary to understand whether these have clinical implications for early detection of pancreatic cancer and how much this information adds to serum CA19-9.","Adult Aged CA-19-9 Antigen/blood Case-Control Studies Diagnosis, Differential Female Humans Male MicroRNAs/*blood/metabolism Middle Aged Pancreatic Neoplasms/blood/*diagnosis Pancreatitis, Chronic/blood/*diagnosis Sensitivity and Specificity Tumor Markers, Biological/blood"
25111880,Effect of Bisphosphonate Use on Risk of Postmenopausal Breast Cancer: Results From the Randomized Clinical Trials of Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid.,JAMA Intern Med,Hue TF and Cummings SR and Cauley JA and Bauer DC and Ensrud KE and Barrett-Connor E and Black DM,Missing,"Importance: Studies have shown that bisphosphonates may have antitumor and antimetastatic properties. Recently, observational studies have suggested a possible protective effect of bisphosphonates on breast cancer, but the effect of bisphosphonate use on risk of breast cancer has not been tested in randomized trials. Objective: To assess the relationship of postmenopausal breast cancer incidence and bisphosphonate use using data from 2 randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) randomly assigned 6459 women aged 55 to 81 years to alendronate or placebo for a mean follow-up of 3.8 years. The Health Outcomes and Reduced Incidence With Zoledronic Acid Once Yearly-Pivotal Fracture Trial (HORIZON-PFT) randomly assigned 7765 women aged 65 to 89 years to annual intravenous zoledronic acid or placebo for a mean follow-up of 2.8 years. Data were collected at clinical centers in the United States (FIT and HORIZON-PFT) and in Asia and the Pacific, Europe, North America, and South America (HORIZON-PFT). Women, in either study, with recurrent breast cancer or who reported a history of breast cancer were excluded from analyses. In each trial, a blinded review was conducted of each cancer adverse event report to verify incident invasive breast cancer cases. The primary analysis compared events in the active vs placebo group using a log-rank test. Intervention: Alendronate vs placebo (FIT) or zoledronic acid vs placebo (HORIZON-PFT). Main Outcomes and Measures: Hazard ratio for incident breast cancer in the bisphosphonate treatment group compared to the placebo group. Results: There was no significant difference in the rate of breast cancer in FIT: 1.5% (n = 46) in the placebo group and 1.8% (n = 57) in the alendronate group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.24 [95% CI, 0.84-1.83]). In HORIZON-PFT, there was also no significant difference: 0.8% (n = 29) in the placebo group and 0.9% (n = 33) in the zoledronic acid group (HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.70-1.89]). There was also no significant difference when the data from FIT and HORIZON-PFT were pooled (HR, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.89-1.63]). Conclusions and Relevance: These 2 randomized clinical trials do not support the findings from observational research. Contrary to the results from observational studies, we found that 3 to 4 years of bisphosphonate treatment did not decrease the risk of invasive postmenopausal breast cancer.

24627036,Blood biomarkers for brain injury in concussed professional ice hockey players.,JAMA Neurol,Shahim P and Tegner Y and Wilson DH and Randall J and Skillback T and Pazooki D and Kallberg B and Blennow K and Zetterberg H,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Lack of objective biomarkers for brain damage hampers acute diagnosis and clinical decision making about return to play after sports-related concussion. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether sports-related concussion is associated with elevated levels of blood biochemical markers of injury to the central nervous system and to assess whether plasma levels of these biomarkers predict return to play in professional ice hockey players with sports-related concussion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter prospective cohort study involving all 12 teams of the top professional ice hockey league in Sweden, the Swedish Hockey League. Two hundred eighty-eight professional ice hockey players from 12 teams contesting during the 2012-2013 season consented to participate. All players underwent clinical preseason baseline testing regarding concussion assessment measures. Forty-seven players from 2 of the 12 ice hockey teams underwent blood sampling prior to the start of the season. Thirty-five players had a concussion from September 13, 2012, to January 31, 2013; of these players, 28 underwent repeated blood sampling at 1, 12, 36, and 144 hours and when the players returned to play. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Total tau, S-100 calcium-binding protein B, and neuron-specific enolase concentrations in plasma and serum were measured. RESULTS: Concussed players had increased levels of the axonal injury biomarker total tau(median, 10.0 pg/mL; range, 2.0-102 pg/mL) compared with preseason values (median, 4.5pg/mL; range, 0.06-22.7 pg/mL) (P < .001). The levels of the astroglial injury biomarker S-100 calcium-binding protein B were also increased in players with sports-related concussion(median, 0.075 mug/L; range, 0.037-0.24 mug/L) compared with preseason values (median,0.045 mug/L; range, 0.005-0.45 mug/L) (P < .001). The highest biomarker concentrations of total tau and S-100 calcium-binding protein B were measured immediately after a concussion, and they decreased during rehabilitation. No significant changes were detected in the levels of neuron-specific enolase from preseason values (median, 6.5 mug/L; range,3.45-18.0 mug/L) to postconcussion values (median, 6.1 mug/L; range, 3.6-12.8 mug/L) (P = .10). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Sports-related concussion in professional ice hockey players is associated with acute axonal and astroglial injury.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adding information on HbA1c values to conventional cardiovascular risk factors is associated with improvement in prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of individual-participant data available from 73 prospective studies involving 294,998 participants without a known history of diabetes mellitus or CVD at the baseline assessment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Measures of risk discrimination for CVD outcomes (eg, C-index) and reclassification (eg, net reclassification improvement) of participants across predicted 10-year risk categories of low (<5%), intermediate (5% to <7.5%), and high (>/= 7.5%) risk. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 9.9 (interquartile range, 7.6-13.2) years, 20,840 incident fatal and nonfatal CVD outcomes (13,237 coronary heart disease and 7603 stroke outcomes) were recorded. In analyses adjusted for several conventional cardiovascular risk factors, there was an approximately J-shaped association between HbA1c values and CVD risk. The association between HbA1c values and CVD risk changed only slightly after adjustment for total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations or estimated glomerular filtration rate, but this association attenuated somewhat after adjustment for concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein. The C-index for a CVD risk prediction model containing conventional cardiovascular risk factors alone was 0.7434 (95% CI, 0.7350 to 0.7517). The addition of information on HbA1c was associated with a C-index change of 0.0018 (0.0003 to 0.0033) and a net reclassification improvement of 0.42 (-0.63 to 1.48) for the categories of predicted 10-year CVD risk. The improvement provided by HbA1c assessment in prediction of CVD risk was equal to or better than estimated improvements for measurement of fasting, random, or postload plasma glucose levels. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a study of individuals without known CVD or diabetes, additional assessment of HbA1c values in the context of CVD risk assessment provided little incremental benefit for prediction of CVD risk.","Aged C-Reactive Protein/analysis Cholesterol, HDL/blood Coronary Disease/*epidemiology Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology Female Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated/*analysis Humans Male Middle Aged Predictive Value of Tests Prospective Studies Risk Assessment/*methods Stroke/*epidemiology"
25090293,Blood lead concentrations and children's behavioral and emotional problems: a cohort study.,JAMA Pediatr,Liu J and Liu X and Wang W and McCauley L and Pinto-Martin J and Wang Y and Li L and Yan C and Rogan WJ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The association between lead exposure and children's IQ has been well studied, but few studies have examined the effects of blood lead concentrations on children's behavior. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between blood lead concentrations and behavioral problems in a community sample of Chinese preschool children with a mean blood lead concentration of less than 10 microg/dL. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort study was conducted at 4 preschools in Jintan, Jiangsu province of China. Participants included 1341 children aged 3 to 5 years. EXPOSURES: Lead. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Blood lead concentrations were measured in children aged 3 to 5 years. Behavioral problems were assessed using Chinese versions of the Child Behavior Checklist and Caregiver-Teacher Report Form when children were aged 6 years. RESULTS: The mean (SD) blood lead concentration was 6.4 (2.6) microg/dL, with the 75th and 90th percentiles being 7.5 and 9.4 microg/dL, respectively. General linear modeling showed significant associations between blood lead concentrations and increased scores for teacher-reported behavioral problems. A 1-microg/dL increase in the blood lead concentration resulted in a 0.322 (95% CI, 0.058 to 0.587), 0.253 (95% CI, 0.016 to 0.500), and 0.303 (95% CI, 0.046 to 0.560) increase of teacher-reported behavior scores on emotional reactivity, anxiety problems, and pervasive developmental problems, respectively (P < .05), with adjustment for parental and child variables. Spline modeling showed that mean teacher-reported behavior scores increased with blood lead concentrations, particularly for older girls. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Blood lead concentrations, even at a mean concentration of 6.4 microg/dL, were associated with increased risk of behavioral problems in Chinese preschool children, including internalizing and pervasive developmental problems. This association showed different patterns depending on age and sex. As such, continued monitoring of blood lead concentrations, as well as clinical assessments of mental behavior during regular pediatric visits, may be warranted.",Missing
24570247,Patterns and outcomes of red blood cell transfusion in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.,JAMA,Sherwood MW and Wang Y and Curtis JP and Peterson ED and Rao SV,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Studies have shown variation in the use of red blood cell transfusion among patients with acute coronary syndromes. There are no definitive data for the efficacy of transfusion in improving outcomes, and concerning data exist about possible association with harm. Current transfusion practices in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To determine the current patterns of blood transfusion among patients undergoing PCI and the association of transfusion with adverse cardiac outcomes across hospitals in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of all patient visits from the CathPCI Registry from July 2009 to March 2013 that included PCI, excluding those with missing data on bleeding complications or who underwent in-hospital coronary artery bypass graft surgery (N = 2,258,711 visits). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Transfusion rates in the overall population and by hospital (N = 1431) were the primary outcomes. The association of transfusion with myocardial infarction, stroke, and death after accounting for a patient's propensity for transfusion was also measured. RESULTS: The overall rate of transfusion was 2.14% (95% CI, 2.13%-2.16%) and quarterly transfusion rates slightly declined from July 2009 to March 2013 (from 2.11% [95% CI, 2.03%-2.19%] to 2.04% [95% CI, 1.97%-2.12%]; P < .001). Patients who were more likely to receive transfusion were older (mean, 70.5 vs 64.6 years), were women (56.3% vs 32.5%), and had hypertension (86.4% vs 82.0%), diabetes (44.8% vs 34.6%), advanced renal dysfunction (8.7% vs 2.3%), prior myocardial infarction (33.0% vs 30.2%), or prior heart failure (27.0% vs 11.8%). Overall, 96.3% of sites gave a transfusion to less than 5% of patients and 3.7% of sites gave a transfusion to 5% of patients or more. Variation in hospital risk-standardized rates of transfusion persisted after adjustment, and hospitals showed variability in their transfusion thresholds. Receipt of transfusion was associated with myocardial infarction (42,803 events; 4.5% vs 1.8%; odds ratio [OR], 2.60; 95% CI, 2.57-2.63), stroke (5011 events; 2.0% vs 0.2%; OR, 7.72; 95% CI, 7.47-7.98), and in-hospital death (31,885 events; 12.5% vs 1.2%; OR, 4.63; 95% CI, 4.57-4.69), irrespective of bleeding complications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients undergoing PCI at US hospitals, there was considerable variation in blood transfusion practices, and receipt of transfusion was associated with increased risk of in-hospital adverse cardiac events.

24132685,A simple prediction rule for all-cause mortality in a cohort eligible for bariatric surgery.,JAMA Surg,Padwal RS and Klarenbach SW and Wang X and Sharma AM and Karmali S and Birch DW and Majumdar SR,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Current eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery use arbitrarily chosen body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) thresholds, an approach that has been criticized as arbitrary and lacking evidence. OBJECTIVES: To verify the importance of BMI as a mortality predictor, to identify other important mortality predictors, and to construct a mortality prediction rule in a population eligible for bariatric surgery. DESIGN: We studied individuals from a population-representative register who met contemporary eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery (BMI, >/=35.0 alone or 30.0-34.9 with an obesity-related comorbidity) from January 1, 1988, through December 31, 1998. We used binary logistic regression to construct a parsimonious model and a clinical prediction rule for 10-year all-cause mortality. SETTING: The United Kingdom General Practice Research Database, a population-representative primary care registry. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen thousand three hundred ninety-four patients aged 18 to 65 years. EXPOSURE: Bariatric surgery. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Ten-year all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Mean (SD) age was 46.9 (11.9) years, BMI was 36.2 (5.5), and 63.2% of the patients were women. All-cause mortality was 2.1%, and mean follow-up duration was 9.9 years. The final model, which included age (odds ratio, 1.09 per year [95% CI, 1.07-1.10]), type 2 diabetes mellitus (2.25 [1.76-2.87]), current smoking (1.62 [1.28-2.06]), and male sex (1.50 [1.20-1.87]), had a C statistic of 0.768. Although BMI significantly predicted mortality (odds ratio, 1.03 per unit [95% CI, 1.01-1.05]), it did not improve model discrimination or calibration. We divided clinical prediction rule scoring into 4 tiers. All-cause mortality was 0.2% in tier 1, 0.9% in tier 2, 2.0% in tier 3, and 5.2% in tier 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: All-cause 10-year mortality in obese individuals eligible for bariatric surgery can be estimated using a simple 4-variable prediction rule based on age, sex, smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Body mass index was not an important mortality predictor. Further work is needed to define low, moderate, and high absolute risk thresholds and to provide external validation.","Adolescent Adult Aged Bariatric Surgery/methods/*mortality *Body Mass Index *Cause of Death Cohort Studies Databases, Factual Female Follow-Up Studies Great Britain Hospital Mortality/trends Humans Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Obesity, Morbid/diagnosis/*surgery Odds Ratio Patient Selection Postoperative Complications/mortality Predictive Value of Tests Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Survival Rate Young Adult"
25058217,Nonmyeloablative HLA-matched sibling allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for severe sickle cell phenotype.,JAMA,Hsieh MM and Fitzhugh CD and Weitzel RP and Link ME and Coles WA and Zhao X and Rodgers GP and Powell JD and Tisdale JF,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative for children with severe sickle cell disease, but toxicity may be prohibitive for adults. Nonmyeloablative transplantation has been attempted with degrees of preparative regimen intensity, but graft rejection and graft-vs-host disease remain significant. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy, safety, and outcome on end-organ function with this low-intensity regimen for sickle cell phenotype with or without thalassemia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From July 16, 2004, to October 25, 2013, 30 patients aged 16-65 years with severe disease enrolled in this nonmyeloablative transplant study, consisting of alemtuzumab (1 mg/kg in divided doses), total-body irradiation (300 cGy), sirolimus, and infusion of unmanipulated filgrastim mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (5.5-31.7 x 10(6) cells/kg) from human leukocyte antigen-matched siblings. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was treatment success at 1 year after the transplant, defined as a full donor-type hemoglobin for patients with sickle cell disease and transfusion independence for patients with thalassemia. The secondary end points were the level of donor leukocyte chimerism; incidence of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease; and sickle cell-thalassemia disease-free survival, immunologic recovery, and changes in organ function, assessed by annual brain imaging, pulmonary function, echocardiographic image, and laboratory testing. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients survived a median 3.4 years (range, 1-8.6), with no nonrelapse mortality. One patient died from intracranial bleeding after relapse. As of October 25, 2013, 26 patients (87%) had long-term stable donor engraftment without acute or chronic graft-vs-host disease. The mean donor T-cell level was 48% (95% CI, 34%-62%); the myeloid chimerism levels, 86% (95% CI, 70%-100%). Fifteen engrafted patients discontinued immunosuppression medication with continued stable donor chimerism and no graft-vs-host disease. The normalized hemoglobin and resolution of hemolysis among engrafted patients were accompanied by stabilization in brain imaging, a reduction of echocardiographic estimates of pulmonary pressure, and allowed for phlebotomy to reduce hepatic iron. The mean annual hospitalization rate was 3.23 (95% CI, 1.83-4.63) the year before, 0.63 (95% CI, 0.26-1.01) the first year after, 0.19 (95% CI, 0-0.45) the second year after, and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.04-0.19) the third year after transplant. For patients taking long-term narcotics, the mean use per week was 639 mg (95% CI, 220-1058) of intravenous morphine-equivalent dose the week of their transplants and 140 mg (95% CI, 56-225) 6 months after transplant. There were 38 serious adverse events: pain and related management, infections, abdominal events, and sirolimus related toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among 30 patients with sickle cell phenotype with or without thalassemia who underwent nonmyeloablative allogeneic HSCT, the rate of stable mixed-donor chimerism was high and allowed for complete replacement with circulating donor red blood cells among engrafted participants.

24018960,Loss of fornix white matter volume as a predictor of cognitive impairment in cognitively normal elderly individuals.,JAMA Neurol,Fletcher E and Raman M and Huebner P and Liu A and Mungas D and Carmichael O and DeCarli C,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Magnetic resonance imaging markers of incipient cognitive decline among healthy elderly individuals have become important for both clarifying the biological underpinnings of dementia and clinically identifying healthy individuals at high risk of cognitive decline. Even though the role of hippocampal atrophy is well known in the later stages of decline, the ability of fornix-hippocampal markers to predict the earliest clinical deterioration is less clear. OBJECTIVES: To examine the involvement of the hippocampus-fornix circuit in the very earliest stages of cognitive impairment and to determine whether the volumes of fornix white matter and hippocampal gray matter would be useful markers for understanding the onset of dementia and for clinical intervention. DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort of cognitively normal elderly participants received clinical evaluations with T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and diffusivity scans during repeated visits over an average of 4 years. Regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze the relationships between fornix and hippocampal measures and their predictive power for incidence and time of conversion from normal to impaired cognition. SETTING: A cohort of community-recruited elderly individuals at the Alzheimer Disease Center of the University of California, Davis. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 102 cognitively normal elderly participants, with an average age of 73 years, recruited through community outreach using methods designed to enhance ethnic diversity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Our preliminary hypothesis was that fornix white matter volume should be a significant predictor of cognitive decline among normal elderly individuals and that fornix measures would be associated with gray matter changes in the hippocampus. RESULTS: Fornix body volume and axial diffusivity were highly significant predictors (P = .02 and .005, respectively) of cognitive decline from normal cognition. Hippocampal volume was not significant as a predictor of decline but was significantly associated with fornix volume and diffusivity (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This could be among the first studies establishing fornix degeneration as a predictor of incipient cognitive decline among healthy elderly individuals. Predictive fornix volume reductions might be explained at least in part by clinically silent hippocampus degeneration. The importance of this finding is that white matter tract measures may become promising candidate biomarkers for identifying incipient cognitive decline in a clinical setting, possibly more so than traditional gray matter measures.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Aging/*pathology Atrophy/pathology Cognition Disorders/*diagnosis Cohort Studies Diffusion Tensor Imaging Female Frontal Lobe/*pathology Hippocampus/*pathology Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Nerve Fibers, Myelinated/*pathology Neuropsychological Tests Outcome Assessment (Health Care) Predictive Value of Tests Proportional Hazards Models Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Regression Analysis"
23939787,Breastfeeding and obesity among schoolchildren: a nationwide longitudinal survey in Japan.,JAMA Pediatr,Yamakawa M and Yorifuji T and Inoue S and Kato T and Doi H,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Although it is suggested that breastfeeding is protective against obesity in children, the evidence remains inconclusive because of possible residual confounding by socioeconomic status or children's lifestyle factors. Most of the participants in the previous studies were children in Western developed countries, so studies in a different context are awaited. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of breastfeeding with overweight and obesity among schoolchildren in Japan, with adjustment for the potential confounders. DESIGN: Secondary data analyses of a nationwide longitudinal survey ongoing since 2001, with results collected from 2001 to 2009. SETTING: All over Japan. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 43,367 singleton children who were born after 37 gestational weeks and had information on their feeding during infancy. EXPOSURES: Five mutually exclusive infant feeding practice categories. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Underweight, normal weight (referent group), overweight, and obesity at 7 and 8 years of age defined by using international cutoff points of body mass index by sex and age. RESULTS: In multinomial logistic regression models with adjustment for children's factors (sex, television viewing time, and computer game playing time) and maternal factors (educational attainment, smoking status, and working status), exclusive breastfeeding at 6 to 7 months of age was associated with decreased risk of overweight and obesity compared with formula feeding. The adjusted odds ratios were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.69-1.05) and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.39-0.78) for overweight and obesity, respectively, at 7 years of age. Similar results were observed at 8 years of age. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Breastfeeding is associated with decreased risk of overweight and obesity among schoolchildren in Japan. Therefore, it would be better to encourage breastfeeding even in developed countries.",Body Composition Breast Feeding/*statistics & numerical data Child Female Health Surveys Humans Infant Japan/epidemiology *Life Style Logistic Models Longitudinal Studies Male Obesity/*epidemiology/prevention & control Overweight/*epidemiology Prevalence
23689820,Cardiovascular safety of inhaled long-acting bronchodilators in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,JAMA Intern Med,Gershon A and Croxford R and Calzavara A and To T and Stanbrook MB and Upshur R and Stukel TA,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common and deadly disease. Long-acting inhaled beta-agonists and anticholinergics, first-line medications for COPD, have been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes. When choosing between the medications, patients and physicians would benefit from knowing which has the least risk. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of these classes of medications with the risk of hospitalizations and emergency department visits for cardiovascular events. DESIGN: We conducted a nested case-control analysis of a retrospective cohort study. We compared the risk of events between patients newly prescribed inhaled long-acting beta-agonists and anticholinergics, after matching and adjusting for prognostic factors. SETTING: Health care databases from Ontario, the largest province of Canada, with a multicultural population of approximately 13 million. PARTICIPANTS: All individuals 66 years or older meeting a validated case definition of COPD, based on health administrative data, and treated for COPD from September 1, 2003, through March 31, 2009. EXPOSURE: New use of an inhaled long-acting beta-agonist or long-acting anticholinergic. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: An emergency department visit or a hospitalization for a cardiovascular event. RESULTS: Of 191 005 eligible patients, 53 532 (28.0%) had a hospitalization or an emergency department visit for a cardiovascular event. Newly prescribed long-acting inhaled beta-agonists and anticholinergics were associated with a higher risk of an event compared with nonuse of those medications (respective adjusted odds ratios, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.12-1.52; P < .001] and 1.14 [1.01-1.28; P = .03]). We found no significant difference in events between the 2 medications (adjusted odds ratio of long-acting inhaled beta-agonists compared with anticholinergics, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.95-1.38; P = .16]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among older individuals with COPD, new use of long-acting beta-agonists and anticholinergics is associated with similar increased risks of cardiovascular events. Close monitoring of COPD patients requiring long-acting bronchodilators is needed regardless of drug class.","Administration, Inhalation Aged Bronchodilator Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects Case-Control Studies Cholinergic Antagonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects Cohort Studies Female Heart Failure/chemically induced/prevention & control Humans Male Monitoring, Physiologic Ontario Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/*drug therapy Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Risk Factors Scopolamine Derivatives/*administration & dosage/adverse effects Treatment Outcome"

OBJECTIVE To examine the relationship between peer victimization and suicidal ideation or suicide attempts using meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched for articles from 1910 to 2013. The search terms were bully*, teas*, victim*, mobbing, ragging, and harassment in combination with the term suic*. Of the 491 studies identified, 34 reported on the relationship between peer victimization and suicidal ideation, with a total of 284,375 participants. Nine studies reported on the relationship between peer victimization and suicide attempts, with a total of 70,102 participants. STUDY SELECTION Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported an effect size on the relationship between peer victimization and suicidal ideation or suicide attempt in children or adolescents. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two observers independently coded the effect sizes from the articles. Data were pooled using a random effects model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES This study focused on suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Peer victimization was hypothesized to be related to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. RESULTS Peer victimization was found to be related to both suicidal ideation (odds ratio, 2.23 [95% CI, 2.10-2.37]) and suicide attempts (2.55 [1.95 -3.34]) among children and adolescents. Analyses indicated that these results were not attributable to publication bias. Results were not moderated by sex, age, or study quality. Cyberbullying was more strongly related to suicidal ideation compared with traditional bullying.

25163027,The Preventive Surgical Site Infection Bundle in Colorectal Surgery: An Effective Approach to Surgical Site Infection Reduction and Health Care Cost Savings.,JAMA Surg,Keenan JE and Speicher PJ and Thacker JK and Walter M and Kuchibhatla M and Mantyh CR,Missing,"Importance: Surgical site infections (SSIs) in colorectal surgery are associated with increased morbidity and health care costs. Objective: To determine the effect of a preventive SSI bundle (hereafter bundle) on SSI rates and costs in colorectal surgery. Design: Retrospective study of institutional clinical and cost data. The study period was January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2012, and outcomes were assessed and compared before and after implementation of the bundle on July 1, 2011. Setting and Participants: Academic tertiary referral center among 559 patients who underwent major elective colorectal surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the rate of superficial SSIs before and after implementation of the bundle. Secondary outcomes included deep SSIs, organ-space SSIs, wound disruption, postoperative sepsis, length of stay, 30-day readmission, and variable direct costs of the index admission. Results: Of 559 patients in the study, 346 (61.9%) and 213 (38.1%) underwent their operation before and after implementation of the bundle, respectively. Groups were matched on their propensity to be treated with the bundle to account for significant differences in the preimplementation and postimplementation characteristics. Comparison of the matched groups revealed that implementation of the bundle was associated with reduced superficial SSIs (19.3% vs 5.7%, P < .001) and postoperative sepsis (8.5% vs 2.4%, P = .009). No significant difference was observed in deep SSIs, organ-space SSIs, wound disruption, length of stay, 30-day readmission, or variable direct costs between the matched groups. However, in a subgroup analysis of the postbundle period, superficial SSI occurrence was associated with a 35.5% increase in variable direct costs ($13 253 vs $9779, P = .001) and a 71.7% increase in length of stay (7.9 vs 4.6 days, P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: The preventive SSI bundle was associated with a substantial reduction in SSIs after colorectal surgery. The increased costs associated with SSIs support that the bundle represents an effective approach to reduce health care costs.",Missing
24473795,Elevated serum pesticide levels and risk for Alzheimer disease.,JAMA Neurol,Richardson JR and Roy A and Shalat SL and von Stein RT and Hossain MM and Buckley B and Gearing M and Levey AI and German DC,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The causes of late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) are not yet understood but likely include a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Limited epidemiological studies suggest that occupational pesticide exposures are associated with AD. Previously, we reported that serum levels of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), the metabolite of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), were elevated in a small number of patients with AD (n=20). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between serum levels of DDE and AD and whether the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype modifies the association. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A case-control study consisting of existing samples from patients with AD and control participants from the Emory University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School's Alzheimer's Disease Center. Serum levels of DDE were measured in 79 control and 86 AD cases. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Serum DDE levels, AD diagnosis, severity of AD measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination score, and interaction with APOE4 status. RESULTS: Levels of DDE were 3.8-fold higher in the serum of those with AD (mean [SEM], 2.64 [0.35] ng/mg cholesterol) when compared with control participants (mean [SEM], 0.69 [0.1] ng/mg cholesterol; P < .001). The highest tertile of DDE levels was associated with an odds ratio of 4.18 for increased risk for AD (95% CI, 2.54-5.82; P < .001) and lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores (-1.605; range, -3.095 to -0.114; P < .0001). The Mini-Mental State Examination scores in the highest tertile of DDE were -1.753 points lower in the subpopulation carrying an APOE epsilon4 allele compared with those carrying an APOE epsilon3 allele (P interaction = .04). Serum levels of DDE were highly correlated with brain levels of DDE (rho = 0.95). Exposure of human neuroblastoma cells to DDT or DDE increased levels of amyloid precursor protein. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Elevated serum DDE levels are associated with an increased risk for AD and carriers of an APOE4 epsilon4 allele may be more susceptible to the effects of DDE. Both DDT and DDE increase amyloid precursor protein levels, providing mechanistic plausibility for the association of DDE exposure with AD. Identifying people who have elevated levels of DDE and carry an APOE epsilon4 allele may lead to early identification of some cases of AD.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Alleles Alzheimer Disease/blood/*chemically induced/genetics Amyloid beta-Peptides/drug effects Apolipoprotein E3/genetics Apolipoprotein E4/*genetics Apolipoproteins E Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies DDT/adverse effects Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/*adverse effects/blood Female Humans Insecticides/*adverse effects/blood Male Risk Severity of Illness Index Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects"

Nonamnestic mild cognitive impairment, a putative precursor of vascular and other non-Alzheimer dementias, is hypothesized to have a vascular etiology. DESIGN: A prospective, population-based, cohort study with a median 4.0 years of follow-up. SETTING: Olmsted County, Minnesota. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2719 participants were evaluated at baseline and every 15 months using the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, a neurological evaluation, and neuropsychological testing. A diagnosis of normal cognition, MCI, or dementia was made by consensus. Cardiac disease at baseline was assessed from the participant's medical records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident MCI, aMCI, or naMCI. RESULTS: Of 1450 participants without MCI or dementia at baseline, 366 developed MCI. Cardiac disease was associated with an increased risk of naMCI (hazard ratio, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.16-2.72]). However, the association varied by sex (P = .02 for interaction). Cardiac disease was associated with an increased risk of naMCI (hazard ratio, 3.07 [95% CI, 1.58-5.99]) for women but not for men (hazard ratio, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.68-1.99]). Cardiac disease was not associated with any type of MCI or with aMCI. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac disease is an independent risk factor for naMCI; within-sex comparisons showed a stronger association for women. Prevention and management of cardiac disease and vascular risk factors may reduce the risk of naMCI.","Aged Aged, 80 and over *Amnesia Cognition Disorders/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology Cohort Studies Female Follow-Up Studies Heart Diseases/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Population Surveillance/methods Prospective Studies Risk Factors Sex Factors"
24322595,Rates of complications and mortality in older patients with diabetes mellitus: the diabetes and aging study.,JAMA Intern Med,Huang ES and Laiteerapong N and Liu JY and John PM and Moffet HH and Karter AJ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: In the coming decades, the population of older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus is expected to grow substantially. Understanding the clinical course of diabetes in this population is critical for establishing evidence-based clinical practice recommendations, identifying research priorities, allocating resources, and setting health care policies. OBJECTIVE To contrast the rates of diabetes complications and mortality across age and diabetes duration categories. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study (2004-2010) included 72,310 older (>/= 60 years) patients with type 2 diabetes enrolled in a large, integrated health care delivery system. Incidence densities (events per 1000 person-years) were calculated for each age category (60-69, 70-79, and >/= 80 years) and duration of diabetes (shorter [0-9 years] vs longer [>/= 10 years]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident acute hyperglycemic events, acute hypoglycemic events (hypoglycemia), microvascular complications (end-stage renal disease, peripheral vascular disease, lower limb amputation, and diabetic eye disease), cardiovascular complications (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and congestive heart failure), and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Among older adults with diabetes of short duration, cardiovascular complications followed by hypoglycemia were the most common nonfatal complications. For example, among individuals aged 70 to 79 years with a short duration of diabetes, coronary artery disease and hypoglycemia rates were higher (11.47 per 1000 person-years and 5.03 per 1000 person-years, respectively) compared with end-stage renal disease (2.60 per 1000 person-years), lower limb amputation (1.28 per 1000 person-years), and acute hyperglycemic events (0.82 per 1000 person-years). We observed a similar pattern among patients in the same age group with a long duration of diabetes, with some of the highest incidence rates in coronary artery disease and hypoglycemia (18.98 per 1000 person-years and 15.88 per 1000 person-years, respectively) compared with end-stage renal disease (7.64 per 1000 person-years), lower limb amputation (4.26 per 1000 person-years), and acute hyperglycemic events (1.76 per 1000 person-years). For a given age group, the rates of each outcome, particularly hypoglycemia and microvascular complications, increased dramatically with longer duration of the disease. However, for a given duration of diabetes, rates of hypoglycemia, cardiovascular complications, and mortality increased steeply with advancing age, and rates of microvascular complications remained stable or declined. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Duration of diabetes and advancing age independently predict diabetes morbidity and mortality rates. As long-term survivorship with diabetes increases and as the population ages, more research and public health efforts to reduce hypoglycemia will be needed to complement ongoing efforts to reduce cardiovascular and microvascular complications.","Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over *Aging Diabetes Complications/*epidemiology Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment/*methods Risk Factors Survival Rate/trends United States/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVE: To undertake a comprehensive review of the literature and conduct an analysis of the outcomes of carotid interventions in the elderly. DESIGN AND SETTING: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify articles comparing early outcomes of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid stenting (CAS) in elderly and young patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Combined overall effect sizes were calculated using fixed or random effects models. Meta-regression models were formed to explore potential heterogeneity as a result of changes in practice over time. RESULTS Our analysis comprised 44 studies reporting data on 512,685 CEA and 75,201 CAS procedures. Carotid stenting was associated with increased incidence of stroke in elderly patients compared with their young counterparts (odds ratio [OR], 1.56; 95% CI, 1.40-1.75), whereas CEA had equivalent cerebrovascular outcomes in old and young age groups (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88-0.99). Carotid stenting had similar peri-interventional mortality risks in old and young patients (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72-1.03), whereas CEA was associated with heightened mortality in elderly patients (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.47-1.77). The incidence of myocardial infarction was increased in patients of advanced age in both CEA and CAS (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.57-1.72 and OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.16-1.45, respectively). Meta-regression analyses revealed a significant effect of publication date on peri-interventional stroke (P = .003) and mortality (P < .001) in CAS. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Age should be considered when planning a carotid intervention. Carotid stenting has an increased risk of adverse cerebrovascular events in elderly patients but mortality equivalent to younger patients. Carotid endarterectomy is associated with similar neurologic outcomes in elderly and young patients, at the expense of increased mortality.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Carotid Stenosis/surgery/ultrasonography Endarterectomy, Carotid/adverse effects/methods/*mortality Endovascular Procedures/methods/*mortality Female Geriatric Assessment *Hospital Mortality Humans Male Myocardial Infarction/etiology/mortality Postoperative Complications/mortality/physiopathology Prognosis Regression Analysis Risk Assessment *Stents Stroke/etiology/mortality Survival Analysis Treatment Outcome"

OBSERVATIONS: PGD and fertilization cycles resulted in detection of 6 F198S mutation-free embryos. Of these, 2 were selected for embryo transfer to the patient's uterus, yielding a clinical twin pregnancy and birth of healthy but slightly premature offspring with normal development at age 27 months. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: IVF with PGD is a viable option for couples who wish to avoid passing the disease to their offspring.

However, the feasibility and safety of this strategy have not previously been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usability and safety of Strategy for Off-site Rapid Triage (SORT) for Kids, a web-based decision support tool designed to translate clinical guidance developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help parents and adult caregivers determine if a child with influenza-like illness requires immediate care in an emergency department (ED). DESIGN: Prospective pilot validation study conducted between February 8 and April 30, 2012. Staff who abstracted medical records and made follow-up calls were blinded to the SORT algorithm's assessment of the child's level of risk. SETTING: Two pediatric emergency departments in the National Capital Region. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 294 parents and adult caregivers who were at least 18 years of age; able to read and speak English; and the parent or legal guardian of a child 18 years or younger presenting to 1 of 2 EDs with signs and symptoms meeting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for influenza-like illness. INTERVENTION: Completion of the SORT for Kids survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Caregiver ratings of the website's usability and the sensitivity of the underlying algorithm for identifying children who required immediate ED management of influenza-like illness, defined as receipt of 1 or more of 5 essential clinical services. RESULTS: Ninety percent of participants reported that the website was ""very easy"" to understand and use. Ratings did not differ by respondent race, ethnicity, or educational attainment. Of the 15 patients whose initial ED visit met explicit criteria for clinical necessity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention algorithm classified 14 as high risk, resulting in an overall sensitivity of 93.3% (exact 95% CI, 68.1%-99.8%). Specificity of the algorithm was poor. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This pilot study suggests that web-based decision support to help parents and adult caregivers self-triage children with influenza-like illness is feasible. However, prospective refinement of the clinical algorithm is needed to improve its specificity without compromising patient safety.","Adolescent Adult Aged Algorithms Attitude to Health Child Child, Preschool *Decision Support Techniques *Emergency Service, Hospital Feasibility Studies Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Influenza, Human/*therapy *Internet Male Middle Aged *Parents Pilot Projects Prospective Studies Risk Assessment Safety Sensitivity and Specificity Single-Blind Method Triage/*methods Young Adult"

Cariogenic bacteria have been shown to elicit a potent Th1 cytokine polarization and a cell-mediated immune response. OBJECTIVE: To test the association between dental caries and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case-control study in a comprehensive cancer center including all patients with newly diagnosed primary HNSCC between 1999 and 2007 as cases and all patients without a cancer diagnosis as controls. Those with a history of cancer, dysplasia, or immunodeficiency or who were younger than 21 years were excluded. EXPOSURES: Dental caries, fillings, crowns, and endodontic treatments, measured by the number of affected teeth; missing teeth. We also computed an index variable: decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident HNSCC. RESULTS: We included 620 participants (399 cases and 221 controls). Cases had a significantly lower mean (SD) number of teeth with caries (1.58 [2.52] vs 2.04 [2.15]; P = .03), crowns (1.27 [2.65] vs 2.10 [3.57]; P = .01), endodontic treatments (0.56 [1.24] vs 1.01 [2.04]; P = .01), and fillings (5.39 [4.31] vs 6.17 [4.51]; P = .04) but more missing teeth (13.71 [10.27] vs 8.50 [8.32]; P < .001) than controls. There was no significant difference in mean DMFT. After adjustment for age at diagnosis, sex, marital status, smoking status, and alcohol use, those in the upper tertiles of caries (odds ratio [OR], 0.32 [95% CI, 0.19-0.55]; P for trend = .001), crowns (OR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.26-0.84]; P for trend = .03), and endodontic treatments (OR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.30-1.01]; P for trend = .15) were less likely to have HNSCC than those in the lower tertiles. Missing teeth was no longer associated with HNSCC after adjustment for confounding. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is an inverse association between HNSCC and dental caries. This study provides insights for future studies to assess potential beneficial effects of lactic acid bacteria and the associated immune response on HNSCC.","Adult Aged Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*complications/pathology Case-Control Studies Dental Caries/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy Female Head and Neck Neoplasms/*complications/pathology Humans Life Style Male Middle Aged Oral Health Prevalence Risk Factors Socioeconomic Factors"

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of macrolide maintenance treatment for adults with non-CF bronchiectasis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The BAT (Bronchiectasis and Long-term Azithromycin Treatment) study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between April 2008 and September 2010 in 14 hospitals in The Netherlands among 83 outpatients with non-CF bronchiectasis and 3 or more lower respiratory tract infections in the preceding year. INTERVENTIONS: Azithromycin (250 mg daily) or placebo for 12 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of infectious exacerbations during 12 months of treatment. Secondary end points included lung function, sputum bacteriology, inflammatory markers, adverse effects, symptom scores, and quality of life. RESULTS: Forty-three participants (52%) received azithromycin and 40 (48%) received placebo and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. At end of study, the median number of exacerbations in the azithromycin group was 0 (interquartile range [IQR], 0-1), compared with 2 (IQR, 1-3) in the placebo group (P < .001). Thirty-two (80%) placebo-treated vs 20 (46%) azithromycin-treated individuals had at least 1 exacerbation (hazard ratio, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.16-0.51]). In a mixed-model analysis, change in forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration (percent of predicted) over time differed between groups (F1,78.8 = 4.085, P = .047), with an increase of 1.03% per 3 months in the azithromycin group and a decrease of 0.10% per 3 months in the placebo group. Gastrointestinal adverse effects occurred in 40% of patients in the azithromycin group and in 5% in the placebo group (relative risk, 7.44 [95% CI, 0.97-56.88] for abdominal pain and 8.36 [95% CI, 1.10-63.15] for diarrhea) but without need for discontinuation of study treatment. A macrolide resistance rate of 88% was noted in azithromycin-treated individuals, compared with 26% in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults with non-CF bronchiectasis, the daily use of azithromycin for 12 months compared with placebo resulted in a lower rate of infectious exacerbations. This could result in better quality of life and might influence survival, although effects on antibiotic resistance need to be considered.

Of these, 6574 had COPD, defined as a ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity below 0.7. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Baseline levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen and leukocyte count were measured in participants at a time when they were not experiencing symptoms of exacerbations. Exacerbations were recorded and defined as short-course treatment with oral corticosteroids alone or in combination with an antibiotic or as a hospital admission due to COPD. Levels of CRP and fibrinogen and leukocyte count were defined as high or low according to cut points of 3 mg/L, 14 mumol/L, and 9 x10(9)/L, respectively. RESULTS: During follow-up, 3083 exacerbations were recorded (mean, 0.5/participant). In the first year of follow-up, multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for having frequent exacerbations were 1.2 (95% CI, 0.7-2.2; 17 events/1000 person-years) for individuals with 1 high biomarker, 1.7 (95% CI, 0.9-3.2; 32 events/1000 person-years) for individuals with 2 high biomarkers, and 3.7 (95% CI, 1.9-7.4; 81 events/1000 person-years) for individuals with 3 high biomarkers compared with individuals who had no elevated biomarkers (9 events/1000 person-years; trend: P = 2 x 10(-5)). Corresponding hazard ratios using maximum follow-up time were 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1-1.8), 1.6 (95% CI, 1.3-2.2), and 2.5 (95% CI, 1.8-3.4), respectively (trend: P = 1 x 10(-8)). The addition of inflammatory biomarkers to a basic model including age, sex, FEV1 percent predicted, smoking, use of any inhaled medication, body mass index, history of previous exacerbations, and time since most recent prior exacerbation improved the C statistics from 0.71 to 0.73 (comparison: P = 9 x 10(-5)). Relative risks were consistent in those with milder COPD, in those with no history of frequent exacerbations, and in the 2 studies separately. The highest 5-year absolute risks of having frequent exacerbations in those with 3 high biomarkers (vs no high biomarkers) were 62% (vs 24%) for those with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades C-D (n = 558), 98% (vs 64%) in those with a history of frequent exacerbations (n = 127), and 52% (vs 15%) for those with GOLD grades 3-4 (n = 465). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Simultaneously elevated levels of CRP and fibrinogen and leukocyte count in individuals with COPD were associated with increased risk of having exacerbations, even in those with milder COPD and in those without previous exacerbations. Further investigation is needed to determine the clinical value of these biomarkers for risk stratification.","Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use Aged Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use Biological Markers/blood C-Reactive Protein/*analysis Disease Progression Female Fibrinogen/*analysis Forced Expiratory Volume Humans Inflammation/*blood *Leukocyte Count Male Middle Aged Odds Ratio Patient Admission/statistics & numerical data Prospective Studies Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/*blood/drug therapy/*physiopathology Risk Risk Assessment Severity of Illness Index Vital Capacity"
23532240,Effect of disodium EDTA chelation regimen on cardiovascular events in patients with previous myocardial infarction: the TACT randomized trial.,JAMA,Lamas GA and Goertz C and Boineau R and Mark DB and Rozema T and Nahin RL and Lindblad L and Lewis EF and Drisko J and Lee KL,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Chelation therapy with disodium EDTA has been used for more than 50 years to treat atherosclerosis without proof of efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To determine if an EDTA-based chelation regimen reduces cardiovascular events. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial randomized trial enrolling 1708 patients aged 50 years or older who had experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) at least 6 weeks prior and had serum creatinine levels of 2.0 mg/dL or less. Participants were recruited at 134 US and Canadian sites. Enrollment began in September 2003 and follow-up took place until October 2011 (median, 55 months). Two hundred eighty-nine patients (17% of total; n=115 in the EDTA group and n=174 in the placebo group) withdrew consent during the trial. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive 40 infusions of a 500-mL chelation solution (3 g of disodium EDTA, 7 g of ascorbate, B vitamins, electrolytes, procaine, and heparin) (n=839) vs placebo (n=869) and an oral vitamin-mineral regimen vs an oral placebo. Infusions were administered weekly for 30 weeks, followed by 10 infusions 2 to 8 weeks apart. Fifteen percent discontinued infusions (n=38 [16%] in the chelation group and n=41 [15%] in the placebo group) because of adverse events. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prespecified primary end point was a composite of total mortality, recurrent MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for angina. This report describes the intention-to-treat comparison of EDTA chelation vs placebo. To account for multiple interim analyses, the significance threshold required at the final analysis was P = .036. RESULTS: Qualifying previous MIs occurred a median of 4.6 years before enrollment. Median age was 65 years, 18% were female, 9% were nonwhite, and 31% were diabetic. The primary end point occurred in 222 (26%) of the chelation group and 261 (30%) of the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82 [95% CI, 0.69-0.99]; P = .035). There was no effect on total mortality (chelation: 87 deaths [10%]; placebo, 93 deaths [11%]; HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.70-1.25]; P = .64), but the study was not powered for this comparison. The effect of EDTA chelation on the components of the primary end point other than death was of similar magnitude as its overall effect (MI: chelation, 6%; placebo, 8%; HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.54-1.11]; stroke: chelation, 1.2%; placebo, 1.5%; HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.34-1.76]; coronary revascularization: chelation, 15%; placebo, 18%; HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.64-1.02]; hospitalization for angina: chelation, 1.6%; placebo, 2.1%; HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.35-1.47]). Sensitivity analyses examining the effect of patient dropout and treatment adherence did not alter the results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among stable patients with a history of MI, use of an intravenous chelation regimen with disodium EDTA, compared with placebo, modestly reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, many of which were revascularization procedures. These results provide evidence to guide further research but are not sufficient to support the routine use of chelation therapy for treatment of patients who have had an MI.

23903694,Atypical developmental patterns of brain chemistry in children with autism spectrum disorder.,JAMA Psychiatry,Corrigan NM and Shaw DW and Estes AM and Richards TL and Munson J and Friedman SD and Dawson G and Artru AA and Dager SR,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms emerging during early childhood. The pathophysiology underlying the disorder remains incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: To examine cross-sectional and longitudinal patterns of brain chemical concentrations in children with ASD or idiopathic developmental delay (DD) from 3 different age points, beginning early in the clinical course. DESIGN: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging data were acquired longitudinally for children with ASD or DD, and primarily cross-sectionally for children with typical development (TD), at 3 to 4, 6 to 7, and 9 to 10 years of age. SETTING: Recruitment, diagnostic assessments, and magnetic resonance imaging were performed at the University of Washington in Seattle. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-three children (45 with ASD, 14 with DD, and 14 with TD) at 3 to 4 years of age; 69 children (35 with ASD, 14 with DD, and 20 with TD) at 6 to 7 years of age; and 77 children (29 with ASD, 15 with DD, and 33 with TD) at 9 to 10 years of age. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), myo-inositol (mI), and glutamine plus glutamate (Glx) in cerebral gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) at 3 to 4, 6 to 7, and 9 to 10 years of age, and calculation of rates of change of these chemicals between 3 and 10 years of age. RESULTS: At 3 to 4 years of age, the ASD group exhibited lower NAA, Cho, and Cr concentrations than did the TD group in both GM and WM, alterations that largely were not observed at 9 to 10 years of age. The DD group exhibited reduced GM and WM NAA concentrations at 3 to 4 years of age; GM NAA concentrations remained reduced at 9 to 10 years of age compared with the TD group. There were distinct differences between the ASD and DD groups in the rates of GM NAA, Cho, and Cr changes between 3 and 10 years of age. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The GM chemical changes between 3 and 10 years of age differentiated the children with ASD from those with DD. Most notably, a dynamic reversal of GM NAA reductions was observed in the children with ASD. By contrast, persistent GM NAA reductions in the children with DD suggest a different, more static, underlying developmental process.","Age Factors Brain Chemistry/*physiology Cerebral Cortex/chemistry/physiopathology Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/diagnosis/*metabolism/*physiopathology Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Developmental Disabilities/diagnosis/*metabolism/*physiopathology Female Humans Longitudinal Studies Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/instrumentation/methods Male"
23613076,Educational achievement and economic self-sufficiency in adults after childhood bacterial meningitis.,JAMA,Roed C and Omland LH and Skinhoj P and Rothman KJ and Sorensen HT and Obel N,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: To our knowledge, no previous study has examined functioning in adult life among persons who had bacterial meningitis in childhood. OBJECTIVE: To study educational achievement and economic self-sufficiency in adults diagnosed as having bacterial meningitis in childhood. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Nationwide population-based cohort study using national registries of Danish-born children diagnosed as having meningococcal, pneumococcal, or Haemophilus influenzae meningitis in the period 1977-2007 (n=2784 patients). Comparison cohorts from the same population individually matched on age and sex were identified, as were siblings of all study participants. End of study period was 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative incidences of completed vocational education, high school education, higher education, time to first full year of economic self-sufficiency, and receipt of disability pension and differences in these outcomes at age 35 years among meningitis patients, comparison cohorts, and siblings. RESULTS: By age 35 years, among persons who had a history of childhood meningococcal (n=1338), pneumococcal (n=455), and H. influenzae (n=991) meningitis, an estimated 11.0% (41.5% vs 52.5%; 95% CI, 7.3%-14.7%), 10.2% (42.6% vs 52.8%; 95% CI, 3.8%-16.6%), and 5.5% (47.7% vs 53.2%; 95% CI, 1.9%-9.1%) fewer persons, respectively, had completed high school and 7.9% (29.3% vs 37.2%; 95% CI, 1.6%-14.2%), 8.9% (28.1% vs 37.0%; 95% CI, 0.6%-17.2%), and 6.5% (33.5% vs 40.0%; 95% CI, 1.4%-11.6%) fewer had attained a higher education compared with individuals from the comparison cohort. Siblings of meningococcal meningitis patients also had lower educational achievements, while educational achievements of siblings of pneumococcal and H. influenzae meningitis patients did not differ substantially from those in the general population. At end of follow-up, 3.8% (90.3% vs 94.1%; 95% CI, 1.1%-6.5%), 10.6% (84.0% vs 94.6%; 95% CI, 5.1%-16.1%), and 4.3% (90.6% vs 94.9%; 95% CI, 2.0%-6.6%) fewer meningococcal, pneumococcal, and H. influenzae meningitis patients were economically self-sufficient and 1.5% (3.7% vs 2.3%; 95% CI, -0.2% to 3.2%), 8.7% (10.0% vs 1.3%; 95% CI, 5.0%-12.4%), and 3.7% (6.2% vs 2.5%; 95% CI, 1.6%-5.8%) more received disability pension compared with individuals from the comparison cohort. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a Danish population, bacterial meningitis in childhood was associated with lower educational achievement and economic self-sufficiency in adult life. This association may apply particularly to pneumococcal and H. influenzae meningitis, whereas for meningococcal meningitis the lower educational achievement may be family-related.","Adult Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Denmark/epidemiology Disabled Persons *Educational Status Family Relations Female Humans Income Male Meningitis, Haemophilus/*physiopathology Meningitis, Meningococcal/*physiopathology Meningitis, Pneumococcal/*physiopathology Registries/statistics & numerical data Siblings *Social Class Survivors"

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between peripregnancy consumption of P/TN by mothers and the risk of P/TN allergy in their offspring. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study. The 10,907 participants in the Growing Up Today Study 2, born between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1994, are the offspring of women who previously reported their diet during, or shortly before or after, their pregnancy with this child as part of the ongoing Nurses' Health Study II. In 2006, the offspring reported physician-diagnosed food allergy. Mothers were asked to confirm the diagnosis and to provide available medical records and allergy test results. Two board-certified pediatricians, including a board-certified allergist/immunologist, independently reviewed each potential case and assigned a confirmation code (eg, likely food allergy) to each case. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate associations between peripregnancy consumption of P/TN by mothers and incident P/TN allergy in their offspring. EXPOSURE: Peripregnancy consumption of P/TN. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Physician-diagnosed P/TN allergy in offspring. RESULTS: Among 8205 children, we identified 308 cases of food allergy (any food), including 140 cases of P/TN allergy. The incidence of P/TN allergy in the offspring was significantly lower among children of the 8059 nonallergic mothers who consumed more P/TN in their peripregnancy diet (>/= 5 times vs <1 time per month: odds ratio = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.13-0.75; P(trend) = .004). By contrast, a nonsignificant positive association was observed between maternal peripregnancy P/TN consumption and risk of P/TN allergy in the offspring of 146 P/TN-allergic mothers (P(trend) = .12). The interaction between maternal peripregnancy P/TN consumption and maternal P/TN allergy status was statistically significant (P(interaction) = .004). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among mothers without P/TN allergy, higher peripregnancy consumption of P/TN was associated with lower risk of P/TN allergy in their offspring.

24615283,Hours of television viewing and sleep duration in children: a multicenter birth cohort study.,JAMA Pediatr,Marinelli M and Sunyer J and Alvarez-Pedrerol M and Iniguez C and Torrent M and Vioque J and Turner MC and Julvez J,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: This study used longitudinal data to examine potential associations between hours of television viewing and sleep duration in children. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between hours of television viewing and sleep duration in preschool and school-aged children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal, multicenter study among birth cohorts in Menorca, Sabadell, and Valencia from the Spanish Infancia y Medio Ambiente (environment and childhood) project. The study sample included 1713 children (468 from Menorca, 560 from Sabadell, and 685 from Valencia). EXPOSURE: Parent-reported child television viewing duration measured in hours per day at 2 and 4 years of age in Sabadell and Valencia and at 6 and 9 years of age in Menorca. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Parent-reported child sleep duration measured in hours per day at 2 and 4 years of age in Sabadell and Valencia and at 6 and 9 years of age in Menorca. RESULTS: In cross-sectional analysis, children with longer periods of television viewing reported at baseline (>/= 1.5 hours per day) had shorter sleep duration. Longitudinally, children with reported increases in television viewing duration over time (from <1.5 to >/= 1.5 hours per day) had a reduction in sleep duration at follow-up visits. Results were similar when examining television viewing duration as a continuous variable, with each 1 hour per day of increased viewing decreasing sleep duration at follow-up visits (beta = -0.11; 95% CI, -0.18 to -0.05). Associations were similar when television viewing duration was assessed during weekends and after adjusting for potential intermediate factors (child executive function and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms) and confounders (child physical activity level, parental mental health status, maternal IQ, and maternal marital status). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children spending longer periods watching television had shorter sleep duration. Changes in television viewing duration were inversely associated with changes in sleep duration in longitudinal analysis. Parents should consider avoiding long periods of daily television exposure among preschool and school-aged children.","Child Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Female Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Risk Factors *Sleep Spain Television/*statistics & numerical data Time Factors"

Despite these advances, reduced access to auditory experience may have downstream effects on fundamental neurocognitive processes for some children with CIs. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative risk (RR) of clinically significant executive functioning deficits in children with CIs compared with children with normal hearing (NH). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this prospective, cross-sectional study, 73 children at a hospital-based clinic who received their CIs before 7 years of age and 78 children with NH, with average to above average mean nonverbal IQ scores, were recruited in 2 age groups: preschool age (age range, 3-5 years) and school age (age range, 7-17 years). No children presented with other developmental, cognitive, or neurologic diagnoses. INTERVENTIONS: Parent-reported checklist measures of executive functioning were completed during psychological testing sessions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimates of the RR of clinically significant deficits in executive functioning (>/=1 SDs above the mean) for children with CIs compared with children with NH were obtained based on 2 parent-reported child behavior checklists of everyday problems with executive functioning. RESULTS: In most domains of executive functioning, children with CIs were at 2 to 5 times greater risk of clinically significant deficits compared with children with NH. The RRs for preschoolers and school-aged children, respectively, were greatest in the areas of comprehension and conceptual learning (RR [95% CI], 3.56 [1.71-7.43] and 6.25 [2.64-14.77]), factual memory ( 4.88 [1.58-15.07] and 5.47 [2.03-14.77]), attention (3.38 [1.03-11.04] and 3.13 [1.56-6.26]), sequential processing (11.25 [1.55-81.54] and 2.44 [1.24-4.76]), working memory (4.13 [1.30-13.06] and 3.64 [1.61-8.25] for one checklist and 1.77 [0.82-3.83] and 2.78 [1.18-6.51] for another checklist), and novel problem-solving (3.93 [1.50-10.34] and 3.13 [1.46-6.67]). No difference between the CI and NH samples was found for visual-spatial organization (2.63 [0.76-9.03] and 1.04 [0.45-2.40] on one checklist and 2.86 [0.98-8.39] for school-aged children on the other checklist). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A large proportion of children with CIs are at risk for clinically significant deficits across multiple domains of executive functioning, a rate averaging 2 to 5 times that of children with NH for most domains. Screening for risk of executive functioning deficits should be a routine part of the clinical evaluation of all children with deafness and CIs.","Adolescent Age Factors Child Child, Preschool *Cochlear Implants Cross-Sectional Studies Deafness/physiopathology Executive Function/*physiology Female Humans Male Prospective Studies Risk"

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, cross-sectional study of 409 psoriatic children. Psoriasis was classified as mild (worst Physician's Global Assessment score </=3 with body surface area </=10%) or severe (worst Physician's Global Assessment score >/=3 with body surface area >10%). Children were enrolled from 9 countries between June 19, 2009, and December 2, 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Excess adiposity (body mass index percentile) and central adiposity (waist circumference percentile and waist to height ratio). RESULTS: Excess adiposity (body mass index >/=85th percentile) occurred in 37.9% of psoriatic children (n=155) vs 20.5% of controls (n=42) but did not differ significantly by severity. The odds ratio (95% CI) of obesity (body mass index >/=95th percentile) overall in psoriatic children vs controls was 4.29 (1.96-9.39) and was higher with severe (4.92; 2.20-10.99) than with mild (3.60; 1.56-8.30) psoriasis, particularly in the United States (7.60; 2.47-23.34, and 4.72; 1.43-15.56, respectively). Waist circumference above the 90th percentile occurred in 9.3% of the control (n=19), 14.0% of the mild psoriasis (n=27), and 21.2% of the of severe psoriasis (n=43) participants internationally; this incidence was highest in the United States (12.0% [n=13], 20.8% [16], and 31.1% [32], respectively). Waist to height ratio was significantly higher in psoriatic (0.48) vs control (0.46) children but was unaffected by psoriasis severity. Children with severe psoriasis at its worst, but mild at enrollment, showed no significant difference in excess or central adiposity from children whose psoriasis remained severe. CONCLUSIONS: Globally, children with psoriasis have excess adiposity and increased central adiposity regardless of psoriasis severity. The increased metabolic risks associated with excess and central adiposity warrant early monitoring and lifestyle modification.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk of type 2 diabetes in children and youth 6 to 24 years of age for recent initiators of antipsychotic drugs vs propensity score-matched controls who had recently initiated another psychotropic medication. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of the Tennessee Medicaid program with 28 858 recent initiators of antipsychotic drugs and 14 429 matched controls. The cohort excluded patients who previously received a diagnosis of diabetes, schizophrenia, or some other condition for which antipsychotics are the only generally recognized therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Newly diagnosed diabetes during follow-up, as identified from diagnoses and diabetes medication prescriptions. RESULTS: Users of antipsychotics had a 3-fold increased risk for type 2 diabetes (HR = 3.03 [95% CI = 1.73-5.32]), which was apparent within the first year of follow-up (HR = 2.49 [95% CI = 1.27-4.88]). The risk increased with cumulative dose during follow-up, with HRs of 2.13 (95% CI = 1.06-4.27), 3.42 (95% CI = 1.88-6.24), and 5.43 (95% CI = 2.34-12.61) for respective cumulative doses (gram equivalents of chlorpromazine) of more than 5 g, 5 to 99 g, and 100 g or more (P < .04). The risk remained elevated for up to 1 year following discontinuation of antipsychotic use (HR = 2.57 [95% CI = 1.34-4.91]). When the cohort was restricted to children 6 to 17 years of age, antipsychotic users had more than a 3-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes (HR = 3.14 [95% CI = 1.50-6.56]), and the risk increased significantly with increasing cumulative dose (P < .03). The risk was increased for use restricted to atypical antipsychotics (HR = 2.89 [95% CI = 1.64-5.10]) or to risperidone (HR = 2.20 [95% CI = 1.14-4.26]).

The prevalence of lipid-lowering medication use increased from 3.4% (95% CI, 2.9%-3.9%) in 1988-1994 to 15.5% (95% CI, 14.7%-16.3%) in 2007-2010 (P <.001 for linear trend). Among adults not receiving lipid-lowering medications, trends in lipids were similar to those reported for adults overall. Among obese adults, mean TC, non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and geometric mean triglycerides declined between 1988 and 2010. CONCLUSION: Between 1988 and 2010, favorable trends in lipid levels have occurred among adults in the United States.","Adult Aged Cholesterol, HDL/*blood Cholesterol, LDL/*blood Cross-Sectional Studies Female Humans Hyperlipidemias/drug therapy/*epidemiology Hypolipidemic Agents/therapeutic use Male Middle Aged Nutrition Surveys Obesity/blood Prevalence Triglycerides/*blood United States/epidemiology"
23403843,Association of parental chronic pain with chronic pain in the adolescent and young adult: family linkage data from the HUNT Study.,JAMA Pediatr,Hoftun GB and Romundstad PR and Rygg M,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To examine a possible association of parental chronic pain with chronic pain in the adolescent and young adult and to explore whether a relationship could be explained by socioeconomic and psychosocial factors or may be affected by differences in family structure. DESIGN: Unselected, population-based, cross-sectional study. SETTING: Nord-Trondelag County, Norway. PARTICIPANTS: All inhabitants of Nord-Trondelag County who were 13 years or older were invited to enroll in the study. In total, 8200 of 10 485 invitees (78.2%) participated in the investigation. Among 7913 participants in the target age group (age range, 13-18 years), 7373 (93.2%) completed the pain questions. The final study population consisted of 5370 adolescents or young adults for whom one or both parents participated in the adult survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was chronic nonspecific pain in adolescents and young adults, defined as pain in at least 1 location, unrelated to any known disease or injury, experienced at least once a week during the past 3 months. Chronic multisite pain was defined as chronic pain in at least 3 locations. RESULTS: Maternal chronic pain was associated with chronic nonspecific pain and chronic multisite pain in adolescents and young adults (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.8). Paternal chronic pain was associated with increased odds of pain in adolescents and young adults. The odds of chronic nonspecific pain and chronic multisite pain in adolescents and young adults increased when both parents reported pain. Adjustments for socioeconomic and psychosocial factors did not change the results, although differences in family structure did. Among offspring living primarily with their mothers, clear associations were observed between maternal pain and pain in adolescents and young adults, but no association was found with paternal pain. CONCLUSIONS: Parental chronic pain is associated with chronic nonspecific pain and especially with chronic multisite pain in adolescents and young adults. Family structure influences the relationship, indicating that family pain models and shared environmental factors are important in the origin of chronic pain.",Adolescent Adult Chronic Pain/economics/*etiology/psychology Cross-Sectional Studies Family/psychology Female Health Surveys Humans Logistic Models Male Multivariate Analysis Norway Odds Ratio *Parents/psychology Psychology Questionnaires Risk Factors Socioeconomic Factors Young Adult
23168823,Effect of citicoline on functional and cognitive status among patients with traumatic brain injury: Citicoline Brain Injury Treatment Trial (COBRIT).,JAMA,Zafonte RD and Bagiella E and Ansel BM and Novack TA and Friedewald WT and Hesdorffer DC and Timmons SD and Jallo J and Eisenberg H and Hart T and Ricker JH and Diaz-Arrastia R and Merchant RE and Temkin NR and Melton S and Dikmen SS,partners,"CONTEXT: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States, yet no treatment is currently available to improve outcome after TBI. Approved for use in TBI in 59 countries, citicoline is an endogenous substance offering potential neuroprotective properties as well as facilitated neurorepair post injury. OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of citicoline to positively affect functional and cognitive status in persons with complicated mild, moderate, and severe TBI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The Citicoline Brain Injury Treatment Trial (COBRIT), a phase 3, double-blind randomized clinical trial conducted between July 20, 2007, and February 4, 2011, among 1213 patients at 8 US level 1 trauma centers to investigate effects of citicoline vs placebo in patients with TBI classified as complicated mild, moderate, or severe. INTERVENTION: Ninety-day regimen of daily enteral or oral citicoline (2000 mg) or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Functional and cognitive status, assessed at 90 days using the TBI-Clinical Trials Network Core Battery. A global statistical test was used to analyze the 9 scales of the core battery. Secondary outcomes were functional and cognitive improvement, assessed at 30, 90, and 180 days, and examination of the long-term maintenance of treatment effects. RESULTS: Rates of favorable improvement for the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended were 35.4% in the citicoline group and 35.6% in the placebo group. For all other scales the rate of improvement ranged from 37.3% to 86.5% in the citicoline group and from 42.7% to 84.0% in the placebo group. The citicoline and placebo groups did not differ significantly at the 90-day evaluation (global odds ratio [OR], 0.98 [95% CI, 0.83-1.15]); in addition, there was no significant treatment effect in the 2 severity subgroups (global OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.88-1.49] and 0.89 [95% CI, 0.72-1.49] for moderate/severe and complicated mild TBI, respectively). At the 180-day evaluation, the citicoline and placebo groups did not differ significantly with respect to the primary outcome (global OR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.72-1.04]). CONCLUSION: Among patients with traumatic brain injury, the use of citicoline compared with placebo for 90 days did not result in improvement in functional and cognitive status.

Prime Time, a youth development intervention, aims to reduce pregnancy risk among adolescent girls seeking clinic services who are at high risk for pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sexual risk behaviors and related outcomes with a 24-month postbaseline survey, 6 months after the conclusion of the Prime Time intervention. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Community and school-based primary care clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Of 253 sexually active 13- to 17-year-old girls meeting specified risk criteria, 236 (93.3%) completed the 24-month follow-up survey. INTERVENTION: Offered during an 18-month period, Prime Time includes case management and youth leadership programs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported consistency of condom, hormonal, and dual-method contraceptive use with most recent male sex partner and number of male sex partners in the past 6 months. RESULTS: At 24-month follow-up, the intervention group reported significantly more consistent use of condoms, hormonal contraception, and dual-method contraception than the control group. Intervention participants also reported improvements in family connectedness and self-efficacy to refuse unwanted sex, and reductions in the perceived importance of having sex. No between-group differences were found in the number of recent male sex partners. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study contributes to what has been a dearth of evidence regarding youth development interventions offered through clinic settings, where access to high-risk adolescents is plentiful but few efforts have emphasized a dual approach of strengthening sexual and nonsexual protective factors while addressing risk. Findings suggest that health services grounded in a youth development framework can lead to long-term reductions in sexual risk among vulnerable youth.",Adolescent Female Humans Intention to Treat Analysis Leadership Peer Group Pregnancy Pregnancy in Adolescence/*prevention & control Risk-Taking Sexual Behavior Trust

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, following brief stabilization with a combination of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate, the relative efficacy of 1-, 2-, and 4-week buprenorphine tapering regimens and subsequent naltrexone hydrochloride therapy in PO-dependent outpatients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A double-blind, 12-week randomized clinical trial was conducted in an outpatient research clinic. Following a brief period of buprenorphine stabilization, 70 PO-dependent adults were randomized to receive 1-, 2-, or 4-week tapers followed by naltrexone therapy. INTERVENTION: During phase 1 (weeks 1-5 after randomization), participants visited the clinic daily; during phase 2 (weeks 6-12), visits were reduced to thrice weekly. Participants received behavioral therapy and urine toxicology testing throughout the trial. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The percentage of participants negative for illicit opioid use, retention, naltrexone ingestion, and favorable treatment response (ie, retained in treatment, opioid abstinent, and receiving naltrexone at the end of the study). RESULTS: Opioid abstinence at the end of phase 1 was greater in the 4-week compared with the 2- and 1-week taper conditions (P = .02), with 63% (n = 14), 29% (n = 7), and 29% (n = 7) of participants abstinent in the 4-, 2-, and 1-week conditions, respectively. Abstinence at the end of phase 2 was also greater in the 4-week compared with the 2- and 1-week conditions (P = .03), with 50% (n = 11), 16% (n = 4), and 20% (n = 5) of participants abstinent in the 4-, 2-, and 1-week conditions, respectively. There were more treatment responders in the 4-week condition (P = .03), with 50% (n = 11), 17% (n = 4), and 21% (n = 5) of participants in the 4-, 2-, and 1-week groups considered responders at the end of treatment, respectively. Retention and naltrexone ingestion also were superior in the 4-week vs briefer tapers (both P = .04). Experimental condition (ie, taper duration) was the strongest predictor of treatment response, followed by buprenorphine stabilization dose. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study represents a rigorous experimental evaluation of outpatient buprenorphine stabilization, brief taper, and naltrexone maintenance for treatment of PO dependence. Results suggest that a meaningful subset of PO-dependent outpatients may respond positively to a 4-week taper plus naltrexone maintenance intervention.",Adult Buprenorphine/*administration & dosage/pharmacology Cognitive Therapy/methods Combined Modality Therapy Double-Blind Method Drug Administration Schedule Female Humans Male Naloxone/therapeutic use Naltrexone/therapeutic use Narcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage/pharmacology Opiate Substitution Treatment/*methods Opioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/psychology/urine Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Severity of Illness Index Time Factors Treatment Outcome Young Adult
23370902,Randomized clinical trial evaluating intravitreal ranibizumab or saline for vitreous hemorrhage from proliferative diabetic retinopathy.,JAMA Ophthalmol,Missing,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Vascular endothelial growth factor plays a role in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Intravitreal injection of saline has been shown potentially to lead to improved visual acuity compared with observation alone in eyes with vitreous hemorrhage. Therefore, it is important to determine if intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor can reduce vitrectomy rates (and risks associated with vitrectomy) compared with saline for vitreous hemorrhage from PDR that precludes placement or confirmation of complete panretinal photocoagulation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate intravitreal ranibizumab compared with intravitreal saline injections on vitrectomy rates for vitreous hemorrhage from PDR. DESIGN: Phase 3, double-masked, randomized, multicenter clinical trial. Data reported were collected from June 2010 to March 2012 and include 16 weeks of follow-up. SETTING: Community-based and academic-based ophthalmology practices specializing in retinal diseases. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred sixty-one eyes of 261 study participants, who were at least 18 years of age with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Study eyes had vitreous hemorrhage from PDR precluding panretinal photocoagulation completion. INTERVENTION: Eyes were randomly assigned to 0.5-mg intravitreal ranibizumab (n = 125) or intravitreal saline (n = 136) at baseline and 4 and 8 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cumulative probability of vitrectomy within 16 weeks. RESULTS: Cumulative probability of vitrectomy by 16 weeks was 12% with ranibizumab vs 17% with saline (difference, 4%; 95% CI, -4% to 13%) and of complete panretinal photocoagulation without vitrectomy by 16 weeks was 44% and 31%, respectively (P = .05). The mean (SD) visual acuity improvement from baseline to 12 weeks was 22 (23) letters and 16 (31) letters, respectively (P = .04). Recurrent vitreous hemorrhage occurred within 16 weeks in 6% and 17%, respectively (P = .01). One eye developed endophthalmitis after saline injection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Overall, the 16-week vitrectomy rates were lower than expected in both groups. This study suggests little likelihood of a clinically important difference between ranibizumab and saline on the rate of vitrectomy by 16 weeks in eyes with vitreous hemorrhage from PDR. Short-term secondary outcomes including visual acuity improvement, increased panretinal photocoagulation completion rates, and reduced recurrent vitreous hemorrhage rates suggest biologic activity of ranibizumab. Long-term benefits remain unknown. Whether vitrectomy rates after saline or ranibizumab injection are different than observation alone cannot be determined from this study.

25250737,Treatment of Complicated Grief in Elderly Persons: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,JAMA Psychiatry,Shear MK and Wang Y and Skritskaya N and Duan N and Mauro C and Ghesquiere A,Missing,"Importance: Complicated grief (CG) is a debilitating condition, most prevalent in elderly persons. However, to our knowledge, no full-scale randomized clinical trial has studied CG in this population. Objective: To determine whether complicated grief treatment (CGT) produces greater improvement in CG and depressive symptoms than grief-focused interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized clinical trial enrolling 151 individuals 50 years or older (mean [SD] age, 66.1 [8.9] years) scoring at least 30 on the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG). Participants were recruited from the New York metropolitan area from August 20, 2008, through January 7, 2013, and randomized to receive CGT or IPT. The main outcome was assessed at 20 weeks after baseline, with interim measures collected at 8, 12, and 16 weeks after baseline. Interventions: Sixteen sessions of CGT (n = 74) or IPT (n = 77) delivered approximately weekly. Main Outcomes and Measures: Rate of treatment response, defined as a rating from an independent evaluator of much or very much improved on the Improvement subscale of the Clinical Global Impression Scale. Results: Both treatments produced improvement in CG symptoms. Response rate for CGT (52 individuals [70.5%]) was more than twice that for IPT (24 [32.0%]) (relative risk, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.51-3.22]; P < .001), with the number needed to treat at 2.56. Secondary analyses of CG severity and CG symptom and impairment questionnaire measures confirmed that CGT conferred a significantly greater change in illness severity (22 individuals [35.2%] in the CGT group vs 41 [64.1%] in the IPT group were still at least moderately ill [P = .001]), rate of CG symptom reduction (1.05 ICG points per week for CGT vs 0.75 points per week for IPT [t633 = 3.85; P < .001]), and the rate of improvement in CG impairment (0.63 work and Social Adjustment Scale points per week with CGT and 0.39 points per week with IPT [t503 = 2.87; P = .004]). Results were not moderated by participant age. Conclusions and Relevance: Complicated grief treatment produced clinically and statistically significantly greater response rates for CG symptoms than a proven efficacious treatment for depression (IPT). Results strongly support the need for physicians and other health care providers to distinguish CG from depression. Given the growing elderly population, the high prevalence of bereavement in aging individuals, and the marked physical and psychological impact of CG, clinicians need to know how to treat CG in older adults.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of family-centered ACP. DESIGN AND SETTING: Two-group randomized controlled trial in a pediatric oncology program. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty adolescents aged 14 to 21 years with cancer and their surrogates or families were enrolled in the study between January 17, 2011, and March 29, 2012. INTERVENTION: Thirty dyads received 3- to 60-minute sessions 1 week apart. Intervention dyads completed (1) the Lyon Family-Centered ACP Survey, (2) the Respecting Choices interview, and (3) Five Wishes. Control subjects received standard care plus information. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Statement of treatment preferences and Decisional Conflict Scale score. RESULTS: The mean age of the adolescents was 16 years; 36 (60%) were male, 30 (50%) white, 26 (43%) black, and 4 (7%) Asian. Diagnoses were as follows: leukemia (14 patients [47%]), brain tumor (8 [27%]), solid tumor (6 [20%]), and lymphoma (2 [7%]). Significantly increased congruence was observed for intervention dyads compared with controls for 4 of the 6 disease-specific scenarios; for example, for situation 2 (""treatment would extend my life by not more than 2 to 3 months""), intervention dyads demonstrated higher congruence (kappa = 0.660; P < .001) vs control dyads (kappa = -0.0636; P = .70). Intervention adolescents (100%) wanted their families to do what is best at the time, whereas fewer control adolescents (62%) gave families this leeway. Intervention adolescents were significantly better informed about end-of-life decisions (t = 2.93; effect size, 0.961; 95% CI, 0.742-1.180; P = .007). Intervention families were more likely to concur on limiting treatments than controls. An ethnic difference was found in only one situation.

23319069,A cluster randomized trial of decision support strategies for reducing antibiotic use in acute bronchitis.,JAMA Intern Med,Gonzales R and Anderer T and McCulloch CE and Maselli JH and Bloom FJ Jr and Graf TR and Stahl M and Yefko M and Molecavage J and Metlay JP,ucsf,"BACKGROUND: National quality indicators show little change in the overuse of antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bronchitis. We compared the effect of 2 decision support strategies on antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis. METHODS: We conducted a 3-arm cluster randomized trial among 33 primary care practices belonging to an integrated health care system in central Pennsylvania. The printed decision support intervention sites (11 practices) received decision support for acute cough illness through a print-based strategy, the computer-assisted decision support intervention sites (11 practices) received decision support through an electronic medical record-based strategy, and the control sites (11 practices) served as a control arm. Both intervention sites also received clinician education and feedback on prescribing practices, as well as patient education brochures at check-in. Antibiotic prescription rates for uncomplicated acute bronchitis in the winter period (October 1, 2009, through March 31, 2010) following introduction of the intervention were compared with the previous 3 winter periods in an intent-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: Compared with the baseline period, the percentage of adolescents and adults prescribed antibiotics during the intervention period decreased at the printed decision support intervention sites (from 80.0% to 68.3%) and at the computer-assisted decision support intervention sites (from 74.0% to 60.7%) but increased slightly at the control sites (from 72.5% to 74.3%). After controlling for patient and clinician characteristics, as well as clustering of observations by clinician and practice site, the differences for the intervention sites were statistically significant from the control sites (P = .003 for control sites vs printed decision support intervention sites and P = .01 for control sites vs computer-assisted decision support intervention sites) but not between themselves (P = .67 for printed decision support intervention sites vs computer-assisted decision support intervention sites). Changes in total visits, 30-day return visit rates, and proportion diagnosed as having uncomplicated acute bronchitis were similar among the study sites. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a decision support strategy for acute bronchitis can help reduce the overuse of antibiotics in primary care settings. The effect of printed vs computer-assisted decision support strategies for providing decision support was equivalent.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of a fluid-restricted (maximum fluid intake, 800 mL/d) and sodium-restricted (maximum dietary intake, 800 mg/d) diet (intervention group [IG]) vs a diet with no such restrictions (control group [CG]) on weight loss and clinical stability during a 3-day period in patients hospitalized with ADHF. DESIGN: Randomized, parallel-group clinical trial with blinded outcome assessments. SETTING: Emergency room, wards, and intensive care unit. PARTICIPANTS: Adult inpatients with ADHF, systolic dysfunction, and a length of stay of 36 hours or less. INTERVENTION: Fluid restriction (maximum fluid intake, 800 mL/d) and additional sodium restriction (maximum dietary intake, 800 mg/d) were carried out until the seventh hospital day or, in patients whose length of stay was less than 7 days, until discharge. The CG received a standard hospital diet, with liberal fluid and sodium intake. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Weight loss and clinical stability at 3-day assessment, daily perception of thirst, and readmissions within 30 days. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were enrolled (IG, 38; CG, 37). Most were male; ischemic heart disease was the predominant cause of heart failure (17 patients [23%]), and the mean (SD) left ventricular ejection fraction was 26% (8.7%). The groups were homogeneous in terms of baseline characteristics. Weight loss was similar in both groups (between-group difference in variation of 0.25 kg [95% CI, -1.95 to 2.45]; P = .82) as well as change in clinical congestion score (between-group difference in variation of 0.59 points [95% CI, -2.21 to 1.03]; P = .47) at 3 days. Thirst was significantly worse in the IG (5.1 [2.9]) than the CG (3.44 [2.0]) at the end of the study period (between-group difference, 1.66 points; time x group interaction; P = .01). There were no significant between-group differences in the readmission rate at 30 days (IG, 11 patients [29%]; CG, 7 patients [19%]; P = .41). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Aggressive fluid and sodium restriction has no effect on weight loss or clinical stability at 3 days and is associated with a significant increase in perceived thirst. We conclude that sodium and water restriction in patients admitted for ADHF are unnecessary.

Physical or mental activity alone result in relatively small, domain-specific improvements in cognitive function in older adults; combined interventions may have more global effects. OBJECTIVE: To examine the combined effects of physical plus mental activity on cognitive function in older adults. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with a factorial design. SETTING: San Francisco, California. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 126 inactive, community-residing older adults with cognitive complaints. INTERVENTIONS: All participants engaged in home-based mental activity (1 h/d, 3 d/wk) plus class-based physical activity (1 h/d, 3 d/wk) for 12 weeks and were randomized to either mental activity intervention (MA-I; intensive computer) or mental activity control (MA-C; educational DVDs) plus exercise intervention (EX-I; aerobic) or exercise control (EX-C; stretching and toning); a 2 x 2 factorial design was used so that there were 4 groups: MA-I/EX-I, MA-I/EX-C, MA-C/EX-1, and MA-C/EX-C. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Global cognitive change based on a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 73.4 years; 62.7% were women, and 34.9% were Hispanic or nonwhite. There were no significant differences between the groups at baseline. Global cognitive scores improved significantly over time (mean, 0.16 SD; P < .001) but did not differ between groups in the comparison between MA-I and MA-C (ignoring exercise, P = .17), the comparison between EX-I and EX-C (ignoring mental activity, P = .74), or across all 4 randomization groups (P = .26). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In inactive older adults with cognitive complaints, 12 weeks of physical plus mental activity was associated with significant improvements in global cognitive function with no evidence of difference between intervention and active control groups. These findings may reflect practice effects or may suggest that the amount of activity is more important than the type in this subject population.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated underwear provides effective long-term protection against body lice in homeless persons. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in February and December 2011 in 2 homeless shelters (Madrague Ville and Forbin) in Marseille, France. Of the 125 homeless persons screened for eligibility, 73 body lice-infested homeless persons, 18 years or older, were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Body lice-infested homeless persons were randomly assigned to receive 0.4% permethrin-impregnated underwear or an identical-appearing placebo for 45 days, in a 1:1 ratio, with a permuted block size of 10. Visits were scheduled at days 14 and 45. Data regarding the presence or absence of live body lice were collected. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary and secondary end points were the proportions of homeless persons free of body lice on days 14 and 45, respectively. Mutations associated with permethrin resistance in the body lice were also identified. RESULTS: Significantly more homeless persons receiving permethrin-impregnated underwear than homeless persons receiving the placebo were free of body lice on day 14 in the intent-to-treat population (28% vs 9%; P = .04), with a between-group difference of 18.4 percentage points (95% CI, 1.4-35.4), and in the per-protocol population (34% vs 11%; P = .03), with a between-group difference of 23.7 percentage points (95% CI, 3.6-43.7). This difference was not sustained on day 45. At baseline, the prevalence of the permethrin-resistant haplotype was 51% in the permethrin group and 44% in the placebo group. On day 45, the permethrin-resistant haplotype was significantly more frequent in the permethrin group than in the placebo group (73% vs 45%, P < .001). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Permethrin-impregnated underwear is more efficient than placebo at eliminating body louse infestations by day 14; however, this difference was not sustained on day 45. The use of permethrin may have increased the resistance to permethrin in body lice and thus must be avoided.

23212499,Effectiveness of a clinically integrated e-learning course in evidence-based medicine for reproductive health training: a randomized trial.,JAMA,Kulier R and Gulmezoglu AM and Zamora J and Plana MN and Carroli G and Cecatti JG and Germar MJ and Pisake L and Mittal S and Pattinson R and Wolomby-Molondo JJ and Bergh AM and May W and Souza JP and Koppenhoefer S and Khan KS,Missing,"CONTEXT: For evidence-based practice to embed culturally in the workplace, teaching of evidence-based medicine (EBM) should be clinically integrated. In low-middle-income countries (LMICs) there is a scarcity of EBM-trained clinical tutors, lack of protected time for teaching EBM, and poor access to relevant databases in languages other than English. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a clinically integrated e-learning EBM course incorporating the World Health Organization (WHO) Reproductive Health Library (RHL) on knowledge, skills, and educational environment compared with traditional EBM teaching. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: International cluster randomized trial conducted between April 2009 and November 2010 among postgraduate trainees in obstetrics-gynecology in 7 LMICs (Argentina, Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand). Each training unit was randomized to an experimental clinically integrated course consisting of e-modules using the RHL for learning activities and trainee assessments (31 clusters, 123 participants) or to a control self-directed EBM course incorporating the RHL (29 clusters, 81 participants). A facilitator with EBM teaching experience was available at all teaching units. Courses were administered for 8 weeks, with assessments at baseline and 4 weeks after course completion. The study was completed in 24 experimental clusters (98 participants) and 22 control clusters (68 participants). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were change in EBM knowledge (score range, 0-62) and skills (score range, 0-14). Secondary outcome was educational environment (5-point Likert scale anchored between 1 [strongly agree] and 5 [strongly disagree]). RESULTS: At baseline, the study groups were similar in age, year of training, and EBM-related attitudes and knowledge. After the trial, the experimental group had higher mean scores in knowledge (38.1 [95% CI, 36.7 to 39.4] in the control group vs 43.1 [95% CI, 42.0 to 44.1] in the experimental group; adjusted difference, 4.9 [95% CI, 2.9 to 6.8]; P < .001) and skills (8.3 [95% CI, 7.9 to 8.7] vs 9.1 [95% CI, 8.7 to 9.4]; adjusted difference, 0.7 [95% CI, 0.1 to 1.3]; P = .02). Although there was no difference in improvement for the overall score for educational environment (6.0 [95% CI, -0.1 to 12.0] vs 13.6 [95% CI, 8.0 to 19.2]; adjusted difference, 9.6 [95% CI, -6.8 to 26.1]; P = .25), there was an associated mean improvement in the domains of general relationships and support (-0.5 [95% CI, -1.5 to 0.4] vs 0.3 [95% CI, -0.6 to 1.1]; adjusted difference, 2.3 [95% CI, 0.2 to 4.3]; P = .03) and EBM application opportunities (0.5 [95% CI, -0.7 to 1.8] vs 2.9 [95%, CI, 1.8 to 4.1]; adjusted difference, 3.3 [95% CI, 0.1 to 6.5]; P = .04). CONCLUSION: In a group of LMICs, a clinically integrated e-learning EBM curriculum in reproductive health compared with a self-directed EBM course resulted in higher knowledge and skill scores and improved educational environment.

24005242,Prevention of depression in at-risk adolescents: longer-term effects.,JAMA Psychiatry,Beardslee WR and Brent DA and Weersing VR and Clarke GN and Porta G and Hollon SD and Gladstone TR and Gallop R and Lynch FL and Iyengar S and DeBar L and Garber J,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Adolescent offspring of depressed parents are at high risk for experiencing depressive disorders themselves. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the positive effects of a group cognitive-behavioral prevention (CBP) program extended to longer-term (multiyear) follow-up. DESIGN: A 4-site randomized clinical trial with 33 months of follow-up was conducted. Recruitment of participants was from August 2003 through February 2006. SETTING: The study settings included a health maintenance organization, university medical centers, and a community mental health center. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred sixteen adolescent (aged 13-17 years) offspring of parents with current and/or prior depressive disorders; adolescents had histories of depression, current elevated depressive symptoms, or both but did not currently meet criteria for a depressive disorder. INTERVENTIONS: The CBP program consisted of 8 weekly 90-minute group sessions followed by 6 monthly continuation sessions. Adolescents were randomly assigned to either the CBP program or usual care (UC). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a probable or definite episode of depression (Depression Symptom Rating score >/=4) for at least 2 weeks through the month 33 follow-up evaluation. RESULTS: Over the 33-month follow-up period, youths in the CBP condition had significantly fewer onsets of depressive episodes compared with those in UC. Parental depression at baseline significantly moderated the intervention effect. When parents were not depressed at intake, CBP was superior to UC (number needed to treat, 6), whereas when parents were actively depressed at baseline, average onset rates between CBP and UC were not significantly different. A 3-way interaction among intervention, baseline parental depression, and site indicated that the impact of parental depression on intervention effectiveness varied across sites. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The CBP program showed significant sustained effects compared with UC in preventing the onset of depressive episodes in at-risk youth over a nearly 3-year period. Important next steps will be to strengthen the CBP intervention to further enhance its preventive effects, improve intervention outcomes when parents are currently depressed, and conduct larger implementation trials to test the broader public health impact of the CBP program for preventing depression in youth.

DESIGN We compared former NFL players with cognitive impairment and depression, cognitively normal retired players who were not depressed, and matched healthy control subjects. SETTING Research center in the North Texas region of the United States. PATIENTS Cross-sectional sample of former NFL players with and without a history of concussion recruited from the North Texas region and age-, education-, and IQ-matched controls. Thirty-four retired NFL players (mean age, 61.8 years) underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessment. A subset of 26 players also underwent detailed neuroimaging; imaging data in this subset were compared with imaging data acquired in 26 healthy matched controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Neuropsychological measures, clinical diagnoses of depression, neuroimaging mea-sures of white matter pathology, and a measure of cerebral blood flow. RESULTS Of the 34 former NFL players, 20 were cognitively normal. Four were diagnosed as having a fixed cognitive deficit; 8, mild cognitive impairment; 2, dementia; and 8, depression. Of the subgroup in whom neuroimaging data were acquired, cognitively impaired participants showed the greatest deficits on tests of naming, word finding, and visual/verbal episodic memory. We found significant differences in white matter abnormalities in cognitively impaired and depressed retired players compared with their respective controls. Regional blood flow differences in the cognitively impaired group (left temporal pole, inferior parietal lobule, and superior temporal gyrus) corresponded to regions associated with impaired neurocognitive performance (problems with memory, naming, and word finding). CONCLUSIONS Cognitive deficits and depression appear to be more common in aging former NFL players compared with healthy controls. These deficits are correlated with white matter abnormalities and changes in regional cerebral blood flow.",Adult Aged Aging/pathology/*psychology Athletes/*psychology Brain Concussion/diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology Cross-Sectional Studies Depression/diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology Football/*psychology Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods Male Middle Aged Neuroimaging/methods Retirement/*psychology Retrospective Studies Texas/epidemiology United States/epidemiology
25157724,Collaborative care for adolescents with depression in primary care: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Richardson LP and Ludman E and McCauley E and Lindenbaum J and Larison C and Zhou C and Clarke G and Brent D and Katon W,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Up to 20% of adolescents experience an episode of major depression by age 18 years yet few receive evidence-based treatments for their depression. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a collaborative care intervention for adolescents with depression improves depressive outcomes compared with usual care. DESIGN: Randomized trial with blinded outcome assessment conducted between April 2010 and April 2013. SETTING: Nine primary care clinics in the Group Health system in Washington State. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents (aged 13-17 years) who screened positive for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item [PHQ-9] score >/=10) on 2 occasions or who screened positive and met criteria for major depression, spoke English, and had telephone access were recruited. Exclusions included alcohol/drug misuse, suicidal plan or recent attempt, bipolar disorder, developmental delay, and seeing a psychiatrist. INTERVENTIONS: Twelve-month collaborative care intervention including an initial in-person engagement session and regular follow-up by master's-level clinicians. Usual care control youth received depression screening results and could access mental health services through Group Health. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in depressive symptoms on a modified version of the Child Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R; score range, 14-94) from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes included change in Columbia Impairment Scale score (CIS), depression response (>/=50% decrease on the CDRS-R), and remission (PHQ-9 score <5). RESULTS: Intervention youth (n = 50), compared with those randomized to receive usual care (n = 51), had greater decreases in CDRS-R scores such that by 12 months intervention youth had a mean score of 27.5 (95% CI, 23.8-31.1) compared with 34.6 (95% CI, 30.6-38.6) in control youth (overall intervention effect: F2,747.3 = 7.24, P < .001). Both intervention and control youth experienced improvement on the CIS with no significant differences between groups. At 12 months, intervention youth were more likely than control youth to achieve depression response (67.6% vs 38.6%, OR = 3.3, 95% CI, 1.4-8.2; P = .009) and remission (50.4% vs 20.7%, OR = 3.9, 95% CI, 1.5-10.6; P = .007). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adolescents with depression seen in primary care, a collaborative care intervention resulted in greater improvement in depressive symptoms at 12 months than usual care. These findings suggest that mental health services for adolescents with depression can be integrated into primary care.

There has been minimal study of collaborative care (CC) management models for mental health disorders in high-risk cardiac inpatients, and no prior CC intervention has simultaneously managed depression and anxiety disorders. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of a low-intensity CC intervention for depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder among patients hospitalized for an acute cardiac illness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Single-blind randomized clinical trial, with study assessors blind to group assignment, from September 2010 through July 2013 of 183 patients admitted to inpatient cardiac units in an urban academic general hospital for acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, or heart failure and found to have clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, or panic disorder on structured assessment. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to 24 weeks of a low-intensity telephone-based multicomponent CC intervention targeting depression and anxiety disorders (n = 92) or to enhanced usual care (serial notification of primary medical providers; n = 91). The CC intervention used a social work care manager to coordinate assessment and stepped care of psychiatric conditions and to provide support and therapeutic interventions as appropriate. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Improvement in mental health-related quality of life (Short Form-12 Mental Component Score [SF-12 MCS]) at 24 weeks, compared between groups using a random-effects model in an intent-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: Patients randomized to CC had significantly greater estimated mean improvements in SF-12 MCS at 24 weeks (11.21 points [from 34.21 to 45.42] in the CC group vs 5.53 points [from 36.30 to 41.83] in the control group; estimated mean difference, 5.68 points [95% CI, 2.14-9.22]; P = .002; effect size, 0.61). Patients receiving CC also had significant improvements in depressive symptoms and general functioning, and higher rates of treatment of a mental health disorder; anxiety scores, rates of disorder response, and adherence did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A novel telephone-based, low-intensity model to concurrently manage cardiac patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders was effective for improving mental health-related quality of life in a 24-week trial.

Understanding this behavior among young drivers and how it may differ from alcohol-related driving behaviors could inform prevention efforts. OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence, sex differences, and risk factors associated with underage college students' driving after using marijuana, driving after drinking alcohol, or riding with a driver using these substances. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional telephone survey of a random sample of 315 first-year college students (aged 18-20 years) from 2 large public universities, who were participating in an ongoing longitudinal study. At recruitment, 52.8% of eligible individuals consented to participate; retention was 93.2% one year later when data for this report were collected. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported past-28-day driving after marijuana use, riding with a marijuana-using driver, driving after alcohol use, and riding with an alcohol-using driver. RESULTS: In the prior month, 20.3% of students had used marijuana. Among marijuana-using students, 43.9% of male and 8.7% of female students drove after using marijuana (P < .001), and 51.2% of male and 34.8% of female students rode as a passenger with a marijuana-using driver (P = .21). Most students (65.1%) drank alcohol, and among this group 12.0% of male students and 2.7% of female students drove after drinking (P = .01), with 20.7% and 11.5% (P = .07), respectively, reporting riding with an alcohol-using driver. Controlling for demographics and substance use behaviors, driving after substance use was associated with at least a 2-fold increase in risk of being a passenger with another user; the reverse was also true. A 1% increase in the reported percentage of friends using marijuana was associated with a 2% increased risk of riding with a marijuana-using driver (95% CI, 1.01-1.03). Among students using any substances, past-28-day use of only marijuana was associated with a 6.24-fold increased risk of driving after substance use compared with using only alcohol (95% CI, 1.89-21.17). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Driving and riding after marijuana use is common among underage, marijuana-using college students.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir with weight-based or low-dose ribavirin among a population with unfavorable treatment characteristics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Single-center, randomized, 2-part, open-label phase 2 study involving 60 treatment-naive patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 enrolled at the National Institutes of Health (October 2011-April 2012). INTERVENTIONS: In the study's first part, 10 participants with early to moderate liver fibrosis were treated with 400 mg/d of sofosbuvir and weight-based ribavirin for 24 weeks. In the second part, 50 participants with all stages of liver fibrosis were randomized 1:1 to receive 400 mg of sofosbuvir with either weight-based or low-dose 600 mg/d of ribavirin for 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary study end point was the proportion of participants with undetectable HCV viral load 24 weeks after treatment completion (sustained virologic response of 24 weeks [SVR24]). RESULTS: In the first part of the study, 9 participants (90%; 95% CI, 55%-100%) achieved SVR24. In the second part, 7 participants (28%) in the weight-based group and 10 (40%) in the low-dose group relapsed after treatment completion leading to SVR24 rates of 68% (95% CI, 46%-85%) in the weight-based group and 48% (95% CI, 28%-69%; P = .20) in the low-dose group. Twenty individuals participated in a pharmacokinetic-viral kinetic substudy, which demonstrated a slower loss rate of infectious virus in relapsers than in participants who achieved SVR (clearance, 3.57/d vs 5.60/d; P = .009). The most frequent adverse events were headache, anemia, fatigue, and nausea. There were 7 grade 3 events including anemia, neutropenia, nausea, hypophosphatemia, and cholelithiasis or pancreatitis. No one discontinued treatment due to adverse events. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In a population of patients with a high prevalence of unfavorable traditional predictors of treatment response, a 24-week regimen of sofosbuvir and weight-based or low-dose ribavirin resulted in SVR24 rates of 68% and 48%, respectively.

Knowing which prescription medications are the most effective in improving health outcomes for people with COPD is essential to maximizing health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term benefits of combination long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids compared with LABAs alone in a real-world setting. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Population-based, longitudinal cohort study conducted in Ontario, Canada, from 2003 to 2011. All individuals aged 66 years or older who met a validated case definition of COPD on the basis of health administrative data were included. After propensity score matching, there were 8712 new users of LABA-inhaled corticosteroid combination therapy and 3160 new users of LABAs alone who were followed up for median times of 2.7 years and 2.5 years, respectively. EXPOSURES: Newly prescribed combination LABAs and inhaled corticosteroids or LABAs alone. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Composite outcome of death and COPD hospitalization. RESULTS: The main outcome was observed among 5594 new users of LABAs and inhaled corticosteroids (3174 deaths [36.4%]; 2420 COPD hospitalizations [27.8%]) and 2129 new users of LABAs alone (1179 deaths [37.3%]; 950 COPD hospitalizations [30.1%]). New use of LABAs and inhaled corticosteroids was associated with a modestly reduced risk of death or COPD hospitalization compared with new use of LABAs alone (difference in composite outcome at 5 years, -3.7%; 95% CI, -5.7% to -1.7%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among older adults with COPD, particularly those with asthma and those not receiving a long-acting anticholinergic medication, newly prescribed LABA and inhaled corticosteroid combination therapy, compared with newly prescribed LABAs alone, was associated with a significantly lower risk of the composite outcome of death or COPD hospitalization.",Missing
23232895,Effect of acetazolamide and autoCPAP therapy on breathing disturbances among patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome who travel to altitude: a randomized controlled trial.,JAMA,Latshang TD and Nussbaumer-Ochsner Y and Henn RM and Ulrich S and Lo Cascio CM and Ledergerber B and Kohler M and Bloch KE,Missing,"CONTEXT: Many patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) living near sea level travel to altitude, but this may expose them to hypoxemia and exacerbation of sleep apnea. The treatment in this setting is not established. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether acetazolamide and autoadjusted continuous positive airway pressure (autoCPAP) control breathing disturbances in OSA patients at altitude. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial involving 51 patients with OSA living below an altitude of 800 m and receiving CPAP therapy who underwent studies at a university hospital at 490 m and resorts in Swiss mountain villages at 1630 m and 2590 m in summer 2009. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were studied during 2 sojourns of 3 days each in mountain villages, 2 days at 1630 m, 1 day at 2590 m, separated by a 2-week washout period at less than 800 m. At altitude, patients either took acetazolamide (750 mg/d) or placebo in addition to autoCPAP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were nocturnal oxygen saturation and the apnea/hypopnea index; secondary outcomes were sleep structure, vigilance, symptoms, adverse effects, and exercise performance. RESULTS: Acetazolamide and autoCPAP treatment was associated with higher nocturnal oxygen saturation at 1630 m and 2590 m than placebo and autoCPAP: medians, 94% (interquartile range [IQR], 93%-95%) and 91% (IQR, 90%-92%) vs 93% (IQR, 92%-94%) and 89% (IQR, 87%-91%), respectively. Median increases were 1.0% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.0%) and 2.0% (95% CI, 2.0%-2.0). Median night-time spent with oxygen saturation less than 90% at 2590 m was 13% (IQR, 2%-38%) vs 57% (IQR, 28%-82%; P < .001). Acetazolamide and autoCPAP resulted in better control of sleep apnea at 1630 m and 2590 m than placebo and autoCPAP: median apnea/hypopnea index was 5.8 events per hour (5.8/h) (IQR, 3.0/h-10.1/h) and 6.8/h (IQR, 3.5/h-10.1/h) vs 10.7/h (IQR, 5.1/h-17.7/h) and 19.3/h (IQR, 9.3/h-29.0/h), respectively; median reduction was 3.2/h (95% CI, 1.3/h-7.5/h) and 9.2 (95% CI, 5.1/h-14.6/h).

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether combined vasopressin-epinephrine during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and corticosteroid supplementation during and after CPR improve survival to hospital discharge with a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score of 1 or 2 in vasopressor-requiring, in-hospital cardiac arrest. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial performed from September 1, 2008, to October 1, 2010, in 3 Greek tertiary care centers (2400 beds) with 268 consecutive patients with cardiac arrest requiring epinephrine according to resuscitation guidelines (from 364 patients assessed for eligibility). INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either vasopressin (20 IU/CPR cycle) plus epinephrine (1 mg/CPR cycle; cycle duration approximately 3 minutes) (VSE group, n = 130) or saline placebo plus epinephrine (1 mg/CPR cycle; cycle duration approximately 3 minutes) (control group, n = 138) for the first 5 CPR cycles after randomization, followed by additional epinephrine if needed. During the first CPR cycle after randomization, patients in the VSE group received methylprednisolone (40 mg) and patients in the control group received saline placebo. Shock after resuscitation was treated with stress-dose hydrocortisone (300 mg daily for 7 days maximum and gradual taper) (VSE group, n = 76) or saline placebo (control group, n = 73). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for 20 minutes or longer and survival to hospital discharge with a CPC score of 1 or 2. RESULTS: Follow-up was completed in all resuscitated patients. Patients in the VSE group vs patients in the control group had higher probability for ROSC of 20 minutes or longer (109/130 [83.9%] vs 91/138 [65.9%]; odds ratio [OR], 2.98; 95% CI, 1.39-6.40; P = .005) and survival to hospital discharge with CPC score of 1 or 2 (18/130 [13.9%] vs 7/138 [5.1%]; OR, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.17-9.20; P = .02). Patients in the VSE group with postresuscitation shock vs corresponding patients in the control group had higher probability for survival to hospital discharge with CPC scores of 1 or 2 (16/76 [21.1%] vs 6/73 [8.2%]; OR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.20-11.62; P = .02), improved hemodynamics and central venous oxygen saturation, and less organ dysfunction. Adverse event rates were similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with cardiac arrest requiring vasopressors, combined vasopressin-epinephrine and methylprednisolone during CPR and stress-dose hydrocortisone in postresuscitation shock, compared with epinephrine/saline placebo, resulted in improved survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurological status.

OBJECTIVE: To determine efficacy and safety of varenicline and bupropion sustained-release (SR; combination therapy) compared with varenicline (monotherapy) in cigarette smokers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial with a 12-week treatment period and follow-up through week 52 conducted between October 2009 and April 2013 at 3 midwestern clinical research sites. Five hundred six adult (>/=18 years) cigarette smokers were randomly assigned and 315 (62%) completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Twelve weeks of varenicline and bupropion SR or varenicline and placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was abstinence rates at week 12, defined as prolonged (no smoking from 2 weeks after the target quit date) abstinence and 7-day point-prevalence (no smoking past 7 days) abstinence. Secondary outcomes were prolonged and point-prevalence smoking abstinence rates at weeks 26 and 52. Outcomes were biochemically confirmed. RESULTS: At 12 weeks, 53.0% of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged smoking abstinence and 56.2% achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 43.2% and 48.6% in varenicline monotherapy (odds ratio [OR], 1.49; 95% CI, 1.05-2.12; P = .03 and OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.95-1.93; P = .09, respectively). At 26 weeks, 36.6% of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 38.2% achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 27.6% and 31.9% in varenicline monotherapy (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.04-2.22; P = .03 and OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.91-1.91; P = .14, respectively). At 52 weeks, 30.9% of the combination therapy group achieved prolonged and 36.6% achieved 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence compared with 24.5% and 29.2% in varenicline monotherapy (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.93-2.07; P = .11 and OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.96-2.05; P = .08, respectively). Participants receiving combination therapy reported more anxiety (7.2% vs 3.1%; P = .04) and depressive symptoms (3.6% vs 0.8%; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among cigarette smokers, combined use of varenicline and bupropion, compared with varenicline alone, increased prolonged abstinence but not 7-day point prevalence at 12 and 26 weeks. Neither outcome was significantly different at 52 weeks. Further research is required to determine the role of combination therapy in smoking cessation.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the rates of HCV eradication (sustained virologic response [SVR]) and adverse events in patients with HCV-HIV coinfection receiving sofosbuvir and ribavirin treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Open-label, nonrandomized, uncontrolled phase 3 trial conducted at 34 treatment centers in the United States and Puerto Rico (August 2012-November 2013) evaluating treatment with sofosbuvir and ribavirin among patients with HCV genotypes 1, 2, or 3 and concurrent HIV. Patients were required to be receiving ART with HIV RNA values of 50 copies/mL or less and a CD4 T-cell count of more than 200 cells/muL or to have untreated HIV infection with a CD4 T-cell count of more than 500 cells/muL. Of the treatment-naive patients, 114 had HCV genotype 1 and 68 had HCV genotype 2 or 3, and 41 treatment experienced participants who had been treated with peginterferon-ribavirin had HCV genotype 2 or 3, for a total of 223 participants. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 received 400 mg of sofosbuvir and weight-based ribavirin for 12 weeks and treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1 and treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 received the same treatment for 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary study outcome was the proportion of patients with SVR (serum HCV <25 copies/mL) 12 weeks (SVR12) after cessation of HCV therapy. RESULTS: Among treatment-naive participants, 87 patients (76%) of 114 (95% CI, 67%-84%) with genotype 1, 23 patients (88%) of 26 with genotype 2 (95% CI, 70%-985), and 28 patients (67%) of 42 with genotype 3 (95% CI, 51%-80%) achieved SVR12. Among treatment-experienced participants, 22 patients (92%) of 24 with genotype 2 (95% CI, 73%-99%) and 16 patients (94%) of 17 (95% CI, 71%-100%) achieved SVR12. The most common adverse events were fatigue, insomnia, headache, and nausea. Seven patients (3%) discontinued HCV treatment due to adverse events. No adverse effect on HIV disease or its treatment was observed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this open-label, nonrandomized, uncontrolled study, patients with HIV who were coinfected with HCV genotype 1, 2, or 3 who received the oral, interferon-free combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks had high rates of SVR12. Further studies of this oral regimen in diverse populations of coinfected patients are warranted.

25230094,Afamelanotide and Narrowband UV-B Phototherapy for the Treatment of Vitiligo: A Randomized Multicenter Trial.,JAMA Dermatol,Lim HW and Grimes PE and Agbai O and Hamzavi I and Henderson M and Haddican M and Linkner RV and Lebwohl M,Missing,"Importance: Narrowband UV-B (NB-UV-B) phototherapy is used extensively to treat vitiligo. Afamelanotide, an analogue of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, is known to induce tanning of the skin. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy for generalized vitiligo consisting of afamelanotide implant and NB-UV-B phototherapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study was performed in 2 academic outpatient dermatology centers and 1 private dermatology practice. We enrolled men and women 18 years or older with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes (SPTs) III to VI and a confirmed diagnosis of nonsegmental vitiligo that involved 15% to 50% of total body surface area. Vitiligo was stable or slowly progressive for 3 months. Patients were randomized to combination therapy (n = 28) vs NB-UV-B monotherapy (n = 27). After 1 month of NB-UV-B phototherapy, 16 mg of afamelanotide was administered subcutaneously to the combination therapy group monthly for 4 months while NB-UV-B phototherapy continued; the other group continued to receive NB-UV-B monotherapy. Interventions: Narrowband UV-B monotherapy vs combined NB-UV-B phototherapy and afamelanotide. Main Outcomes and Measures: Response on the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index and Vitiligo European Task Force scoring system. Results: Response in the combination therapy group was superior to that in the NB-UV-B monotherapy group (P < .05) at day 56. For the face and upper extremities, a significantly higher percentage of patients in the combination therapy group achieved repigmentation, and at earlier times (face, 41.0 vs 61.0 days [P = .001]; upper extremities, 46.0 vs 69.0 days [P = .003]). In the combination therapy group, repigmentation was 48.64% (95% CI, 39.49%-57.80%) at day 168 vs 33.26% (95% CI, 24.18%-42.33%) in the NB-UV-B monotherapy group. Notable adverse events included erythema in both groups and minor infections and nausea in the combination therapy group. Comparison between Fitzpatrick SPTs showed patients with SPTs IV to VI in the combination therapy group had improvement in the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index at days 56 and 84 (P < .05); no significant difference was noted in patients with SPT III. Conclusions and Relevance: A combination of afamelanotide implant and NB-UV-B phototherapy resulted in clinically apparent, statistically significant superior and faster repigmentation compared with NB-UV-B monotherapy. The response was more noticeable in patients with SPTs IV to VI. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01430195.",Missing
25027140,Effects of hydroxychloroquine on symptomatic improvement in primary Sjogren syndrome: the JOQUER randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Gottenberg JE and Ravaud P and Puechal X and Le Guern V and Sibilia J and Goeb V and Larroche C and Dubost JJ and Rist S and Saraux A and Devauchelle-Pensec V and Morel J and Hayem G and Hatron P and Perdriger A and Sene D and Zarnitsky C and Batouche D and Furlan V and Benessiano J and Perrodeau E and Seror R and Mariette X,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Primary Sjogren syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by mouth and eye dryness, pain, and fatigue. Hydroxychloroquine is the most frequently prescribed immunosuppressant for the syndrome. However, evidence regarding its efficacy is limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the main symptoms of primary Sjogren syndrome: dryness, pain, and fatigue. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From April 2008 to May 2011, 120 patients with primary Sjogren syndrome according to American-European Consensus Group Criteria from 15 university hospitals in France were randomized in a double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were assessed at baseline, week 12, week 24 (primary outcome), and week 48. The last follow-up date for the last patient was May 15, 2012. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/d) or placebo until week 24. All patients were prescribed hydroxychloroquine between weeks 24 and 48. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a 30% or greater reduction between weeks 0 and 24 in scores on 2 of 3 numeric analog scales (from 0 [best] to 10 [worst]) evaluating dryness, pain, and fatigue. RESULTS: At 24 weeks, the proportion of patients meeting the primary end point was 17.9% (10/56) in the hydroxychloroquine group and 17.2% (11/64) in the placebo group (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.37-2.78; P = .98). Between weeks 0 and 24, the mean (SD) numeric analog scale score for dryness changed from 6.38 (2.14) to 5.85 (2.57) in the placebo group and 6.53 (1.97) to 6.22 (1.87) in the hydroxychloroquine group. The mean (SD) numeric analog scale score for pain changed from 4.92 (2.94) to 5.08 (2.48) in the placebo group and 5.09 (3.06) to 4.59 (2.90) in the hydroxychloroquine group. The mean (SD) numeric analog scale for fatigue changed from 6.26 (2.27) to 5.72 (2.38) in the placebo group and 6.00 (2.52) to 5.94 (2.40) in the hydroxychloroquine group. All but 1 patient in the hydroxychloroquine group had detectable blood levels of the drug. Hydroxychloroquine had no efficacy in patients with anti-SSA autoantibodies, high IgG levels, or systemic involvement. During the first 24 weeks, there were 2 serious adverse events in the hydroxychloroquine group and 3 in the placebo group; in the last 24 weeks, there were 3 serious adverse events in the hydroxychloroquine group and 4 in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with primary Sjogren syndrome, the use of hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo did not improve symptoms during 24 weeks of treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of selumetinib, a selective, non-adenosine triphosphate competitive inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, in uveal melanoma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, open-label, phase 2 clinical trial comparing selumetinib vs chemotherapy conducted from August 2010 through December 2013 among 120 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma at 15 academic oncology centers in the United States and Canada. INTERVENTIONS: One hundred one patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive selumetinib, 75 mg orally twice daily on a continual basis (n = 50), or chemotherapy (temozolomide, 150 mg/m2 orally daily for 5 of every 28 days, or dacarbazine, 1000 mg/m2 intravenously every 21 days [investigator choice]; n = 51) until disease progression, death, intolerable adverse effects, or withdrawal of consent. After primary outcome analysis, 19 patients were registered and 18 treated with selumetinib without randomization to complete the planned 120-patient enrollment. Patients in the chemotherapy group could receive selumetinib at the time of radiographic progression. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Progression-free survival, the primary end point, was assessed as of April 22, 2013. Additional end points, including overall survival, response rate, and safety/toxicity, were assessed as of December 31, 2013. RESULTS: Median progression-free survival among patients randomized to chemotherapy was 7 weeks (95% CI, 4.3-8.4 weeks; median treatment duration, 8 weeks; interquartile range [IQR], 4.3-16 weeks) and among those randomized to selumetinib was 15.9 weeks (95% CI, 8.4-21.1 weeks; median treatment duration, 16.1 weeks; IQR, 8.1-25.3 weeks) (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30-0.71; P < .001). Median overall survival time was 9.1 months (95% CI, 6.1-11.1 months) with chemotherapy and 11.8 months (95% CI, 9.8-15.7 months) with selumetinib (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.41-1.06; P = .09). No objective responses were observed with chemotherapy. Forty-nine percent of patients treated with selumetinib achieved tumor regression, with 14% achieving an objective radiographic response to therapy. Treatment-related adverse events were observed in 97% of patients treated with selumetinib, with 37% requiring at least 1 dose reduction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this hypothesis-generating study of patients with advanced uveal melanoma, selumetinib compared with chemotherapy resulted in a modestly improved progression-free survival and response rate; however, no improvement in overall survival was observed. Improvement in clinical outcomes was accompanied by a high rate of adverse events.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to compare in-hospital outcomes of CDT plus anticoagulation with those of anticoagulation alone. The secondary objective was to evaluate the temporal trends in the utilization and outcomes of CDT in the treatment of proximal DVT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational study of patients with a principal discharge diagnosis of proximal or caval DVT from 2005 to 2010 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. We compared patients treated with CDT plus anticoagulation with the patients treated with anticoagulation alone. We used propensity scores to construct 2 matched groups of 3594 patients in each group for comparative outcomes analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary study outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes included bleeding complications, length of stay, and hospital charges. RESULTS: Among a total of 90 618 patients hospitalized for DVT (national estimate of 449 200 hospitalizations), 3649 (4.1%) underwent CDT. The CDT utilization rates increased from 2.3% in 2005 to 5.9% in 2010. Based on the propensity-matched comparison, the in-hospital mortality was not significantly different between the CDT and the anticoagulation groups (1.2% vs 0.9%) (OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 0.88-2.25]) (P = .15). The rates of blood transfusion (11.1% vs 6.5%) (OR, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.57-2.20]) (P < .001), pulmonary embolism (17.9% vs 11.4%) (OR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.49-1.94]) (P < .001), intracranial hemorrhage (0.9% vs 0.3%) (OR, 2.72 [95% CI, 1.40-5.30]) (P = .03), and vena cava filter placement (34.8% vs 15.6%) (OR, 2.89 [95% CI, 2.58-3.23]) (P < .001) were significantly higher in the CDT group. The CDT group had longer mean (SD) length of stay (7.2 [5.8] vs 5.0 [4.7] days) (OR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.49-1.94]) (P < .001) and higher hospital charges ($85 094 [$69 121] vs $28 164 [$42 067]) (P < .001) compared with the anticoagulation group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, we did not find any difference in the mortality between the CDT and the anticoagulation groups, but evidence of higher adverse events was noted in the CDT group. In the context of this observational data and continued improvements in technology, a randomized trial with outcomes such as mortality and postthrombotic syndrome is needed to definitively address this comparative effectiveness.",Missing

Different from surgery, transcatheter deployment of valves requires either a balloon-expandable or self-expandable system. A randomized comparison of these 2 systems has not been performed. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the balloon-expandable device is associated with a better success rate than the self-expandable device. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The CHOICE study was an investigator-initiated trial in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis and an anatomy suitable for the transfemoral TAVR procedure. One hundred twenty-one patients were randomly assigned to receive a balloon-expandable valve (Edwards Sapien XT) and 120 were assigned to receive a self-expandable valve (Medtronic CoreValve). Patients were enrolled between March 2012 and December 2013 at 5 centers in Germany. INTERVENTIONS: Transfemoral TAVR with a balloon-expandable or self-expandable device. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was device success, which is a composite end point including successful vascular access and deployment of the device and retrieval of the delivery system, correct position of the device, intended performance of the heart valve without moderate or severe regurgitation, and only 1 valve implanted in the proper anatomical location. Secondary end points included cardiovascular mortality, bleeding and vascular complications, postprocedural pacemaker placement, and a combined safety end point at 30 days, including all-cause mortality, major stroke, and other serious complications. RESULTS: Device success occurred in 116 of 121 patients (95.9%) in the balloon-expandable valve group and 93 of 120 patients (77.5%) in the self-expandable valve group (relative risk [RR], 1.24, 95% CI, 1.12-1.37, P < .001). This was attributed to a significantly lower frequency of residual more-than-mild aortic regurgitation (4.1% vs 18.3%; RR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09-0.58; P < .001) and the less frequent need for implanting more than 1 valve (0.8% vs 5.8%, P = .03) in the balloon-expandable valve group. Cardiovascular mortality at 30 days was 4.1% in the balloon-expandable valve group and 4.3% in the self-expandable valve group (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.29-3.25; P = .99). Bleeding and vascular complications were not significantly different, and the combined safety end point occurred in 18.2% of those in the balloon-expandable valve group and 23.1% of the self-expandable valve group (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.48-1.30; P = .42). Placement of a new permanent pacemaker was less frequent in the balloon-expandable valve group (17.3% vs 37.6%, P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with high-risk aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR, the use of a balloon-expandable valve resulted in a greater rate of device success than use of a self-expandable valve.

Which diet is best remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine weight loss outcomes for popular diets based on diet class (macronutrient composition) and named diet. DATA SOURCES: Search of 6 electronic databases: AMED, CDSR, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, and MEDLINE from inception of each database to April 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Overweight or obese adults (body mass index >/=25) randomized to a popular self-administered named diet and reporting weight or body mass index data at 3-month follow-up or longer. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data on populations, interventions, outcomes, risk of bias, and quality of evidence. A Bayesian framework was used to perform a series of random-effects network meta-analyses with meta-regression to estimate the relative effectiveness of diet classes and programs for change in weight and body mass index from baseline. Our analyses adjusted for behavioral support and exercise. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Weight loss and body mass index at 6- and 12-month follow-up (+/-3 months for both periods). RESULTS: Among 59 eligible articles reporting 48 unique randomized trials (including 7286 individuals) and compared with no diet, the largest weight loss was associated with low-carbohydrate diets (8.73 kg [95% credible interval {CI}, 7.27 to 10.20 kg] at 6-month follow-up and 7.25 kg [95% CI, 5.33 to 9.25 kg] at 12-month follow-up) and low-fat diets (7.99 kg [95% CI, 6.01 to 9.92 kg] at 6-month follow-up and 7.27 kg [95% CI, 5.26 to 9.34 kg] at 12-month follow-up). Weight loss differences between individual diets were minimal. For example, the Atkins diet resulted in a 1.71 kg greater weight loss than the Zone diet at 6-month follow-up. Between 6- and 12-month follow-up, the influence of behavioral support (3.23 kg [95% CI, 2.23 to 4.23 kg] at 6-month follow-up vs 1.08 kg [95% CI, -1.82 to 3.96 kg] at 12-month follow-up) and exercise (0.64 kg [95% CI, -0.35 to 1.66 kg] vs 2.13 kg [95% CI, 0.43 to 3.85 kg], respectively) on weight loss differed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Significant weight loss was observed with any low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet. Weight loss differences between individual named diets were small. This supports the practice of recommending any diet that a patient will adhere to in order to lose weight.","Adult *Diet, Carbohydrate-Restricted *Diet, Fat-Restricted Humans Names Obesity/*diet therapy Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Weight Loss"

The relative effectiveness of long-acting injectable versions of second-generation and older antipsychotics has not been assessed. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of the second-generation long-acting injectable antipsychotic paliperidone palmitate with the older long-acting injectable antipsychotic haloperidol decanoate. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multisite, double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted from March 2011 to July 2013 at 22 US clinical research sites. Randomized patients (n = 311) were adults diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were clinically assessed to be at risk of relapse and likely to benefit from a long-acting injectable antipsychotic. INTERVENTIONS: Intramuscular injections of haloperidol decanoate 25 to 200 mg or paliperidone palmitate 39 to 234 mg every month for as long as 24 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Efficacy failure, defined as a psychiatric hospitalization, a need for crisis stabilization, a substantial increase in frequency of outpatient visits, a clinician's decision that oral antipsychotic could not be discontinued within 8 weeks after starting the long-acting injectable antipsychotics, or a clinician's decision to discontinue the assigned long-acting injectable due to inadequate therapeutic benefit. Key secondary outcomes were common adverse effects of antipsychotic medications. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of efficacy failure for paliperidone palmitate compared with haloperidol decanoate (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.65-1.47). The number of participants who experienced efficacy failure was 49 (33.8%) in the paliperidone palmitate group and 47 (32.4%) in the haloperidol decanoate group. On average, participants in the paliperidone palmitate group gained weight and those in the haloperidol decanoate group lost weight; after 6 months, the least-squares mean weight change for those taking paliperidone palmitate was increased by 2.17 kg (95% CI, 1.25-3.09) and was decreased for those taking haloperidol decanoate (-0.96 kg; 95% CI, -1.88 to -0.04). Patients taking paliperidone palmitate had significantly higher maximum mean levels of serum prolactin (men, 34.56 microg/L [95% CI, 29.75-39.37] vs 15.41 microg/L [95% CI, 10.73-20.08]; P <.001, and for women, 75.19 [95% CI, 63.03-87.36] vs 26.84 [95% CI, 13.29-40.40]; P<.001). Patients taking haloperidol decanoate had significantly larger increases in global ratings of akathisia (0.73 [95% CI, 0.59-0.87] vs 0.45 [95% CI, 0.31-0.59]; P=.006). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, use of paliperidone palmitate vs haloperidol decanoate did not result in a statistically significant difference in efficacy failure, but was associated with more weight gain and greater increases in serum prolactin, whereas haloperidol decanoate was associated with more akathisia. However, the CIs do not rule out the possibility of a clinically meaningful advantage with paliperidone palmitate.

24715074,Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors vs conventional chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer harboring wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor: a meta-analysis.,JAMA,Lee JK and Hahn S and Kim DW and Suh KJ and Keam B and Kim TM and Lee SH and Heo DS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Current guidelines recommend both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs as standard treatment options for patients with wild-type (WT) EGFR who were previously treated for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, it is not clear that EGFR TKIs are as efficacious as chemotherapy in patients with WT EGFR. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between first-generation EGFR TKI vs chemotherapy and survival in advanced NSCLC patients with WT EGFR. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane database, and meeting abstracts of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and European Society of Medical Oncology through December 2013. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials comparing EGFR TKI with conventional chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Out of 1947 retrieved articles, 11 trials incorporating 1605 patients with WT EGFR were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers extracted trial characteristics and outcomes. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane tool. All measures were pooled using random-effects models and 95% CIs were calculated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS), measured as hazard ratios (HRs). The secondary outcomes were objective response rate and overall survival, expressed as relative risks and HRs, respectively. RESULTS: Among patients with WT EGFR tumors, chemotherapy was associated with improvement of PFS, compared with TKI (HR for TKI, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.10-1.81). No statistically significant subgroup difference was identified in terms of line of treatment (first-line vs second- or later-line), experimental drug, dominant ethnicity, or EGFR mutation analysis method. Trials using more sensitive platforms than direct sequencing were associated with a significant PFS benefit with chemotherapy (HR for TKI, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.35-2.52). The association of chemotherapy with improvement in PFS was also significant in second- or later-line trials (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09-1.65). The objective response rate was higher with chemotherapy (92/549, 16.8%, vs 39/540, 7.2%, for TKI; relative risk for TKI, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.21); however, no statistically significant difference was observed with respect to overall survival (HR for TKI, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.96-1.22). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with advanced NSCLC harboring WT EGFR, conventional chemotherapy, compared with first-generation EGFR TKI, was associated with improvement in PFS but not overall survival.","Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy Disease-Free Survival Humans Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy Mutation Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics"
25155481,Effect of Advancing Age on Outcomes of Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson Disease.,JAMA Neurol,DeLong MR and Huang KT and Gallis J and Lokhnygina Y and Parente B and Hickey P and Turner DA and Lad SP,Missing,"Importance: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established modality for the treatment of advanced Parkinson disease (PD). Recent studies have found DBS plus best medical therapy to be superior to best medical therapy alone for patients with PD and early motor complications. Although no specific age cutoff has been defined, most clinical studies have excluded patients older than 75 years of age. We hypothesize that increasing age would be associated with an increased number of postoperative complications. Objective: To evaluate the stepwise effect of increasing age (in 5-year epochs) on short-term complications following DBS surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: A large, retrospective cohort study was performed using the Thomson Reuters MarketScan national database that examined 1757 patients who underwent DBS for PD during the period from 2000 to 2009. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary measures examined included hospital length of stay and aggregate and individual complications within 90 days following surgery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to calculate complication-related odds ratios (ORs) for each 5-year age epoch after controlling for covariates. Results: Overall, 132 of 1757 patients (7.5%) experienced at least 1 complication within 90 days, including wound infections (3.6%), pneumonia (2.3%), hemorrhage or hematoma (1.4%), or pulmonary embolism (0.6%). After adjusting for covariates, we found that increasing age (ranging from <50 to 90 years of age) did not significantly affect overall 90-day complication rates (OR, 1.10 per 5-year increase [95% CI, 0.96-1.25]; P = .17). The 2 most common procedure-related complications, hemorrhage (OR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.63-1.07]; P = .14) and infection (OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.87-1.24]; P = .69), did not significantly increase with age. Conclusions and Relevance: Older patients with PD (>75 years) who were selected to undergo DBS surgery showed a similar 90-day complication risk (including postoperative hemorrhage or infection) compared with younger counterparts. Our findings suggest that age alone should not be a primary exclusion factor for determining candidacy for DBS. Instead, a clear focus on patients with medication-refractory and difficult to control on-off fluctuations with preserved cognition, regardless of age, may allow for an expansion of the traditional therapeutic window.",Missing
25144163,Survival outcomes in advanced laryngeal cancer.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Megwalu UC and Sikora AG,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Chemoradiation therapy has become increasingly popular in the treatment of advanced laryngeal cancer as part of an organ preservation protocol. However, several studies have reported a decline in survival, possibly attributable to the increased use of radiation and chemoradiation therapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate survival outcomes of laryngeal conservation vs surgical therapy in the treatment of advanced laryngeal cancer in the United States using a large population-based cancer database. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based, nonconcurrent cohort study of 5394 patients who received a diagnosis of stage III or IV laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma between 1992 and 2009. Data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 Database. INTERVENTIONS: Surgical or nonsurgical therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). RESULTS: Patients who received surgical therapy had better 2-year and 5-year DSS (70% vs 64% and 55% vs 51%, respectively; P < .001) and 2-year and 5-year OS (64% vs 57% and 44% vs 39%, respectively; P < .001) than patients who received nonsurgical therapy. The difference in DSS and OS between treatment groups remained after stratification by year-of-diagnosis cohorts (P < .001). The survival gap consistently narrowed with subsequent year-of-diagnosis cohorts. On multivariable analysis, nonsurgical patients had worse DSS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.33 [95% CI, 1.21-1.45]) and OS (HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.22-1.43]) after adjustment for year of diagnosis, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, age, sex, subsite, race, and marital status. Stage III disease (HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.54-0.65]), glottic subsite (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.67-0.82]), 2004 to 2009 year-of-diagnosis cohort (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.70-0.90]), female sex (HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.72-0.89]), and married status (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.62-0.75]) positively affected DSS. Black race (HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.05-1.30]) and increased age (HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.02-1.03] for each year) negatively affected DSS. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Surgical therapy leads to better survival outcomes than nonsurgical therapy for patients with advanced laryngeal cancer. Patients need to be made aware of the modest but significant survival disadvantage associated with nonsurgical therapy as part of the shared decision-making process during treatment selection.",Missing

Current evidence is unclear about the role of hypertonic saline (HS) for the acute treatment of bronchiolitis. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether nebulized 3% HS compared with normal saline (NS) improves respiratory distress in infants with bronchiolitis not responding to standard treatments in the emergency department. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial with blinding of investigators, health care providers, and parents was conducted at a single urban pediatric ED. The participants included children aged 2 to less than 24 months with their first episode of bronchiolitis and a Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument score of 4 to 15 after nasal suctioning and a trial of nebulized albuterol. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive either nebulized 3% HS (HS group) or NS (NS group). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in respiratory distress at 1 hour after the intervention, as measured by the Respiratory Assessment Change Score (a decrease indicates improvement). Secondary outcomes included vital signs, oxygen saturation, hospitalization, physician clinical impression, parental assessment, and adverse events. RESULTS: The 31 patients enrolled in each treatment arm had similar baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. At 1 hour after the intervention, the HS group demonstrated significantly less improvement in the median Respiratory Assessment Change Score compared with the NS group (HS, -1 [interquartile range, -5 to 1] vs. NS, -5 [interquartile range, -6 to -2]; P = .01). There were no significant differences in heart rate, oxygen saturation, hospitalization rate, or other outcomes. There were no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Infants with bronchiolitis and persistent respiratory distress after standard treatment in the emergency department had less improvement after receiving 3% HS compared with those who received NS. Based on these results and the existing evidence, administration of a single dose of 3% HS does not appear to be indicated to treat bronchiolitis in the acute care setting.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term outcomes of conservative management vs intervention for unruptured bAVM. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Population-based inception cohort study of 204 residents of Scotland aged 16 years or older who were first diagnosed as having an unruptured bAVM during 1999-2003 or 2006-2010 and followed up prospectively for 12 years. EXPOSURES: Conservative management (no intervention) vs intervention (any endovascular embolization, neurosurgical excision, or stereotactic radiosurgery alone or in combination). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cox regression analyses, with multivariable adjustment for prognostic factors and baseline imbalances if hazards were proportional, to compare rates of the primary outcome (death or sustained morbidity of any cause by Oxford Handicap Scale [OHS] score >/=2 for >/=2 successive years [0 = no symptoms and 6 = death]) and the secondary outcome (nonfatal symptomatic stroke or death due to bAVM, associated arterial aneurysm, or intervention). RESULTS: Of 204 patients, 103 underwent intervention. Those who underwent intervention were younger, more likely to have presented with seizure, and less likely to have large bAVMs than patients managed conservatively. During a median follow-up of 6.9 years (94% completeness), the rate of progression to the primary outcome was lower with conservative management during the first 4 years of follow-up (36 vs 39 events; 9.5 vs 9.8 per 100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35-0.99), but rates were similar thereafter. The rate of the secondary outcome was lower with conservative management during 12 years of follow-up (14 vs 38 events; 1.6 vs 3.3 per 100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19-0.72). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients aged 16 years or older diagnosed as having unruptured bAVM, use of conservative management compared with intervention was associated with better clinical outcomes for up to 12 years. Longer follow-up is required to understand whether this association persists.","Adult Aged Cohort Studies *Embolization, Therapeutic Female Humans Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery Male Middle Aged Neurosurgical Procedures/methods *Radiosurgery Scotland Survival Analysis Treatment Outcome *Watchful Waiting"

However, few studies have assessed whether COPD, a potentially modifiable factor, is associated with an increased risk for MCI and whether the relation is specific to the type of MCI. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a diagnosis of COPD and duration of COPD are associated with an increased risk for incident MCI and MCI subtypes (amnestic MCI [A-MCI] and nonamnestic MCI [NA-MCI]). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective population-based cohort from the Mayo Clinic Study on Aging. We included 1425 cognitively normal individuals aged 70 to 89 years who were randomly selected from Olmsted County, Minnesota, on October 1, 2004, using the medical records linkage system. At baseline and every 15 months thereafter, participants underwent assessment with a nurse interview, neurologic examination, and neuropsychological testing. A diagnosis of COPD was confirmed via medical record review. A baseline diagnosis of COPD and duration of COPD were examined as risk factors for MCI and MCI subtypes using Cox proportional hazards models and adjusting for demographic variables and medical comorbidities, with age as the time scale. EXPOSURE: A baseline diagnosis of COPD and duration of COPD. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident MCI, A-MCI, and NA-MCI. RESULTS: Of the 1425 participants with normal cognition at baseline, 370 developed incident MCI. The median duration of follow-up was 5.1 years (interquartile range, 3.8-5.4 years). A diagnosis of COPD significantly increased the risk for NA-MCI by 83% (hazard ratio, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.04-3.23]), but not of any MCI or A-MCI in multivariate analyses. We found a dose-response relationship such that individuals with COPD duration of longer than 5 years at baseline had the greatest risk for any MCI (hazard ratio, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.04-2.40]) and NA-MCI (2.58 [1.32-5.06]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A diagnosis of COPD is associated with an increased risk for MCI, particularly NA-MCI. We have found a dose-response relationship between COPD duration and risk for MCI. These findings highlight the importance of COPD as a risk factor for MCI and may provide a substrate for early intervention to prevent or delay the onset and progression of MCI, particularly NA-MCI.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies Cross-Sectional Studies Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Mild Cognitive Impairment/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology Population Surveillance/methods Prospective Studies Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology Risk Factors"

However, evidence on their combined efficacy is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of corticosteroid injection, multimodal physiotherapy, or both in patients with unilateral lateral epicondylalgia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A 2 x 2 factorial, randomized, injection-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at a single university research center and 16 primary care settings in Brisbane, Australia. A total of 165 patients aged 18 years or older with unilateral lateral epicondylalgia of longer than 6 weeks' duration were enrolled between July 2008 and May 2010; 1-year follow-up was completed in May 2011. INTERVENTIONS: Corticosteroid injection (n = 43), placebo injection (n = 41), corticosteroid injection plus physiotherapy (n = 40), or placebo injection plus physiotherapy (n = 41). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 2 primary outcomes were 1-year global rating of change scores for complete recovery or much improvement and 1-year recurrence (defined as complete recovery or much improvement at 4 or 8 weeks, but not later) analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis (P < .01). Secondary outcomes included complete recovery or much improvement at 4 and 26 weeks. RESULTS: Corticosteroid injection resulted in lower complete recovery or much improvement at 1 year vs placebo injection (83% vs 96%, respectively; relative risk [RR], 0.86 [99% CI, 0.75-0.99]; P = .01) and greater 1-year recurrence (54% vs 12%; RR, 0.23 [99% CI, 0.10-0.51]; P < .001). The physiotherapy and no physiotherapy groups did not differ on 1-year ratings of complete recovery or much improvement (91% vs 88%, respectively; RR, 1.04 [99% CI, 0.90-1.19]; P = .56) or recurrence (29% vs 38%; RR, 1.31 [99% CI, 0.73-2.35]; P = .25). Similar patterns were found at 26 weeks, with lower complete recovery or much improvement after corticosteroid injection vs placebo injection (55% vs 85%, respectively; RR, 0.79 [99% CI, 0.62-0.99]; P < .001) and no difference between the physiotherapy and no physiotherapy groups (71% vs 69%, respectively; RR, 1.22 [99% CI, 0.97-1.53]; P = .84). At 4 weeks, there was a significant interaction between corticosteroid injection and physiotherapy (P = .01), whereby patients receiving the placebo injection plus physiotherapy had greater complete recovery or much improvement vs no physiotherapy (39% vs 10%, respectively; RR, 4.00 [99% CI, 1.07-15.00]; P = .004). However, there was no difference between patients receiving the corticosteroid injection plus physiotherapy vs corticosteroid alone (68% vs 71%, respectively; RR, 0.95 [99% CI, 0.65-1.38]; P = .57).

Better understanding of the individual pathways to driving risk may lead to better-targeted intervention in this vulnerable group. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between cortisol, a neurobiological marker of stress regulation linked to risky behavior, and driving risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Naturalistic Teenage Driving Study was designed to continuously monitor the driving behavior of teenagers by instrumenting vehicles with kinematic sensors, cameras, and a global positioning system. During 2006-2008, a community sample of 42 newly licensed 16-year-old volunteer participants in the United States was recruited and driving behavior monitored. It was hypothesized in teenagers that higher cortisol response to stress is associated with (1) lower crash and near-crash (CNC) rates during their first 18 months of licensure and (2) faster reduction in CNC rates over time. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants' cortisol response during a stress-inducing task was assessed at baseline, followed by measurement of their involvement in CNCs and driving exposure during their first 18 months of licensure. Mixed-effect Poisson longitudinal regression models were used to examine the association between baseline cortisol response and CNC rates during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Participants with a higher baseline cortisol response had lower CNC rates during the follow-up period (exponential of the regression coefficient, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98) and faster decrease in CNC rates over time (exponential of the regression coefficient, 0.98; 95%, CI, 0.96-0.99). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cortisol is a neurobiological marker associated with teenaged-driving risk. As in other problem-behavior fields, identification of an objective marker of teenaged-driving risk promises the development of more personalized intervention approaches.","Accidents, Traffic/*statistics & numerical data Adolescent Adolescent Behavior/psychology *Automobile Driving Biological Markers/*blood Female Humans Hydrocortisone/*blood Longitudinal Studies Male Regression Analysis Risk-Taking Stress, Psychological/blood United States"

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate discharge practice patterns and use of post-acute care after surgical admissions at CAHs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2005-2009) and American Hospital Association to perform a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing common inpatient surgical procedures at CAHs or non-CAHs. EXPOSURES: The CAH status of the admitting hospital. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospital transfer, discharge with post-acute care, or routine discharge. RESULTS: Among the 1283 CAHs and 3612 non-CAHs included in the American Hospital Association annual survey, 34.8% and 36.4%, respectively, reported data to the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. For each of 6 common inpatient surgical procedures, a greater proportion of patients from CAHs were transferred to another hospital (P < .01); however, patients discharged from CAHs were less likely to receive post-acute care for all but 1 of the procedures examined (P < .01, except transurethral resection of prostate, P = .76). After adjustment for patient and hospital factors, the higher likelihood of transfer by CAHs vs non-CAHs persisted for 3 procedures: hip replacement (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.01-3.57), colorectal cancer resection (3.37; 2.23-5.09), and cholecystectomy (1.67; 1.27-2.19) (P < .05 for each), but differences in the use of post-acute care did not. In subset analyses, Medicare beneficiaries treated in CAHs were less likely to be discharged with post-acute care after hip fracture repair (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.89) and hip replacement (0.70; 95% CI, 0.51-0.96). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hospital transfers occur more often after surgical admissions at CAHs. However, the proportion of patients at CAHs using post-acute care is equal to or lower than that of patients treated in non-CAHs. These results will affect the ongoing debate concerning CAH payment policy and its implications for health care delivery in rural communities.","Comorbidity Female Health Services Accessibility Hospitals, Rural/*utilization Humans Male Outcome Assessment (Health Care) Patient Discharge/*statistics & numerical data Patient Transfer/*statistics & numerical data Physician's Practice Patterns/statistics & numerical data Subacute Care/*utilization *Surgical Procedures, Operative United States"

The primary sources of postnatal CMV infection in this population are breast milk and blood transfusion. The current risks attributable to these vectors, as well as the efficacy of approaches to prevent CMV transmission, are poorly characterized. Objective: To estimate the risk of postnatal CMV transmission from 2 sources: (1) transfusion of CMV-seronegative and leukoreduced blood and (2) maternal breast milk. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective, multicenter birth-cohort study was conducted from January 2010 to June 2013 at 3 neonatal intensive care units (2 academically affiliated and 1 private) in Atlanta, Georgia. Cytomegalovirus serologic testing of enrolled mothers was performed to determine their status. Cytomegalovirus nucleic acid testing (NAT) of transfused blood components and breast milk was performed to identify sources of CMV transmission. A total of 539 VLBW infants (birth weight, </=1500 g) who had not received a blood transfusion were enrolled, with their mothers (n = 462), within 5 days of birth. The infants underwent serum and urine CMV NAT at birth to evaluate congenital infection and surveillance CMV NAT at 5 additional intervals between birth and 90 days, discharge, or death. Exposures: Blood transfusion and breast milk feeding. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative incidence of postnatal CMV infection, detected by serum or urine NAT. Results: The seroprevalence of CMV among the 462 enrolled mothers was 76.2% (n = 352). Among the 539 VLBW infants, the cumulative incidence of postnatal CMV infection at 12 weeks was 6.9% (95% CI, 4.2%-9.2%); 5 of 29 infants (17.2%) with postnatal CMV infection developed symptomatic disease or died. A total of 2061 transfusions were administered among 57.5% (n = 310) of the infants; none of the CMV infections was linked to transfusion, resulting in a CMV infection incidence of 0.0% (95% CI, 0.0%-0.3%) per unit of CMV-seronegative and leukoreduced blood. Twenty-seven of 28 postnatal infections occurred among infants fed CMV-positive breast milk (12-week incidence, 15.3%; 95% CI, 9.3%-20.2%). Conclusions and Relevance: Transfusion of CMV-seronegative and leukoreduced blood products effectively prevents transmission of CMV to VLBW infants. Among infants whose care is managed with this transfusion approach, maternal breast milk is the primary source of postnatal CMV infection.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Composite end point of major cardiovascular events, including nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, and CVD mortality. Secondary outcomes included MI and stroke individually. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 11.2 (interquartile range, 10.7-13.3) years, there were 1732 confirmed major cardiovascular events. Compared with placebo, there was no significant effect of a daily multivitamin on major cardiovascular events (11.0 and 10.8 events per 1000 person-years for multivitamin vs placebo, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.91-1.10; P = .91). Further, a daily multivitamin had no effect on total MI (3.9 and 4.2 events per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.80-1.09; P = .39), total stroke (4.1 and 3.9 events per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.91-1.23; P = .48), or CVD mortality (5.0 and 5.1 events per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83-1.09; P = .47). A daily multivitamin was also not significantly associated with total mortality (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88-1.02; P = .13). The effect of a daily multivitamin on major cardiovascular events did not differ between men with or without a baseline history of CVD (P = .62 for interaction). CONCLUSION: Among this population of US male physicians, taking a daily multivitamin did not reduce major cardiovascular events, MI, stroke, and CVD mortality after more than a decade of treatment and follow-up.

23403597,Influencing self-rated health among adolescent girls with dance intervention: a randomized controlled trial.,JAMA Pediatr,Duberg A and Hagberg L and Sunvisson H and Moller M,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether dance intervention influenced self-rated health for adolescent girls with internalizing problems. DESIGN: Randomized controlled intervention trial with follow-up measures at 8, 12, and 20 months after baseline. SETTING: A Swedish city with a population of 130 000. PARTICIPANTS: Girls aged 13 to 18 years with internalizing problems, ie, stress and psychosomatic symptoms. A total of 59 girls were randomized to the intervention group and 53 were randomized to the control group. INTERVENTION: The intervention comprised dance classes twice weekly during 8 months. Each dance class lasted 75 minutes and the focus was on the joy of movement, not on performance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-rated health was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes were adherence to and experience of the intervention. RESULTS: The dance intervention group improved their self-rated health more than the control group at all follow-ups. At baseline, the mean score on a 5-point scale was 3.32 for the dance intervention group and 3.75 for the control group. The difference in mean change was 0.30 (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.61) at 8 months, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.25 to 0.99) at 12 months, and 0.40 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.77) at 20 months. Among the girls in the intervention group, 67% had an attendance rate of 50% to 100%. A total of 91% of the girls rated the dance intervention as a positive experience. CONCLUSIONS: An 8-month dance intervention can improve self-rated health for adolescent girls with internalizing problems. The improvement remained a year after the intervention.","Adolescent Anxiety/therapy *Dance Therapy/methods Depression/therapy Fatigue/psychology/therapy Female Follow-Up Studies *Health Status Humans Pain/psychology Pain Management Patient Compliance/statistics & numerical data Patient Satisfaction/statistics & numerical data Psychophysiologic Disorders/*therapy Self Report Stress, Psychological/*therapy Treatment Outcome"
24566983,Increased risk of acute cardiovascular events after partner bereavement: a matched cohort study.,JAMA Intern Med,Carey IM and Shah SM and DeWilde S and Harris T and Victor CR and Cook DG,Missing,"IMPORTANCE The period immediately after bereavement has been reported as a time of increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, this risk has not been well quantified, and few large population studies have examined partner bereavement. OBJECTIVE To compare the rate of cardiovascular events between older individuals whose partner dies with those of a matched control group of individuals whose partner was still alive on the same day. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Matched cohort study using a UK primary care database containing availale data of 401 general practices from February 2005 through September 2012. In all, 30 447 individuals aged 60 to 89 years at study initiation who experienced partner bereavement during follow-up were matched by age, sex, and general practice with the nonbereaved control group (n = 83 588) at the time of bereavement. EXPOSURES Partner bereavement. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was occurrence of a fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke within 30 days of bereavement. Secondary outcomes were non-MI acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary embolism. All outcomes were compared between the groups during prespecified periods after bereavement (30, 90, and 365 days). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) from a conditional Poisson model were adjusted for age, smoking status, deprivation, and history of cardiovascular disease. RESULTS Within 30 days of their partner's death, 50 of the bereaved group (0.16%) experienced an MI or a stroke compared with 67 of the matched nonbereaved controls (0.08%) during the same period (IRR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.52-3.15]). The increased risk was seen in bereaved men and women and attenuated after 30 days. For individual outcomes, the increased risk was found separately for MI (IRR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.20-3.81]) and stroke (2.40 [1.22-4.71]). Associations with rarer events were also seen after bereavement, including elevated risk of non-MI acute coronary syndrome (IRR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.12-4.29]) and pulmonary embolism (2.37 [1.18-4.75]) in the first 90 days. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study provides further evidence that the death of a partner is associated with a range of major cardiovascular events in the immediate weeks and months after bereavement. Understanding psychosocial factors associated with acute cardiovascular events may provide opportunities for prevention and improved clinical care.","Acute Coronary Syndrome/epidemiology Aged Aged, 80 and over *Bereavement Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology Case-Control Studies Female Great Britain/epidemiology Humans Male Myocardial Infarction/epidemiology Pulmonary Embolism/epidemiology Risk *Spouses Stroke/epidemiology"
23108571,"Myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death in Olmsted County, Minnesota, before and after smoke-free workplace laws.",Arch Intern Med,Hurt RD and Weston SA and Ebbert JO and McNallan SM and Croghan IT and Schroeder DR and Roger VL,mayo,"BACKGROUND: Reductions in admissions for myocardial infarction (MI) have been reported in locales where smoke-free workplace laws have been implemented, but no study has assessed sudden cardiac death in that setting. In 2002, a smoke-free restaurant ordinance was implemented in Olmsted County, Minnesota, and in 2007, all workplaces, including bars, became smoke free. METHODS: To evaluate the population impact of smoke-free laws, we measured, through the Rochester Epidemiology Project, the incidence of MI and sudden cardiac death in Olmsted County during the 18-month period before and after implementation of each smoke-free ordinance. All MIs were continuously abstracted and validated, using rigorous standardized criteria relying on biomarkers, cardiac pain, and Minnesota coding of the electrocardiogram. Sudden cardiac death was defined as out-of-hospital deaths associated with coronary disease. RESULTS: Comparing the 18 months before implementation of the smoke-free restaurant ordinance with the 18 months after implementation of the smoke-free workplace law, the incidence of MI declined by 33% (P < .001), from 150.8 to 100.7 per 100,000 population, and the incidence of sudden cardiac death declined by 17% (P = .13), from 109.1 to 92.0 per 100,000 population. During the same period, the prevalence of smoking declined and that of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity either remained constant or increased. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial decline in the incidence of MI was observed after smoke-free laws were implemented, the magnitude of which is not explained by community cointerventions or changes in cardiovascular risk factors with the exception of smoking prevalence. As trends in other risk factors do not appear explanatory, smoke-free workplace laws seem to be ecologically related to these favorable trends. Secondhand smoke exposure should be considered a modifiable risk factor for MI. All people should avoid secondhand smoke to the extent possible, and people with coronary heart disease should have no exposure to secondhand smoke.","Aged Death, Sudden, Cardiac/*epidemiology/etiology Female Hospitalization/legislation & jurisprudence Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Minnesota/epidemiology Myocardial Infarction/*epidemiology/etiology Restaurants/legislation & jurisprudence Risk Factors Smoke-Free Policy/*legislation & jurisprudence Smoking/*adverse effects/legislation & jurisprudence Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects/legislation & jurisprudence Workplace/legislation & jurisprudence"
23549584,Melatonin secretion and the incidence of type 2 diabetes.,JAMA,McMullan CJ and Schernhammer ES and Rimm EB and Hu FB and Forman JP,partners,"IMPORTANCE: Loss-of-function mutations in the melatonin receptor are associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, in a cross-sectional analysis of persons without diabetes, lower nocturnal melatonin secretion was associated with increased insulin resistance. OBJECTIVE: To study the association between melatonin secretion and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case-control study nested within the Nurses' Health Study cohort. Among participants without diabetes who provided urine and blood samples at baseline in 2000, we identified 370 women who developed type 2 diabetes from 2000-2012 and matched 370 controls using risk-set sampling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Associations between melatonin secretion at baseline and incidence of type 2 diabetes were evaluated with multivariable conditional logistic regression controlling for demographic characteristics, lifestyle habits, measures of sleep quality, and biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. RESULTS: The median urinary ratios of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin to creatinine were 28.2 ng/mg (5%-95% range, 5.5-84.2 ng/mg) among cases and 36.3 ng/mg (5%-95% range, 6.9-110.8 ng/mg) among controls. Women with lower ratios of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin to creatinine had increased risk of diabetes (multivariable odds ratio, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.11-1.98] per unit decrease in the estimated log ratio of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin to creatinine). Compared with women in the highest ratio category of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin to creatinine, those in the lowest category had a multivariable odds ratio of 2.17 (95% CI, 1.18-3.98) of developing type 2 diabetes. Women in the highest category of melatonin secretion had an estimated diabetes incidence rate of 4.27 cases/1000 person-years compared with 9.27 cases/1000 person-years in the lowest category. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Lower melatonin secretion was independently associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Further research is warranted to assess if melatonin secretion is a modifiable risk factor for diabetes within the general population.","Aged Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies Creatinine/urine Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*epidemiology Female Humans Incidence Melatonin/*analogs & derivatives/*secretion/urine Middle Aged Regression Analysis Risk Factors United States/epidemiology"

24871348,The changing face of heroin use in the United States: a retrospective analysis of the past 50 years.,JAMA Psychiatry,Cicero TJ and Ellis MS and Surratt HL and Kurtz SP,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Over the past several years, there have been a number of mainstream media reports that the abuse of heroin has migrated from low-income urban areas with large minority populations to more affluent suburban and rural areas with primarily white populations. OBJECTIVE: To examine the veracity of these anecdotal reports and define the relationship between the abuse of prescription opioids and the abuse of heroin. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed (1) data from an ongoing study that uses structured, self-administered surveys to gather retrospective data on past drug use patterns among patients entering substance abuse treatment programs across the country who received a primary (DSM-IV) diagnosis of heroin use/dependence (n = 2797) and (2) data from unstructured qualitative interviews with a subset of patients (n = 54) who completed the structured interview. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In addition to data on population demographics and current residential location, we used cross-tabulations to assess prevalence rates as a function of the decade of the initiation of abuse for (1) first opioid used (prescription opioid or heroin), (2) sex, (3) race/ethnicity, and (4) age at first use. Respondents indicated in an open-ended format why they chose heroin as their primary drug and the interrelationship between their use of heroin and their use of prescription opioids. RESULTS: Approximately 85% of treatment-seeking patients approached to complete the Survey of Key Informants' Patients Program did so. Respondents who began using heroin in the 1960s were predominantly young men (82.8%; mean age, 16.5 years) whose first opioid of abuse was heroin (80%). However, more recent users were older (mean age, 22.9 years) men and women living in less urban areas (75.2%) who were introduced to opioids through prescription drugs (75.0%). Whites and nonwhites were equally represented in those initiating use prior to the 1980s, but nearly 90% of respondents who began use in the last decade were white. Although the ""high"" produced by heroin was described as a significant factor in its selection, it was often used because it was more readily accessible and much less expensive than prescription opioids. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our data show that the demographic composition of heroin users entering treatment has shifted over the last 50 years such that heroin use has changed from an inner-city, minority-centered problem to one that has a more widespread geographical distribution, involving primarily white men and women in their late 20s living outside of large urban areas.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors Female Health Surveys/trends Heroin Dependence/economics/*epidemiology/ethnology Humans Interview, Psychological Male Minority Groups Prescription Drugs/*adverse effects/economics Retrospective Studies Sex Factors Time Factors United States/epidemiology/ethnology Urban Population Young Adult"

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether comorbid depression in patients with type 2 diabetes accelerates cognitive decline. DESIGN: A 40-month cohort study of participants in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Memory in Diabetes (ACCORD-MIND) trial. SETTING: Fifty-two clinics organized into 6 clinical networks across the United States and Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand nine hundred seventy-seven participants with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events. INTERVENTION: The Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and the modified Stroop test were used to assess cognition. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire was used to assess depression. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mixed-effects statistical models were used to analyze cognitive test outcomes incorporating depression as a time-dependent covariate. RESULTS: Participants with scores indicative of depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, >/=10) showed greater cognitive decline during 40-month follow-up on all tests, with the following differences in estimated least squares means: Digit Symbol Substitution Test, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.25 to 1.19; P = .003), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, 0.18 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.29; P = .001), and Stroop interference, -1.06 (95% CI, -1.93 to -0.18; P = .02). This effect of depression on risk of cognitive decline did not differ according to previous cardiovascular disease; baseline cognition or age; or intensive vs standard glucose-lowering treatment, blood pressure treatment, lipid treatment, or insulin treatment. Addition of demographic and clinical covariates to models did not significantly change the cognitive decline associated with depression. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Depression in patients with type 2 diabetes was associated with greater cognitive decline in all domains, across all treatment arms, and in all participant subgroups assessed. Future randomized trials will be necessary to determine if depression treatment can lower the risk of cognitive decline in patients with diabetes.","Cardiovascular Diseases/complications/drug therapy/prevention & control Cognition Disorders/*complications/psychology Depression/*complications/psychology Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications/drug therapy/*psychology Female Fenofibrate/therapeutic use Humans Hypolipidemic Agents/therapeutic use Male Models, Statistical Neuropsychological Tests"
24227182,Longitudinal pattern of depressive symptoms around natural menopause.,JAMA Psychiatry,Freeman EW and Sammel MD and Boorman DW and Zhang R,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: An increased risk of depressive symptoms has been associated with the transition to menopause, but the risk of depressive symptoms in the early postmenopausal years has not been well characterized. OBJECTIVES: To identify within-woman changes in depressive symptoms during a 14-year period around menopause, determine associations of a history of depression with the pattern of depressive symptoms, and evaluate the rate of change in reproductive hormones as predictors of depressive symptoms following menopause. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomly identified, population-based sample in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, of 203 late-reproductive-age women who were premenopausal at baseline and reached natural menopause. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. RESULTS: The prevalence of high scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale decreased from 10 years before to 8 years after the final menstrual period (FMP), with a decrease of approximately 15% of baseline per year (odds ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.81-0.89; P < .001). Relative to the FMP, the risk of depressive symptoms was higher in the years before and lower in the years after the FMP. Among women with a history of depression, the likelihood of depressive symptoms was more than 13 times greater overall and 8 times greater after menopause compared with women with no depression history. Among women who first experienced depressive symptoms approaching menopause, the risk of depressive symptoms declined after the FMP, with a significantly lower risk the second year after menopause. The risk of depressive symptoms after menopause decreased by 35% for each unit (SD) increase before the FMP in the log rate of change of follicle-stimulating hormone (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.91; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The FMP was pivotal in the overall pattern of decreasing depressive symptoms in midlife women, with higher risk before and lower risk after the FMP. A history of depression strongly increased the risk both before and after menopause. Women who had no history of depression before the menopause transition had a low risk of depressive symptoms 2 or more years after the FMP.",Adult Depression/*etiology/physiopathology Estradiol/blood Female Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood Humans Inhibins/blood Longitudinal Studies Menopause/physiology/*psychology Middle Aged Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Risk Factors

However, the mechanisms and temporal sequence underlying this association are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the subtypes of major depressive disorder (MDD; melancholic, atypical, combined, or unspecified) are predictive of adiposity in terms of the incidence of obesity and changes in body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), waist circumference, and fat mass. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective population-based cohort study, CoLaus (Cohorte Lausannoise)/PsyCoLaus (Psychiatric arm of the CoLaus Study), with 5.5 years of follow-up included 3054 randomly selected residents (mean age, 49.7 years; 53.1% were women) of the city of Lausanne, Switzerland (according to the civil register), aged 35 to 66 years in 2003, who accepted the physical and psychiatric baseline and physical follow-up evaluations. EXPOSURES: Depression subtypes according to the DSM-IV. Diagnostic criteria at baseline and follow-up, as well as sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle (alcohol and tobacco use and physical activity), and medication, were elicited using the semistructured Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in body mass index, waist circumference, and fat mass during the follow-up period, in percentage of the baseline value, and the incidence of obesity during the follow-up period among nonobese participants at baseline. Weight, height, waist circumference, and body fat (bioimpedance) were measured at baseline and follow-up by trained field interviewers. RESULTS: Only participants with the atypical subtype of MDD at baseline revealed a higher increase in adiposity during follow-up than participants without MDD. The associations between this MDD subtype and body mass index (beta = 3.19; 95% CI, 1.50-4.88), incidence of obesity (odds ratio, 3.75; 95% CI, 1.24-11.35), waist circumference in both sexes (beta = 2.44; 95% CI, 0.21-4.66), and fat mass in men (beta = 16.36; 95% CI, 4.81-27.92) remained significant after adjustments for a wide range of possible cofounding. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The atypical subtype of MDD is a strong predictor of obesity. This emphasizes the need to identify individuals with this subtype of MDD in both clinical and research settings. Therapeutic measures to diminish the consequences of increased appetite during depressive episodes with atypical features are advocated.",Missing
2013,"Rapid infusion of sodium bicarbonate and albumin into high-risk premature infants soon after birth: a controlled, prospective trial.",Am J Obstet Gynecol,Bland RD and Clarke TL and Harden LB,Missing,"We conducted a controlled, prospective trial to evaluate the effectiveness of rapidly infusing sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and salt-poor albumin into high-risk, premature infants in the first 2 hours of life. Fifty-three infants, randomized into one of four treatment groups, received 8 ml. per kilogram of a solution containing either (A) glucose in water, (B) salt-poor albumin, (C) NaHCO3, or (D) a combination of albumin and NaHCO3. After the initial infusion, the babies received no colloid or alkali solutions until 4 hours of age. We managed them supportively with warmth, appropriate oxygen administration, isotonic fluid infusion, and close monitoring. Among the infants who received alkali, 14 of 26 acquired the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 11 died, and four had intracranial hemorrhage. Among babies who received no alkali, RDS occurred in 11 of 27, 5 died, and none had intracranial hemorrhage. These results do not support the common practice of rapidly infusing NaHCO3 into high-risk, premature infants, and they suggest that the early management of such infants needs renewed critical evaluation.","Acidosis/*drug therapy Albumins/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Bicarbonates/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Carbon Dioxide/blood Cerebral Hemorrhage/mortality Female Hawaii Humans Hydrogen-Ion Concentration Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature, Diseases/blood/*drug therapy/mortality Infusions, Parenteral Male Prospective Studies Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/mortality Sodium/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Time Factors"

OBJECTIVES To determine the safety and efficacy of dietary flaxseed supplementation in the management of hypercholesterolemia in children. DESIGN Four-week placebo-controlled, blinded, randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Specialized dyslipidemia clinic at a tertiary pediatric care center. PARTICIPANTS Thirty-two participants aged 8 to 18 years with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from 135 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L) to less than 193 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L). INTERVENTION: The intervention group ate 2 muffins and 1 slice of bread daily containing ground flaxseed (30 g flaxseed total). The control group ate muffins and bread substituted with whole-wheat flour. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Attributable change in fasting lipid profile. RESULTS Dietary flaxseed supplementation resulted in an attributable decrease of -7.35 mg/dL (-0.19 mmol/L) in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (95% CI, -3.09 to -11.60 mg/dL[-0.08 to -0.30 mmol/L]; relative: -15%, 95% CI, -24% to -6%; P = .001), an increase of 29.23 mg/dL (+0.33 mmol/L) in triglycerides (95% CI, 4.43 to 53.14 mg/dL [+0.05 to +0.60 mmol/L]; relative: +26%, 95% CI, +4% to +48%; P = .02), and an increase of +4.88 g/d in dietary polyunsaturated fat intake (95% CI, +0.22 to +9.53; relative: +76%, 95% CI, +3% to +148%; P = .04). Flaxseed had no attributable effects on total cholesterol (-8.51 mg/dL [-0.22 mmol/L]; 95% CI, -21.66 to 4.25 mg/dL [-0.56 to +0.11 mmol/L]; relative: -4%, 95% CI, -10% to +2%; P = .20), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-6.96 mg/dL [-0.18 mmol/L]; 95% CI, -16.63 to 2.71 mg/dL [-0.43 to +0.07 mmol/L]; relative: -5%, 95% CI, -12% to +2%; P = .15), body mass index z score (+0.002; 95% CI, -0.147 to +0.150; relative: +0%, 95% CI, -12% to +12%; P = .30), or total caloric intake (+117 kcal; 95% CI, -243 to +479; relative: +8%, 95% CI, -17% to +33%; P = .52). An attributable change in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol failed to exclude a potential benefit of flaxseed supplementation based on a prespecified minimum clinically important reduction of 10%. No concerns were noted regarding safety. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The use of dietary flaxseed supplementation, while safe, was associated with adverse changes in the lipid profile of children with hypercholesterolemia, although a potential benefit of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering could not be excluded. The use of flaxseed supplementation in children with hypercholesterolemia might not be a viable option for lipid management in this population.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationships of concussion history and years of football experience with hippocampal volume and cognitive performance in collegiate football athletes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study conducted between June 2011 and August 2013 at a US psychiatric research institute specializing in neuroimaging among collegiate football players with a history of clinician-diagnosed concussion (n = 25), collegiate football players without a history of concussion (n = 25), and non-football-playing, age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (n = 25). EXPOSURES: History of clinician-diagnosed concussion and years of football experience. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: High-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify brain volumes. Baseline scores on a computerized concussion-related cognitive battery were used for cognitive assessment in athletes. RESULTS: Players with and without a history of concussion had smaller hippocampal volumes relative to healthy control participants (with concussion: t48 = 7.58; P < .001; mean difference, 1788 muL; 95% CI, 1317-2258 muL; without concussion: t48 = 4.35; P < .001, mean difference, 1027 muL; 95% CI, 556-1498 muL). Players with a history of concussion had smaller hippocampal volumes than players without concussion (t48 = 3.15; P < .001; mean difference, 761 muL; 95% CI, 280-1242 muL).

All patients received follow-up through December 31, 2009, and the black case patients were matched to 3 white control populations on demographics (age, year of diagnosis, and SEER site), presentation (demographics variables plus patient comorbid conditions and tumor characteristics such as stage, size, grade, and estrogen receptor status), and treatment (presentation variables plus details of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 5-Year survival. RESULTS: The absolute difference in 5-year survival (blacks, 55.9%; whites, 68.8%) was 12.9% (95% CI, 11.5%-14.5%; P < .001) in the demographics match. This difference remained unchanged between 1991 and 2005. After matching on presentation characteristics, the absolute difference in 5-year survival was 4.4% (95% CI, 2.8%-5.8%; P < .001) and was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.3%-4.9%; P < .001) lower for blacks than for whites matched also on treatment. In the presentation match, fewer blacks received treatment (87.4% vs 91.8%; P < .001), time from diagnosis to treatment was longer (29.2 vs 22.8 days; P < .001), use of anthracyclines and taxols was lower (3.7% vs 5.0%; P < .001), and breast-conserving surgery without other treatment was more frequent (8.2% vs 7.3%; P = .04). Nevertheless, differences in survival associated with treatment differences accounted for only 0.81% of the 12.9% survival difference. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the SEER-Medicare database, differences in breast cancer survival between black and white women did not substantially change among women diagnosed between 1991 and 2005. These differences in survival appear primarily related to presentation characteristics at diagnosis rather than treatment differences.",African Continental Ancestry Group/*statistics & numerical data Aged Breast Neoplasms/*ethnology/*mortality/therapy Case-Control Studies European Continental Ancestry Group/*statistics & numerical data Female *Health Status Disparities *Healthcare Disparities Humans Medicare/statistics & numerical data SEER Program/statistics & numerical data Survival Analysis United States

OBJECTIVES To analyze the most common initial symptoms in patients with OPSCC and to determine if any differences in initial symptoms occur between HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Retrospective single-institution review of medical records of previously untreated patients with OPSCC diagnosed from January 1, 2008, toMay 20, 2013, who were evaluated by 1 physician (the senior author, T.A.D.) at the Medical University of South Carolina. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We determined the most common initial symptoms of OPSCC and analyzed differences between HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors. RESULTS Neck mass (in 39 patients [44%]) and sore throat (in 29 patients [33%]) comprised the most common initial symptoms in OPSCC. Patients who were HPV-positive were more likely to initially notice a neck mass than HPV-negative patients (51% vs 18%; P = .02), whereas HPV-negative patients were more likely to notice sore throat (53%vs 28%; P = .09), dysphagia (41% vs 10%; P = .05), or odynophagia (24%vs 6%; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study provides preliminary evidence supporting neck mass and sore throat as the initial symptoms of patients with OPSCC. Patients who were HPV-positive more commonly complained of a neck mass as the initial symptom, whereas HPV-negative patients more commonly had symptoms related to the primary tumor site, including sore throat, dysphagia, and/or odynophagia.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antibodies, Viral/*analysis Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*diagnosis/virology Diagnosis, Differential Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Middle Aged Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/virology Papillomaviridae/*immunology Papillomavirus Infections/*diagnosis/virology Prognosis Retrospective Studies Young Adult"

The epidemiology of discontinued RCTs, however, remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence, characteristics, and publication history of discontinued RCTs and to investigate factors associated with RCT discontinuation due to poor recruitment and with nonpublication. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cohort of RCTs based on archived protocols approved by 6 research ethics committees in Switzerland, Germany, and Canada between 2000 and 2003. We recorded trial characteristics and planned recruitment from included protocols. Last follow-up of RCTs was April 27, 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Completion status, reported reasons for discontinuation, and publication status of RCTs as determined by correspondence with the research ethics committees, literature searches, and investigator surveys. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 11.6 years (range, 8.8-12.6 years), 253 of 1017 included RCTs were discontinued (24.9% [95% CI, 22.3%-27.6%]). Only 96 of 253 discontinuations (37.9% [95% CI, 32.0%-44.3%]) were reported to ethics committees. The most frequent reason for discontinuation was poor recruitment (101/1017; 9.9% [95% CI, 8.2%-12.0%]). In multivariable analysis, industry sponsorship vs investigator sponsorship (8.4% vs 26.5%; odds ratio [OR], 0.25 [95% CI, 0.15-0.43]; P < .001) and a larger planned sample size in increments of 100 (-0.7%; OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.92-1.00]; P = .04) were associated with lower rates of discontinuation due to poor recruitment. Discontinued trials were more likely to remain unpublished than completed trials (55.1% vs 33.6%; OR, 3.19 [95% CI, 2.29-4.43]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this sample of trials based on RCT protocols from 6 research ethics committees, discontinuation was common, with poor recruitment being the most frequently reported reason. Greater efforts are needed to ensure the reporting of trial discontinuation to research ethics committees and the publication of results of discontinued trials.","Canada Cohort Studies Ethics Committees, Research Germany Humans Odds Ratio Patient Selection *Publication Bias *Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/ethics/statistics & numerical data Retrospective Studies Switzerland"

OBJECTIVE: To compare rates of recovery in patients with remitted FEP after 7 years of follow-up of a dose reduction/discontinuation (DR) vs maintenance treatment (MT) trial. DESIGN: Seven-year follow-up of a 2-year open randomized clinical trial comparing MT and DR. SETTING: One hundred twenty-eight patients participating in the original trial were recruited from 257 patients with FEP referred from October 2001 to December 2002 to 7 mental health care services in a 3.2 million-population catchment area. Of these, 111 patients refused to participate and 18 patients did not experience remission. PARTICIPANTS After 7 years, 103 patients (80.5%) of 128 patients who were included in the original trial were located and consented to follow-up assessment. INTERVENTION: After 6 months of remission, patients were randomly assigned to DR strategy or MT for 18 months. After the trial, treatment was at the discretion of the clinician. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was rate of recovery, defined as meeting the criteria of symptomatic and functional remission. Determinants of recovery were examined using logistic regression analysis; the treatment strategy (MT or DR) was controlled for baseline parameters. RESULTS: The DR patients experienced twice the recovery rate of the MT patients (40.4% vs 17.6%). Logistic regression showed an odds ratio of 3.49 (P = .01). Better DR recovery rates were related to higher functional remission rates in the DR group but were not related to symptomatic remission rates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Dose reduction/discontinuation of antipsychotics during the early stages of remitted FEP shows superior long-term recovery rates compared with the rates achieved with MT. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing long-term gains of an early-course DR strategy in patients with remitted FEP. Additional studies are necessary before these results are incorporated into general practice.

24247817,Milk consumption during teenage years and risk of hip fractures in older adults.,JAMA Pediatr,Feskanich D and Bischoff-Ferrari HA and Frazier AL and Willett WC,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Milk consumption during adolescence is recommended to promote peak bone mass and thereby reduce fracture risk in later life. However, its role in hip fracture prevention is not established and high consumption may adversely influence risk by increasing height. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether milk consumption during teenage years influences risk of hip fracture in older adults and to investigate the role of attained height in this association. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study over 22 years of follow-up in more than 96,000 white postmenopausal women from the Nurses' Health Study and men aged 50 years and older from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study in the United States. EXPOSURES: Frequency of consumption of milk and other foods during ages 13 to 18 years and attained height were reported at baseline. Current diet, weight, smoking, physical activity, medication use, and other risk factors for hip fractures were reported on biennial questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) of first incidence of hip fracture from low-trauma events per glass (8 fl oz or 240 mL) of milk consumed per day during teenage years. RESULTS: During follow-up, 1226 hip fractures were identified in women and 490 in men. After controlling for known risk factors and current milk consumption, each additional glass of milk per day during teenage years was associated with a significant 9% higher risk of hip fracture in men (RR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17). The association was attenuated when height was added to the model (RR = 1.06; 95% CI, 0.98-1.14). Teenage milk consumption was not associated with hip fractures in women (RR = 1.00 per glass per day; 95% CI, 0.95-1.05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Greater milk consumption during teenage years was not associated with a lower risk of hip fracture in older adults.

23636710,A prospective assessment of reports of drinking to self-medicate mood symptoms with the incidence and persistence of alcohol dependence.,JAMA Psychiatry,Crum RM and Mojtabai R and Lazareck S and Bolton JM and Robinson J and Sareen J and Green KM and Stuart EA and La Flair L and Alvanzo AA and Storr CL,jhsph,"IMPORTANCE: Mood disorders and alcohol dependence frequently co-occur. Etiologic theories concerning the comorbidity often focus on drinking to self-medicate or cope with affective symptoms. However, there have been few, if any, prospective studies in population-based samples of alcohol self-medication of mood symptoms with the occurrence of alcohol dependence. Furthermore, it is not known whether these associations are affected by treatment or symptom severity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that alcohol self-medication of mood symptoms increases the probability of subsequent onset and the persistence or chronicity of alcohol dependence. DESIGN: Prospective study using face-to-face interviews-the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. SETTING: Nationally representative survey of the US population. PARTICIPANTS: Drinkers at risk for alcohol dependence among the 43 093 adults surveyed in 2001 and 2002 (wave 1); 34 653 of whom were reinterviewed in 2004 and 2005 (wave 2). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association of alcohol self-medication of mood symptoms with incident and persistent DSM-IV alcohol dependence using logistic regression and the propensity score method of inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: The report of alcohol self-medication of mood symptoms was associated with an increased odds of incident alcohol dependence at follow-up (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.10; 95% CI, 1.55-6.19; P = .002) and persistence of dependence (AOR, 3.45; 95% CI, 2.35-5.08; P < .001). The population-attributable fraction was 11.9% (95% CI, 6.7%-16.9%) for incident dependence and 30.6% (95% CI, 24.8%-36.0%) for persistent dependence. Stratified analyses were conducted by age, sex, race/ethnicity, mood symptom severity, and treatment history for mood symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Drinking to alleviate mood symptoms is associated with the development of alcohol dependence and its persistence once dependence develops. These associations occur among individuals with subthreshold mood symptoms, with DSM-IV affective disorders, and for those who have received treatment. Drinking to self-medicate mood symptoms may be a potential target for prevention and early intervention efforts aimed at reducing the occurrence of alcohol dependence.",Adolescent Adult Alcohol Drinking/*epidemiology/*psychology Alcoholism/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*psychology Comorbidity Female Health Surveys Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Mood Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*psychology Prospective Studies Risk Factors Self Medication/*psychology United States/epidemiology

LPS is a major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and is a potent activator of the acute inflammatory response. OBJECTIVE: To determine if eritoran, a TLR4 antagonist, would significantly reduce sepsis-induced mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational phase 3 trial in 197 intensive care units. Patients were enrolled from June 2006 to September 2010 and final follow-up was completed in September 2011. INTERVENTIONS: Patients with severe sepsis (n = 1961) were randomized and treated within 12 hours of onset of first organ dysfunction in a 2:1 ratio with a 6-day course of either eritoran tetrasodium (105 mg total) or placebo, with n = 1304 and n = 657 patients, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was 28-day all-cause mortality. The secondary end points were all-cause mortality at 3, 6, and 12 months after beginning treatment. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the 2 study groups were similar. In the modified intent-to-treat analysis (randomized patients who received at least 1 dose) there was no significant difference in the primary end point of 28-day all-cause mortality with 28.1% (366/1304) in the eritoran group vs 26.9% (177/657) in the placebo group (P = .59; hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.88-1.26; difference in mortality rate, -1.1; 95% CI, -5.3 to 3.1) or in the key secondary end point of 1-year all-cause mortality with 44.1% (290/657) in the eritoran group vs 43.3% (565/1304) in the placebo group, Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to death by 1 year, P = .79 (hazard ratio, 0.98; 0.85-1.13). No significant differences were observed in any of the prespecified subgroups. Adverse events, including secondary infection rates, did not differ between study groups.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of everolimus in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma for whom sorafenib treatment failed. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: EVOLVE-1 was a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study conducted among 546 adults with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C hepatocellular carcinoma and Child-Pugh A liver function whose disease progressed during or after sorafenib or who were intolerant of sorafenib. Patients were enrolled from 17 countries between May 2010 and March 2012. Randomization was stratified by region (Asia vs rest of world) and macrovascular invasion (present vs absent). INTERVENTIONS: Everolimus, 7.5 mg/d, or matching placebo, both given in combination with best supportive care and continued until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Per the 2:1 randomization scheme, 362 patients were randomized to the everolimus group and 184 patients to the placebo group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points included time to progression and the disease control rate (the percentage of patients with a best overall response of complete or partial response or stable disease). RESULTS: No significant difference in overall survival was seen between treatment groups, with 303 deaths (83.7%) in the everolimus group and 151 deaths (82.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% CI, 0.86-1.27; P = .68; median overall survival, 7.6 months with everolimus, 7.3 months with placebo). Median time to progression with everolimus and placebo was 3.0 months and 2.6 months, respectively (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.75-1.15), and disease control rate was 56.1% and 45.1%, respectively (P = .01). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events for everolimus vs placebo were anemia (7.8% vs 3.3%, respectively), asthenia (7.8% vs 5.5%, respectively), and decreased appetite (6.1% vs 0.5%, respectively). No patients experienced hepatitis C viral flare. Based on central laboratory results, hepatitis B viral reactivation was experienced by 39 patients (29 everolimus, 10 placebo); all cases were asymptomatic, but 3 everolimus recipients discontinued therapy.

In clinical practice, patients often receive dual-chamber ICDs, even without clear indications for pacing. The outcomes of dual- vs single-chamber devices are uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes of single- and dual-chamber ICDs for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of admissions in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry's (NCDR) ICD registry from 2006-2009 that could be linked to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services fee-for-service Medicare claims data. Patients were included if they received an ICD for primary prevention and did not have a documented indication for pacing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted risks of 1-year mortality, all-cause readmission, heart failure readmission, and device-related complications within 90 days were estimated with propensity-score matching based on patient, clinician, and hospital factors. RESULTS: Among 32,034 patients, 12,246 (38%) received a single-chamber device and 19,788 (62%) received a dual-chamber device. In a propensity-matched cohort, rates of complications were lower for single-chamber devices (3.51% vs 4.72%; P < .001; risk difference, -1.20 [95% CI, -1.72 to -0.69]), but device type was not significantly associated with 1-year mortality (unadjusted rate, 9.85% vs 9.77%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.99 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.07]; P = .79), 1-year all-cause hospitalization (unadjusted rate, 43.86% vs 44.83%; HR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.97-1.04]; P = .82), or hospitalization for heart failure (unadjusted rate, 14.73% vs 15.38%; HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.99-1.12]; P = .19). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients receiving an ICD for primary prevention without indications for pacing, the use of a dual-chamber device compared with a single-chamber device was associated with a higher risk of device-related complications and similar 1-year mortality and hospitalization outcomes.

24061708,Influence of bedsharing activity on breastfeeding duration among US mothers.,JAMA Pediatr,Huang Y and Hauck FR and Signore C and Yu A and Raju TN and Huang TT and Fein SB,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Some professional associations advocate bedsharing to facilitate breastfeeding, while others recommend against it to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome and suffocation deaths. A better understanding of the quantitative influence of bedsharing on breastfeeding duration is needed to guide policy. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the influence of bedsharing on breastfeeding duration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal data were from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II, which enrolled mothers while pregnant and followed them through the first year of infant life. Questionnaires were sent at infant ages 1 to 7, 9, 10, and 12 months, and 1846 mothers answered at least 1 question regarding bedsharing and were breastfeeding at infant age 2 weeks. EXPOSURES: Bedsharing, defined as the mother lying down and sleeping with her infant on the same bed or other sleeping surfaces for nighttime sleep or during the major sleep period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Survival analysis to investigate the effect of bedsharing on duration of any and exclusive breastfeeding. RESULTS: Longer duration of bedsharing, indicated by a larger cumulative bedsharing score, was associated with a longer duration of any breastfeeding but not exclusive breastfeeding, after adjusting for covariates. Breastfeeding duration was longer among women who were better educated, were white, had previously breastfed, had planned to breastfeed, and had not returned to work in the first year postpartum. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Multiple factors were associated with breastfeeding, including bedsharing. Given the risk of sudden infant death syndrome related to bedsharing, multipronged strategies to promote breastfeeding should be developed and tested.","Adult Beds Breast Feeding/*statistics & numerical data Female Humans Infant *Infant Care/trends Infant, Newborn Multivariate Analysis *Sleep Socioeconomic Factors Time Factors United States"

OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects of an intervention to promote increased duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding on child adiposity and circulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, which regulates growth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster-randomized controlled trial in 31 Belarusian maternity hospitals and their affiliated clinics, randomized into 1 of 2 groups: breastfeeding promotion intervention (n = 16) or usual practices (n = 15). Participants were 17,046 breastfeeding mother-infant pairs enrolled in 1996 and 1997, of whom 13,879 (81.4%) were followed up between January 2008 and December 2010 at a median age of 11.5 years. INTERVENTION: Breastfeeding promotion intervention modeled on the WHO/UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (World Health Organization/United Nations Children's Fund). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body mass index (BMI), fat and fat-free mass indices (FMI and FFMI), percent body fat, waist circumference, triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses, overweight and obesity, and whole-blood IGF-I. Primary analysis was based on modified intention-to-treat (without imputation), accounting for clustering within hospitals and clinics. RESULTS: The experimental intervention substantially increased breastfeeding duration and exclusivity when compared with the control (43% vs 6% exclusively breastfed at 3 months and 7.9% vs 0.6% at 6 months). Cluster-adjusted mean differences in outcomes at 11.5 years of age between experimental vs control groups were: 0.19 (95% CI, -0.09 to 0.46) for BMI; 0.12 (-0.03 to 0.28) for FMI; 0.04 (-0.11 to 0.18) for FFMI; 0.47% (-0.11% to 1.05%) for percent body fat; 0.30 cm (-1.41 to 2.01) for waist circumference; -0.07 mm (-1.71 to 1.57) for triceps and -0.02 mm (-0.79 to 0.75) for subscapular skinfold thicknesses; and -0.02 standard deviations (-0.12 to 0.08) for IGF-I. The cluster-adjusted odds ratio for overweight/obesity (BMI >/= 85th vs <85th percentile) was 1.18 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.39) and for obesity (BMI >/= 95th vs <85th percentile) was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.41). CONCLUSIONS: AND RELEVANCE Among healthy term infants in Belarus, an intervention that succeeded in improving the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding did not prevent overweight or obesity, nor did it affect IGF-I levels at age 11.5 years. Breastfeeding has many advantages but population strategies to increase the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding are unlikely to curb the obesity epidemic.

In 2011, current cigarette smokers who had ever used e-cigarettes were more likely to intend to quit smoking within the next year (OR = 1.53; 95% CI, 1.03-2.28). Among experimenters with conventional cigarettes, ever use of e-cigarettes was associated with lower 30-day (OR = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.21-0.28), 6-month (OR = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.21-0.28), and 1-year (OR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.21-0.30) abstinence from cigarettes. Current e-cigarette use was also associated with lower 30-day (OR = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.08-0.15), 6-month (OR = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.08-0.15), and 1-year (OR = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.07-0.18) abstinence. Among ever smokers of cigarettes (100 cigarettes), ever e-cigarette use was negatively associated with 30-day (OR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.89), 6-month (OR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33-0.83), and 1-year (OR = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18-0.56) abstinence from conventional cigarettes. Current e-cigarette use was also negatively associated with 30-day (OR = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.18-0.69), 6-month (OR = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13-0.68), and 1-year (OR = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13-0.87) abstinence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Use of e-cigarettes was associated with higher odds of ever or current cigarette smoking, higher odds of established smoking, higher odds of planning to quit smoking among current smokers, and, among experimenters, lower odds of abstinence from conventional cigarettes.

23942679,Association between early surgical intervention vs watchful waiting and outcomes for mitral regurgitation due to flail mitral valve leaflets.,JAMA,Suri RM and Vanoverschelde JL and Grigioni F and Schaff HV and Tribouilloy C and Avierinos JF and Barbieri A and Pasquet A and Huebner M and Rusinaru D and Russo A and Michelena HI and Enriquez-Sarano M,mayo,"IMPORTANCE: The optimal management of severe mitral valve regurgitation in patients without class I triggers (heart failure symptoms or left ventricular dysfunction) remains controversial in part due to the poorly defined long-term consequences of current management strategies. In the absence of clinical trial data, analysis of large multicenter registries is critical. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the comparative effectiveness of initial medical management (nonsurgical observation) vs early mitral valve surgery following the diagnosis of mitral regurgitation due to flail leaflets. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Mitral Regurgitation International Database (MIDA) registry includes 2097 consecutive patients with flail mitral valve regurgitation (1980-2004) receiving routine cardiac care from 6 tertiary centers (France, Italy, Belgium, and the United States). Mean follow-up was 10.3 years and was 98% complete. Of 1021 patients with mitral regurgitation without the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) guideline class I triggers, 575 patients were initially medically managed and 446 underwent mitral valve surgery within 3 months following detection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association between treatment strategy and survival, heart failure, and new-onset atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in early mortality (1.1% for early surgery vs 0.5% for medical management, P=.28) and new-onset heart failure rates (0.9% for early surgery vs 0.9% for medical management, P=.96) between treatment strategies at 3 months. In contrast, long-term survival rates were higher for patients with early surgery (86% vs 69% at 10 years, P < .001), which was confirmed in adjusted models (hazard ratio [HR], 0.55 [95% CI, 0.41-0.72], P < .001), a propensity-matched cohort (32 variables; HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.35-0.79], P = .002), and an inverse probability-weighted analysis (HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.52-0.83], P < .001), associated with a 5-year reduction in mortality of 52.6% (P < .001). Similar results were observed in relative reduction in mortality following early surgery in the subset with class II triggers (59.3 after 5 years, P = .002). Long-term heart failure risk was also lower with early surgery (7% vs 23% at 10 years, P < .001), which was confirmed in risk-adjusted models (HR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.19-0.43], P < .001), a propensity-matched cohort (HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.26-0.76], P = .003), and in the inverse probability-weighted analysis (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.36-0.72], P < .001). Reduction in late-onset atrial fibrillation was not observed (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.64-1.13], P = .26). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among registry patients with mitral valve regurgitation due to flail mitral leaflets, performance of early mitral surgery compared with initial medical management was associated with greater long-term survival and a lower risk of heart failure, with no difference in new-onset atrial fibrillation.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Atrial Fibrillation/epidemiology Databases, Factual Europe/epidemiology Female Follow-Up Studies Heart Failure/epidemiology Humans Male Middle Aged Mitral Valve/*pathology Mitral Valve Insufficiency/*mortality/*surgery Registries Risk Survival Analysis Time Factors Treatment Outcome United States/epidemiology *Watchful Waiting"
23780461,Time to treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and outcome from acute ischemic stroke.,JAMA,Saver JL and Fonarow GC and Smith EE and Reeves MJ and Grau-Sepulveda MV and Pan W and Olson DM and Hernandez AF and Peterson ED and Schwamm LH,ucla,"IMPORTANCE: Randomized clinical trials suggest the benefit of intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in acute ischemic stroke is time dependent. However, modest sample sizes have limited characterization of the extent to which onset to treatment (OTT) time influences outcome; and the generalizability of findings to clinical practice is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the degree to which OTT time is associated with outcome among patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intraveneous tPA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Data were analyzed from 58,353 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with tPA within 4.5 hours of symptom onset in 1395 hospitals participating in the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Program, April 2003 to March 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Relationship between OTT time and in-hospital mortality, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, ambulatory status at discharge, and discharge destination. RESULTS: Among the 58,353 tPA-treated patients, median age was 72 years, 50.3% were women, median OTT time was 144 minutes (interquartile range, 115-170), 9.3% (5404) had OTT time of 0 to 90 minutes, 77.2% (45,029) had OTT time of 91 to 180 minutes, and 13.6% (7920) had OTT time of 181 to 270 minutes. Median pretreatment National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale documented in 87.7% of patients was 11 (interquartile range, 6-17). Patient factors most strongly associated with shorter OTT included greater stroke severity (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% CI, 2.5-3.1 per 5-point increase), arrival by ambulance (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 4.5-7.3), and arrival during regular hours (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 3.8-5.4). Overall, there were 5142 (8.8%) in-hospital deaths, 2873 (4.9%) patients had intracranial hemorrhage, 19,491 (33.4%) patients achieved independent ambulation at hospital discharge, and 22,541 (38.6%) patients were discharged to home. Faster OTT, in 15-minute increments, was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98; P < .001), reduced symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98; P < .001), increased achievement of independent ambulation at discharge (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.05; P < .001), and increased discharge to home (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a registry representing US clinical practice, earlier thrombolytic treatment was associated with reduced mortality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and higher rates of independent ambulation at discharge and discharge to home following acute ischemic stroke. These findings support intensive efforts to accelerate hospital presentation and thrombolytic treatment in patients with stroke.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Brain Ischemia/*drug therapy Female Fibrinolytic Agents/*administration & dosage Health Status Hospital Mortality Humans Infusions, Intravenous Male Middle Aged Patient Discharge/statistics & numerical data Registries Retrospective Studies Severity of Illness Index Stroke/*drug therapy/mortality/physiopathology Time Factors Tissue Plasminogen Activator/*administration & dosage Treatment Outcome United States/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether early, short-term, or cumulative exposures to episodes of infection and fever during the first 3 years of life were associated with the initiation of persistent islet autoimmunity in children at increased T1D risk. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with daily infection records and regular assessment of islet autoimmunity. SETTING: Diabetes Research Institute, Munich, Germany. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 148 children at high T1D risk with documentation of 1245 infectious events in 90,750 person-days during their first 3 years of life. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hazard ratios (HRs) for seroconversion to persistent islet autoantibodies were assessed in Cox regression models with numbers of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and other infections, adjusting for sex, delivery mode, intervention group, season of birth, and antibiotic use. RESULTS: An increased HR of islet autoantibody seroconversion was associated with respiratory infections during the first 6 months of life (HR = 2.27; 95% CI, 1.32-3.91) and ages 6.0 to 11.9 months (HR = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.61). During the second year of life, no meaningful effects were detected for any infectious category. A higher number of respiratory infections in the 6 months prior to islet autoantibody seroconversion was also associated with an increased HR (HR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.12-1.80).

OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between perinatal and infant exposures, especially early infant diet, and the development of T1DM. DESIGN: The Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) is a longitudinal, observational study. SETTING: Newborn screening for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) was done at St. Joseph's Hospital in Denver, Colorado. First-degree relatives of individuals with T1DM were recruited from the Denver metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1835 children at increased genetic risk for T1DM followed up from birth with complete prospective assessment of infant diet. Fifty-three children developed T1DM. EXPOSURES: Early (<4 months of age) and late (>/=6 months of age) first exposure to solid foods compared with first exposures at 4 to 5 months of age (referent). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Risk for T1DM diagnosed by a physician. RESULTS: Both early and late first exposure to any solid food predicted development of T1DM (hazard ratio [HR], 1.91; 95% CI, 1.04-3.51, and HR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.26-7.24, respectively), adjusting for the HLA-DR genotype, first-degree relative with T1DM, maternal education, and delivery type. Specifically, early exposure to fruit and late exposure to rice/oat predicted T1DM (HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.14-4.39, and HR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.36-6.11, respectively), while breastfeeding at the time of introduction to wheat/barley conferred protection (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.26-0.86). Complicated vaginal delivery was also a predictor of T1DM (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.03-3.61). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest the safest age to introduce solid foods in children at increased genetic risk for T1DM is between 4 and 5 months of age. Breastfeeding while introducing new foods may reduce T1DM risk.","Breast Feeding Child Child, Preschool Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*etiology/genetics *Diet Diet Surveys *Feeding Behavior Female Genetic Markers HLA-DQ beta-Chains/genetics HLA-DR3 Antigen/genetics HLA-DR4 Antigen/genetics Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Longitudinal Studies Male Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Risk Factors"

23695482,Effect of early vs late tracheostomy placement on survival in patients receiving mechanical ventilation: the TracMan randomized trial.,JAMA,Young D and Harrison DA and Cuthbertson BH and Rowan K,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Tracheostomy is a widely used intervention in adult critical care units. There is little evidence to guide clinicians regarding the optimal timing for this procedure. OBJECTIVE: To test whether early vs late tracheostomy would be associated with lower mortality in adult patients requiring mechanical ventilation in critical care units. DESIGN AND SETTING: An open multicentered randomized clinical trial conducted between 2004 and 2011 involving 70 adult general and 2 cardiothoracic critical care units in 13 university and 59 nonuniversity hospitals in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Of 1032 eligible patients, 909 adult patients breathing with the aid of mechanical ventilation for less than 4 days and identified by the treating physician as likely to require at least 7 more days of mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to early tracheostomy (within 4 days) or late tracheostomy (after 10 days if still indicated). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality and the analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: Of the 455 patients assigned to early tracheostomy, 91.9% (95% CI, 89.0%-94.1%) received a tracheostomy and of 454 assigned to late tracheostomy, 44.9% (95% CI, 40.4%-49.5%) received a tracheostomy. All-cause mortality 30 days after randomization was 30.8% (95% CI, 26.7%-35.2%) in the early and 31.5% (95% CI, 27.3%-35.9%) in the late group (absolute risk reduction for early vs late, 0.7%; 95% CI, -5.4% to 6.7%). Two-year mortality was 51.0% (95% CI, 46.4%-55.6%) in the early and 53.7% (95% CI, 49.1%-58.3%) in the late group (P = .74). Median critical care unit length of stay in survivors was 13.0 days in the early and 13.1 days in the late group (P = .74). Tracheostomy-related complications were reported for 6.3% (95% CI, 4.6%-8.5%) of patients (5.5% in the early group, 7.8% in the late group). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For patients breathing with the aid of mechanical ventilation treated in adult critical care units in the United Kingdom, tracheostomy within 4 days of critical care admission was not associated with an improvement in 30-day mortality or other important secondary outcomes. The ability of clinicians to predict which patients required extended ventilatory support was limited.

DESIGN: Individual-level fixed-effects estimation based on 2 nonconsecutive 24-hour dietary recalls. SETTING: Nationally representative data from the 2003-2004, 2005-2006, and 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 2 to 11 years (n = 4717) and adolescents aged 12 to 19 years (n = 4699). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily total energy intake in kilocalories; intake of grams of sugar, total fat, saturated fat, and protein and milligrams of sodium; and total grams of sugar-sweetened beverages, regular soda, and milk consumed. RESULTS: Fast-food and full-service restaurant consumption, respectively, was associated with a net increase in daily total energy intake of 126.29 kcal and 160.49 kcal for children and 309.53 kcal and 267.30 kcal for adolescents and with higher intake of regular soda (73.77 g and 88.28 g for children and 163.67 g and 107.25 g for adolescents) and sugar-sweetened beverages generally. Fast-food consumption increased intake of total fat (7.03-14.36 g), saturated fat (1.99-4.64 g), and sugar (5.71-16.24 g) for both age groups and sodium (396.28 mg) and protein (7.94 g) for adolescents. Full-service restaurant consumption was associated with increases in all nutrients examined. Additional key findings were (1) adverse effects on diet were larger for lower-income children and adolescents and (2) among adolescents, increased soda intake was twice as large when fast food was consumed away from home than at home. CONCLUSION: Fast-food and full-service restaurant consumption is associated with higher net total energy intake and poorer diet quality.","Adolescent Beverages/statistics & numerical data Child Child, Preschool Diet/*statistics & numerical data Diet Surveys Dietary Fats Dietary Proteins Dietary Sucrose Energy Intake *Fast Foods Female Humans Male Models, Statistical Multivariate Analysis Poverty Regression Analysis *Restaurants Sodium, Dietary United States Young Adult"

Yet, to our knowledge, they have never been used specifically to lower the GI of the diet. We have therefore undertaken a study of low-GI foods in type 2 DM with a focus on legumes in the intervention. METHODS: A total of 121 participants with type 2 DM were randomized to either a low-GI legume diet that encouraged participants to increase legume intake by at least 1 cup per day, or to increase insoluble fiber by consumption of whole wheat products, for 3 months. The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values with calculated coronary heart disease (CHD) risk score as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: The low-GI legume diet reduced HbA1c values by -0.5% (95% CI, -0.6% to -0.4%) and the high wheat fiber diet reduced HbA1c values by -0.3% (95% CI, -0.4% to -0.2%). The relative reduction in HbA1c values after the low-GI legume diet was greater than after the high wheat fiber diet by -0.2% (95% CI, -0.3% to -0.1%; P < .001). The respective CHD risk reduction on the low-GI legume diet was -0.8% (95% CI, -1.4% to -0.3%; P = .003), largely owing to a greater relative reduction in systolic blood pressure on the low-GI legume diet compared with the high wheat fiber diet (-4.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, -7.0 to -2.1 mm Hg; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Incorporation of legumes as part of a low-GI diet improved both glycemic control and reduced calculated CHD risk score in type 2 DM.","Blood Glucose/*metabolism Cardiovascular Diseases/*etiology Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/complications/*diet therapy Diabetic Diet/*methods Dietary Fiber *Fabaceae Female Glycemic Index Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated/metabolism Humans Male Middle Aged Risk Factors Treatment Outcome"
23779232,Changes in red meat consumption and subsequent risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus: three cohorts of US men and women.,JAMA Intern Med,Pan A and Sun Q and Bernstein AM and Manson JE and Willett WC and Hu FB,nus,"IMPORTANCE: Red meat consumption has been consistently associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, whether changes in red meat intake are related to subsequent T2DM risk remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between changes in red meat consumption during a 4-year period and subsequent 4-year risk of T2DM in US adults. DESIGN AND SETTING: Three prospective cohort studies in US men and women. PARTICIPANTS: We followed up 26,357 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2006), 48,709 women in the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2006), and 74,077 women in the Nurses' Health Study II (1991-2007). Diet was assessed by validated food frequency questionnaires and updated every 4 years. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios with adjustment for age, family history, race, marital status, initial red meat consumption, smoking status, and initial and changes in other lifestyle factors (physical activity, alcohol intake, total energy intake, and diet quality). Results across cohorts were pooled by an inverse variance-weighted, fixed-effect meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident T2DM cases validated by supplementary questionnaires. RESULTS: During 1,965,824 person-years of follow-up, we documented 7540 incident T2DM cases. In the multivariate-adjusted models, increasing red meat intake during a 4-year interval was associated with an elevated risk of T2DM during the subsequent 4 years in each cohort (all P < .001 for trend). Compared with the reference group of no change in red meat intake, increasing red meat intake of more than 0.50 servings per day was associated with a 48% (pooled hazard ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.37-1.59) elevated risk in the subsequent 4-year period, and the association was modestly attenuated after further adjustment for initial body mass index and concurrent weight gain (1.30; 95% CI, 1.21-1.41). Reducing red meat consumption by more than 0.50 servings per day from baseline to the first 4 years of follow-up was associated with a 14% (pooled hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.93) lower risk during the subsequent entire follow-up through 2006 or 2007. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Increasing red meat consumption over time is associated with an elevated subsequent risk of T2DM, and the association is partly mediated by body weight. Our results add further evidence that limiting red meat consumption over time confers benefits for T2DM prevention.","Body Mass Index Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*epidemiology/*etiology Diet/adverse effects Energy Intake Female Follow-Up Studies Health Surveys Humans Male Meat/*adverse effects Middle Aged Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Questionnaires United States/epidemiology Weight Gain"

The benefits of adherence to a regimen of swallowing exercises and maintaining oral intake throughout treatment are reported, but independent effects are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the independent effects of maintaining oral intake throughout radiotherapy and adherence to preventive swallowing exercise. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. PATIENTS: The study included 497 patients treated with definitive RT or CRT for pharyngeal cancer (458 oropharynx, 39 hypopharynx) between 2002 and 2008. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Swallowing-related end points were final diet after RT or CRT and duration of gastrostomy dependence. Primary independent variables included oral intake status at the end of RT or CRT (no oral intake, partial oral intake, or full oral intake) and adherence to a swallowing exercise regimen. Multiple linear regression and ordered logistic regression models were analyzed. RESULTS: At the conclusion of RT or CRT, 131 patients (26%) had no oral intake and 74% maintained oral intake (167 partial [34%], 199 full [40%]). Fifty-eight percent (286 of 497) reported adherence to swallowing exercises. Maintenance of oral intake during RT or CRT and swallowing exercise adherence were independently associated with better long-term diet after RT or CRT (P = .045 and P < .001, respectively) and shorter duration of gastrostomy dependence (P < .001 and P = .007, respectively) in models adjusted for tumor and treatment burden. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The data indicate independent, positive associations of maintenance of oral intake throughout RT or CRT and swallowing exercise adherence with long-term swallowing outcomes. Patients who either eat or exercise fare better than those who do neither. Patients who both eat and exercise have the highest rate of return to a regular diet and shortest duration of gastrostomy dependence.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use Chemoradiotherapy Deglutition/*physiology *Eating Exercise Therapy/*methods Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Middle Aged Pharyngeal Neoplasms/physiopathology/*therapy Retrospective Studies Treatment Outcome"

OBJECTIVE To examine the influence of a nationwide adverse economic environment during infancy, specifically, the high unemployment rates during and after the 1980 and 1981-1982 recessions, on rates of subsequent adolescent substance use and delinquent behaviors. DESIGN We used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 and estimated logit regressions to examine the effect of changes in unemployment rates during infancy on the incidence of adolescent behavioral problems, controlling for known youth, family, and environmental risk factors. SETTING Adolescents living in the United States in 1997. PARTICIPANTS Nationally representative sample of 8984 adolescents born from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 1984. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Probability of engaging in substance use (marijuana, smoking, alcohol, and hard [ie, illegal] drugs) and delinquent behaviors (arrest, handgun use, gang affiliation, petty and major theft, property destruction, and assaultive behavior). RESULTS Exposure to a 1% deviation from mean regional unemployment rates at the age of 1 year was associated with an increase in the odds ratios of engaging in marijuana use (1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.14]), smoking (1.07 [1.03-1.11]), alcohol use (1.06 [1.02-1.10]), arrest (1.17 [1.09-1.25]), gang affiliation (1.09 [1.00-1.19]), and petty (1.06 [1.01-1.10]) and major theft (1.11 [1.05-1.18]). No significant associations were noted with use of hard drugs, property destruction, and assaultive behavior.

OBJECTIVE: To compare patterns of care and quality outcomes for nursing home residents with advanced dementia covered by managed care with those covered by traditional fee-for-service Medicare. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Choices, Attitudes, and Strategies for Care of Advanced Dementia at the End-of-Life (CASCADE) was a prospective cohort study including 22 nursing homes in the Boston, Massachusetts, area that monitored 323 nursing home residents for 18 months to better understand the course of advanced dementia at or near the end of life. Data from CASCADE and Medicare were linked to determine the health insurance status of study participants. EXPOSURES: The health insurance status of the resident, either managed care or traditional fee for service. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcomes included survival, symptoms related to comfort, treatment of pain and dyspnea, presence of pressure ulcers, presence of a do-not-hospitalize order, treatment of pneumonia, hospital transfer (admission or emergency department visit) for an acute illness, hospice referral, primary care visits, and family satisfaction with care. RESULTS: Residents enrolled in managed care (n = 133) were more likely to have do-not-hospitalize orders compared with those in traditional Medicare fee for service (n = 158) (63.7% vs 50.9%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4), were less likely to be transferred to the hospital for acute illness (3.8% vs 15.7%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.5), had more primary care visits per 90 days (mean [SD], 4.8 [2.6] vs 4.2 [5.0]; adjusted rate ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6), and had more nurse practitioner visits (3.0 [2.1] vs 0.8 [2.6]; adjusted rate ratio, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.2-4.1). Survival, comfort, and other treatment outcomes did not differ significantly across groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Medicare managed-care programs may offer a promising approach to ensure that nursing homes are able to provide appropriate, less burdensome, and affordable care, especially at the end of life.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies Dementia/*therapy *Fee-for-Service Plans Female Hospitalization Humans *Insurance Coverage Male *Managed Care Programs *Medicare Middle Aged *Nursing Homes Outcome Assessment (Health Care) United States"
23652524,Elective cesarean delivery on maternal request.,JAMA,Ecker J,partners,"IMPORTANCE: Some pregnant women prefer cesarean delivery and request it without maternal or fetal indication rather than proceeding with a plan for vaginal delivery. OBJECTIVE: To review approaches for counseling women who ask for cesarean delivery without maternal or fetal indication (known as cesarean delivery on maternal request [CDMR]). EVIDENCE REVIEW: An Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality evidence report of studies published after 1990, a 2006 National Institutes of Health state-of-the-science conference report, and published literature were examined. FINDINGS: The prevalence of CDMR in the United States is not precisely known but probably occurs in less than 3% of all deliveries. Most practicing obstetricians have received requests for CDMR from patients. Compared with a plan for vaginal delivery, CDMR may be associated with lower rates of hemorrhage, maternal incontinence, and rare but serious neonatal outcomes. However, CDMR is associated with a higher risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity. Adverse consequences of CDMR may be manifested only in future pregnancies. Repeated cesarean deliveries have higher rates of operative complications, placental abnormalities such as placenta previa and accreta, and consequent gravid hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is no immediate expectation for CDMR to reduce the health risks of mothers or infants. Accordingly, counseling and decisions regarding CDMR should be made after considering a woman's full reproductive plans.","Adult *Cesarean Section/ethics/standards/utilization Counseling Decision Making Female Humans Patient Care Planning *Patient Preference *Postoperative Complications Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications Prevalence Risk *Surgical Procedures, Elective/ethics/standards/utilization United States/epidemiology"
25070067,An electronic screen for triaging adolescent substance use by risk levels.,JAMA Pediatr,Levy S and Weiss R and Sherritt L and Ziemnik R and Spalding A and Van Hook S and Shrier LA,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Screening adolescents for substance use and intervening immediately can reduce the burden of addiction and substance-related morbidity. Several screening tools have been developed to identify problem substance use for adolescents, but none have been calibrated to triage adolescents into clinically relevant risk categories to guide interventions. OBJECTIVE: To describe the psychometric properties of an electronic screen and brief assessment tool that triages adolescents into 4 actionable categories regarding their experience with nontobacco substance use. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Adolescent patients (age range, 12-17 years) arriving for routine medical care at 2 outpatient primary care centers and 1 outpatient center for substance use treatment at a pediatric hospital completed an electronic screening tool from June 1, 2012, through March 31, 2013, that consisted of a question on the frequency of using 8 types of drugs in the past year (Screening to Brief Intervention). Additional questions assessed severity of any past-year substance use. Patients completed a structured diagnostic interview (Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module), yielding Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) substance use diagnoses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For the entire screen and the Screening to Brief Intervention, sensitivity and specificity for identifying nontobacco substance use, substance use disorders, severe substance use disorders, and tobacco dependence were calculated using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module as the criterion standard. RESULTS: Of 340 patients invited to participate, 216 (63.5%) enrolled in the study. Sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 84% (95% CI, 76%-89%) for identifying nontobacco substance use, 90% (95% CI, 77%-96%) and 94% (95% CI, 89%-96%) for substance use disorders, 100% and 94% (95% CI, 90%-96%) for severe substance use disorders, and 75% (95% CI, 52%-89%) and 98% (95% CI, 95%-100%) for nicotine dependence. No significant differences were found in sensitivity or specificity between the full tool and the Screening to Brief Intervention. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A single screening question assessing past-year frequency use for 8 commonly misused categories of substances appears to be a valid method for discriminating among clinically relevant risk categories of adolescent substance use.",Missing

OBJECTIVE To test whether elevated plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with psychological distress and depression. DESIGN We performed cross-sectional and prospective analyses of CRP levels in 4 clinically relevant categories using data from 2 general population studies. SETTING The Copenhagen General Population and the Copenhagen City Heart studies. PARTICIPANTS We examined 73 131 men and women aged 20 to 100 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We ascertained psychological distress with 2 single-item self-reports and depression using self-reported antidepressant use, register-based prescription of antidepressants, and register-based hospitalization with depression. RESULTS In cross-sectional analyses, increasing CRP levels were associated with increasing risk for psychological distress and depression (P = 3 x 10-8 to P = 4 x 10-105 for trend). For self-reported use of antidepressants, the odds ratio was 1.38 (95% CI, 1.23-1.55) for CRP levels of 1.01 to 3.00 mg/L, 2.02 (1.77-2.30) for 3.01 to 10.00 mg/L, and 2.70 (2.25-3.25) for greater than 10.00 mg/L compared with 0.01 to 1.00 mg/L. For prescription of antidepressants, the corresponding odds ratios were 1.08 (95% CI, 0.99-1.17), 1.47 (1.33-1.62), and 1.77 (1.52-2.05), respectively; for hospitalization with depression, 1.30 (1.01-1.67), 1.84 (1.39-2.43), and 2.27 (1.54-3.32), respectively. In prospective analyses, increasing CRP levels were also associated with increasing risk for hospitalization with depression (P = 4 x 10-8 for trend).

23340638,Use of hospital-based acute care among patients recently discharged from the hospital.,JAMA,Vashi AA and Fox JP and Carr BG and D'Onofrio G and Pines JM and Ross JS and Gross CP,yale,"IMPORTANCE: Current efforts to improve health care focus on hospital readmission rates as a marker of quality and on the effectiveness of transitions in care during the period after acute care is received. Emergency department (ED) visits are also a marker of hospital-based acute care following discharge but little is known about ED use during this period. OBJECTIVES: To determine the degree to which ED visits and hospital readmissions contribute to overall use of acute care services within 30 days of discharge from acute care hospitals, to describe the reasons patients return for ED visits, and to describe these patterns among Medicare beneficiaries and those not covered by Medicare insurance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study of patients aged 18 years or older (mean age: 53.4 years) who were discharged between July 1, 2008, and September 31, 2009, from acute care hospitals in 3 large, geographically diverse states (California, Florida, and Nebraska) with data recorded in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project state inpatient and ED databases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 3 primary outcomes during the 30-day period after hospital discharge were ED visits not resulting in admission (treat-and-release encounters), hospital readmissions from any source, and a combined measure of ED visits and hospital readmissions termed hospital-based acute care. RESULTS: The final cohort included 5,032,254 index hospitalizations among 4,028,555 unique patients. In the 30 days following discharge, 17.9% (95% CI, 17.9%-18.0%) of hospitalizations resulted in at least 1 acute care encounter. Of these 1,233,402 postdischarge acute care encounters, ED visits comprised 39.8% (95% CI, 39.7%-39.9%). For every 1000 discharges, there were 97.5 (95% CI, 97.2-97.8) ED treat-and-release visits and 147.6 (95% CI, 147.3-147.9) hospital readmissions in the 30 days following discharge. The number of ED treat-and-release visits ranged from a low of 22.4 (95% CI, 4.6-65.4) encounters per 1000 discharges for breast malignancy to a high of 282.5 (95% CI, 209.7-372.4) encounters per 1000 discharges for uncomplicated benign prostatic hypertrophy. Among the highest volume discharges, the most common reason patients returned to the ED was always related to their index hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: After discharge from acute care hospitals in 3 states, ED visits within 30 days were common among adults and accounted for 39.8% of postdischarge hospital-based acute care visits. Improving care transitions should focus not only on decreasing readmissions but also on ED visits.","Aged Databases, Factual Diagnosis-Related Groups Emergency Service, Hospital/*utilization Humans Medicare/statistics & numerical data Middle Aged Outcome Assessment (Health Care) Patient Discharge/*statistics & numerical data Patient Readmission/*statistics & numerical data Prospective Studies *Quality Indicators, Health Care Time Factors United States"
24867013,Effect of endoscopic sphincterotomy for suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction on pain-related disability following cholecystectomy: the EPISOD randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Cotton PB and Durkalski V and Romagnuolo J and Pauls Q and Fogel E and Tarnasky P and Aliperti G and Freeman M and Kozarek R and Jamidar P and Wilcox M and Serrano J and Brawman-Mintzer O and Elta G and Mauldin P and Thornhill A and Hawes R and Wood-Williams A and Orrell K and Drossman D and Robuck P,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Abdominal pain after cholecystectomy is common and may be attributed to sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Management often involves endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with manometry and sphincterotomy. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether endoscopic sphincterotomy reduces pain and whether sphincter manometric pressure is predictive of pain relief. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Multicenter, sham-controlled, randomized trial involving 214 patients with pain after cholecystectomy without significant abnormalities on imaging or laboratory studies, and no prior sphincter treatment or pancreatitis randomly assigned (August 6, 2008-March 23, 2012) to undergo sphincterotomy or sham therapy at 7 referral medical centers. One-year follow-up was blinded. The final follow-up visit was March 21, 2013. INTERVENTIONS: After ERCP, patients were randomized 2:1 to sphincterotomy (n = 141) or sham (n = 73) irrespective of manometry findings. Those randomized to sphincterotomy with elevated pancreatic sphincter pressures were randomized again (1:1) to biliary or to both biliary and pancreatic sphincterotomies. Seventy-two were entered into an observational study with conventional ERCP managemeny. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Success of treatment was defined as less than 6 days of disability due to pain in the prior 90 days both at months 9 and 12 after randomization, with no narcotic use and no further sphincter intervention. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (37%; 95% CI, 25.9%-48.1%) in the sham treatment group vs 32 (23%; 95% CI, 15.8%-29.6%) in the sphincterotomy group experienced successful treatment (adjusted risk difference, -15.6%; 95% CI, -28.0% to -3.3%; P = .01). Of the patients with pancreatic sphincter hypertension, 14 (30%; 95% CI, 16.7%-42.9%) who underwent dual sphincterotomy and 10 (20%; 95% CI, 8.7%-30.5%) who underwent biliary sphincterotomy alone experienced successful treatment. Thirty-seven treated patients (26%; 95% CI,19%-34%) and 25 patients (34%; 95% CI, 23%-45%) in the sham group underwent repeat ERCP interventions (P = .22). Manometry results were not associated with the outcome. No clinical subgroups appeared to benefit from sphincterotomy more than others. Pancreatitis occurred in 15 patients (11%) after primary sphincterotomies and in 11 patients (15%) in the sham group. Of the nonrandomized patients in the observational study group, 5 (24%; 95% CI, 6%-42%) who underwent biliary sphincterotomy, 12 (31%; 95% CI, 16%-45%) who underwent dual sphincterotomy, and 2 (17%; 95% CI, 0%-38%) who did not undergo sphincterotomy had successful treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with abdominal pain after cholecystectomy undergoing ERCP with manometry, sphincterotomy vs sham did not reduce disability due to pain. These findings do not support ERCP and sphincterotomy for these patients.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if favorable results could be reproduced in a community hospital setting using our ERAS program, which was developed using core ERAS guidelines with the goal of accelerated recovery while also addressing other important outcomes affecting patient experience and safety. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study of ERAS program, a multidisciplinary effort involving anesthesia, preadmission staff, nursing, and surgery staff at a community hospital. The program was initiated in 2010 and was in full practice by 2011. We assessed practice patterns and patient outcomes for all elective colon and rectal resection cases performed in 2009 (prior to ERAS implementation), 2011, and 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Laparoscopic approach, narcotic use, length of stay, 30-day readmission, ileus (defined as reinsertion of nasogastric tube), and intra-abdominal infection and association between colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis and these outcomes. RESULTS: From 2009 to 2012, the use of laparoscopy increased from 57.4% to 88.8% (P < .001). Length of stay decreased significantly (6.7 days vs 3.7 days, P < .001), without an increase in 30-day readmission rate (17.6% vs 12.5%, P = .49). Use of patient-controlled narcotic analgesia and duration of use decreased (63.2% of patients vs 15%, P < .001; 67.8 hours vs 47.1 hours, P = .02). Ileus rate decreased from 13.2% to 2.5% (P = .02). Intra-abdominal infection decreased from 7.4% to 2.5% (P = .24). When comparing laparoscopic cases alone, similar results were observed. Following regression analysis, there were no statistically significant differences between CRC diagnosis and LOS, 30-day readmission rates, ileus, and intra-abdominal infection (all P's > .05). Length of stay reductions resulted in an estimated cost savings of $3202 per patient (2011) and $4803 per patient (2012). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Implementation of this patient care-directed enhanced recovery program is feasible in a community hospital setting, and it is associated with decreased LOS without increased readmission or morbidity, as well as significant decreases in narcotic use and cost. Improved outcomes are independent of the laparoscopic approach and CRC diagnosis.",Missing
25096691,High-protein enteral nutrition enriched with immune-modulating nutrients vs standard high-protein enteral nutrition and nosocomial infections in the ICU: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,van Zanten AR and Sztark F and Kaisers UX and Zielmann S and Felbinger TW and Sablotzki AR and De Waele JJ and Timsit JF and Honing ML and Keh D and Vincent JL and Zazzo JF and Fijn HB and Petit L and Preiser JC and van Horssen PJ and Hofman Z,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Enteral administration of immune-modulating nutrients (eg, glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids, selenium, and antioxidants) has been suggested to reduce infections and improve recovery from critical illness. However, controversy exists on the use of immune-modulating enteral nutrition, reflected by lack of consensus in guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether high-protein enteral nutrition enriched with immune-modulating nutrients (IMHP) reduces the incidence of infections compared with standard high-protein enteral nutrition (HP) in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The MetaPlus study, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial, was conducted from February 2010 through April 2012 including a 6-month follow-up period in 14 intensive care units (ICUs) in the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Belgium. A total of 301 adult patients who were expected to be ventilated for more than 72 hours and to require enteral nutrition for more than 72 hours were randomized to the IMHP (n = 152) or HP (n = 149) group and included in an intention-to-treat analysis, performed for the total population as well as predefined medical, surgical, and trauma subpopulations. INTERVENTIONS: High-protein enteral nutrition enriched with immune-modulating nutrients vs standard high-protein enteral nutrition, initiated within 48 hours of ICU admission and continued during the ICU stay for a maximum of 28 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was incidence of new infections according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions. Secondary end points included mortality, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, mechanical ventilation duration, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and subtypes of infections according CDC definitions. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in incidence of new infections between the groups: 53% (95% CI, 44%-61%) in the IMHP group vs 52% (95% CI, 44%-61%) in the HP group (P = .96). No statistically significant differences were observed in other end points, except for a higher 6-month mortality rate in the medical subgroup: 54% (95% CI, 40%-67%) in the IMHP group vs 35% (95% CI, 22%-49%) in the HP group (P = .04), with a hazard ratio of 1.57 (95% CI, 1.03-2.39; P = .04) for 6-month mortality adjusted for age and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score comparing the groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adult patients breathing with the aid of mechanical ventilation in the ICU, IMHP compared with HP did not improve infectious complications or other clinical end points and may be harmful as suggested by increased adjusted mortality at 6 months. These findings do not support the use of IMHP nutrients in these patients.

Erythropoietin was shown to be neuroprotective in experimental and retrospective clinical studies. OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is an association between early high-dose recombinant human erythropoietin treatment in preterm infants and biomarkers of encephalopathy of prematurity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at term-equivalent age. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 495 infants were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in Switzerland between 2005 and 2012. In a nonrandomized subset of 165 infants (n=77 erythropoietin; n=88 placebo), brain abnormalities were evaluated on MRI acquired at term-equivalent age. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive recombinant human erythropoietin (3000 IU/kg; n=256) or placebo (n=239) intravenously before 3 hours, at 12 to 18 hours, and at 36 to 42 hours after birth. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome of the trial, neurodevelopment at 24 months, has not yet been assessed. The secondary outcome, white matter disease of the preterm infant, was semiquantitatively assessed from MRI at term-equivalent age based on an established scoring method. The resulting white matter injury and gray matter injury scores were categorized as normal or abnormal according to thresholds established in the literature by correlation with neurodevelopmental outcome. RESULTS: At term-equivalent age, compared with untreated controls, fewer infants treated with recombinant human erythropoietin had abnormal scores for white matter injury (22% [17/77] vs 36% [32/88]; adjusted risk ratio [RR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.35-0.96), white matter signal intensity (3% [2/77] vs 11% [10/88]; adjusted RR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.05-0.90), periventricular white matter loss (18% [14/77] vs 33% [29/88]; adjusted RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.92), and gray matter injury (7% [5/77] vs 19% [17/88]; adjusted RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13-0.89). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In an analysis of secondary outcomes of a randomized clinical trial of preterm infants, high-dose erythropoietin treatment within 42 hours after birth was associated with a reduced risk of brain injury on MRI. These findings require assessment in a randomized trial designed primarily to assess this outcome as well as investigation of the association with neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Potential impacts of the new criteria on ASD prevalence are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess potential effects of the DSM-5 ASD criteria on ASD prevalence estimation by retrospectively applying the new criteria to population-based surveillance data collected for previous ASD prevalence estimation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional, population-based ASD surveillance based on clinician review of coded behaviors documented in children's medical and educational evaluations from 14 geographically defined areas in the United States participating in the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network in 2006 and 2008. This study included 8-year-old children living in ADDM Network study areas in 2006 or 2008, including 644 883 children under surveillance, of whom 6577 met surveillance ASD case status based on the DSM-IV-TR. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of children meeting ADDM Network ASD criteria based on the DSM-IV-TR who also met DSM-5 criteria; overall prevalence of ASD using DSM-5 criteria. RESULTS: Among the 6577 children classified by the ADDM Network as having ASD based on the DSM-IV-TR, 5339 (81.2%) met DSM-5 ASD criteria. This percentage was similar for boys and girls but higher for those with than without intellectual disability (86.6% and 72.5%, respectively; P < .001). A total of 304 children met DSM-5 ASD criteria but not current ADDM Network ASD case status. Based on these findings, ASD prevalence per 1000 for 2008 would have been 10.0 (95% CI, 9.6-10.3) using DSM-5 criteria compared with the reported prevalence based on DSM-IV-TR criteria of 11.3 (95% CI, 11.0-11.7). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Autism spectrum disorder prevalence estimates will likely be lower under DSM-5 than under DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria, although this effect could be tempered by future adaptation of diagnostic practices and documentation of behaviors to fit the new criteria.","Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/*diagnosis/epidemiology Comorbidity Cross-Sectional Studies *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Female Humans Intellectual Disability/epidemiology Male Population Surveillance Prevalence Retrospective Studies United States/epidemiology"
23430072,Electromyographic differences between normal upper and lower facial muscles and the influence of onabotulinum toxin a.,JAMA Facial Plast Surg,Winn BJ and Sires BS,columbia,"IMPORTANCE: Empirically determined doses of onabotulinum toxin A for aesthetic treatments are as much as 5 times higher for the upper than for the lower facial muscles. OBJECTIVE: To use electromyography (EMG) to determine objectively whether the disparity between doses is due to intrinsic differences between the muscle groups' responses to onabotulinum toxin A or to variable amounts of paralysis required to achieve the desired aesthetic outcomes. DESIGN: We collected EMG data before and at 2 to 4 weeks and 3 months after 8- and 2-U onabotulinum toxin A injections to the corrugator and depressor anguli oris muscles, respectively. SETTING: A private oculofacial plastic surgery practice. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six subjects recruited from February 1 through April 1, 2009. INTERVENTIONS: Electromyography recordings and cosmetic onabotulinum toxin A injections. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean motor unit (MU) durations and maximal amplitudes at baseline and 2 to 4 weeks and 3 months after injection. RESULTS: Baseline mean MU amplitudes were similar for the corrugator and depressor anguli oris muscles. At 2 to 4 weeks after injection, 78% MU and 64% maximal amplitude reduction for the corrugator muscle were detected, but only 54% MU and 18% maximal amplitude reduction for the depressor anguli oris (P = 2.7 x 10-8 and P = 1.3 x 10-14, respectively). At 3 months, function was partially recovered for both muscle groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Onabotulinum toxin A causes a similar dose-dependent reduction in MU and maximal voluntary amplitudes for muscles of the upper and lower face. The dose disparity appears to result from differences in the amount of paralysis required to achieve desirable aesthetic results.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of lifetime intellectual enrichment with baseline cognitive performance and rate of cognitive decline in an older population without dementia and to estimate the years of protection provided against cognitive impairment by these factors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective analysis of individuals enrolled from October 1, 2004, and in 2008 and 2009 in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a longitudinal, population-based study of cognitive aging in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We studied 1995 individuals without dementia (1718 cognitively normal individuals and 277 individuals with mild cognitive impairment) who completed intellectual lifestyle enrichment measures at baseline and underwent at least 1 follow-up visit. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We studied the effect of lifetime intellectual enrichment by separating the variables into 2 nonoverlapping principal components: education/occupation score and mid/late-life cognitive activity based on self-report questionnaires. A global cognitive z score served as the summary cognition measure. Linear mixed-effects models were used to investigate the associations of demographic and intellectual enrichment measures with global cognitive z score trajectories. RESULTS: Baseline cognitive performance was lower in older individuals; individuals with lower education/occupation score, lower mid/late-life cognitive activity, and APOE genotype; and men (P < .001). The interaction between the 2 intellectual enrichment measures was significant (P < .03) such that the beneficial effect of mid/late-life cognitive activity on baseline cognitive performance was reduced with increasing education/occupation score. Only baseline age, mid/late-life cognitive activity, and APOE4 genotype were significantly associated with longitudinal change in cognitive performance from baseline (P < .05). For APOE4 carriers with high lifetime intellectual enrichment (75th percentile of education/occupation score and midlife to late-life cognitive activity), the onset of cognitive impairment was approximately 8.7 years later compared with low lifetime intellectual enrichment (25th percentile of education/occupation score and mid/late-life cognitive activity). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Higher education/occupation scores were associated with higher levels of cognition. Higher levels of mid/late-life cognitive activity were also associated with higher levels of cognition, but the slope of this association slightly increased over time. Lifetime intellectual enrichment might delay the onset of cognitive impairment and be used as a successful preventive intervention to reduce the impending dementia epidemic.",Missing

23824142,Association between dedicated rural training year and the likelihood of becoming a general surgeon in a small town.,JAMA Surg,Deveney K and Deatherage M and Oehling D and Hunter J,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Although projections of surgical workforce predict an increased need for general surgeons, especially in rural areas, graduates of residency programs increasingly enter urban or metropolitan specialty practice. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether fourth-year residents at a hospital in a rural setting were more likely to enter general surgery practice than a specialty. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In 2002, we initiated a year-long program for fourth-year residents. The records of all surgical residents (n = 70) who completed our general surgical residency and entered practice since the rural rotation began were divided into those completing the rural surgery program (rural) and those who did not (other). Demographic characteristics of the 2 groups and initial intent to practice rural general surgery were compared. Critical end points included completion of a fellowship, general surgery practice, and practice setting population of less than 50,000. As an additional control group, we compared these residents with those who completed residency just before our rural program began (1993-2002) with regard to fellowship and practice characteristics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age, sex, and initial practice plans. RESULTS: Age, sex, and initial practice plans of the 2 groups did not differ. Residents who completed the rural year were more likely to enter general surgery practice (10 of 11 [91%]) than those who did not (28 of 59 [47%]; P = .009). They were also more likely to practice in a site of population less than 50,000 (4 of 11 [36%] vs 4 of 59 [7%]; P = .02). The practice type and fellowship completion rate of the residents who finished all training years at Oregon Health and Science University during 1993-2002 and 2003-2012 did not differ. Most residents who completed the rural year (6 of 11 [55%]) entered residency with a desire to practice general surgery. All of them are practicing general surgery. Of the residents who entered training with a specialty career in mind, 4 of 5 (80%) who completed the rural year are practicing general surgery, while only 13 of 45 (29%) who stayed at our university program for the entire 5 years are in general surgery practice (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Providing residents a dedicated and significant experience in a rural setting increases the likelihood that they will practice general surgery in a similar setting despite initial specialty plans. Implementing such programs might help alleviate the increasing gap in workforce needs of small towns and rural hospitals.","Adult *Career Choice *Education, Medical, Graduate Female General Surgery/*education/*manpower Humans *Internship and Residency Male Oregon Rural Health Services/*manpower"
25117130,Perioperative atrial fibrillation and the long-term risk of ischemic stroke.,JAMA,Gialdini G and Nearing K and Bhave PD and Bonuccelli U and Iadecola C and Healey JS and Kamel H,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Clinically apparent atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke. In contrast, perioperative atrial fibrillation may be viewed as a transient response to physiological stress, and the long-term risk of stroke after perioperative atrial fibrillation is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between perioperative atrial fibrillation and the long-term risk of stroke. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study using administrative claims data on patients hospitalized for surgery (as defined by surgical diagnosis related group codes), and discharged alive and free of documented cerebrovascular disease or preexisting atrial fibrillation from nonfederal California acute care hospitals between 2007 and 2011. Patients undergoing cardiac vs other types of surgery were analyzed separately. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Previously validated diagnosis codes were used to identify ischemic strokes after discharge from the index hospitalization for surgery. The primary predictor variable was atrial fibrillation newly diagnosed during the index hospitalization, as defined by previously validated present-on-admission codes. Patients were censored at postdischarge emergency department encounters or hospitalizations with a recorded diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: Of 1,729,360 eligible patients, 24,711 (1.43%; 95% CI, 1.41%-1.45%) had new-onset perioperative atrial fibrillation during the index hospitalization and 13,952 (0.81%; 95% CI, 0.79%-0.82%) experienced a stroke after discharge. At 1 year after hospitalization for cardiac surgery, cumulative rates of stroke were 0.99% (95% CI, 0.81%-1.20%) in those with perioperative atrial fibrillation and 0.83% (95% CI, 0.76%-0.91%) in those without atrial fibrillation. At 1 year after noncardiac surgery, cumulative rates of stroke were 1.47% (95% CI, 1.24%-1.75%) in those with perioperative atrial fibrillation and 0.36% (95% CI, 0.35%-0.37%) in those without atrial fibrillation. In a Cox proportional hazards analysis accounting for potential confounders, perioperative atrial fibrillation was associated with subsequent stroke both after cardiac surgery (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6) and noncardiac surgery (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.7-2.3). The association was significantly stronger for perioperative atrial fibrillation after noncardiac vs cardiac surgery (P < .001 for interaction). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients hospitalized for surgery, perioperative atrial fibrillation was associated with an increased long-term risk of ischemic stroke, especially following noncardiac surgery.","Adult Aged Atrial Fibrillation/*complications Female Hospitalization Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged Perioperative Period Proportional Hazards Models Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Stroke/*etiology *Surgical Procedures, Operative"
23979322,Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 4 to 8 years of children born at 22 to 25 weeks' gestational age: a meta-analysis.,JAMA Pediatr,Moore GP and Lemyre B and Barrowman N and Daboval T,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Many centers delivering infants at 22 to 25 weeks' gestation have limited data regarding their outcomes. A meta-analysis of the 4- to 8-year neurodevelopmental outcomes and exploration of the limitations of meta-analysis would aid physicians and parents to plan care for these infants. OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate of moderate to severe and severe neurodevelopmental impairment by gestational age in extremely preterm survivors followed up between ages 4 and 8 years, as well as to determine whether there is a significant difference in impairment rates between the successive weeks of gestation of survivors. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A peer-reviewed search strategy obtained English-language publications from MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Personal files and reference lists from identified articles were searched. Contemporary cohorts were obtained by restriction to those published after 2004. Inclusion criteria were prospective cohort studies, follow-up rate of 65% or more, use of standardized testing or classification for impairment, reporting by gestation, and meeting prespecified definitions of impairment. We excluded randomized clinical trials, highly selective cohorts, consensus statements, and reviews. Of 1771 identified records, 89 full-text publications were assessed for eligibility. Using the full text of each publication, 2 authors independently followed a 2-step procedure. First, they determined that 9 studies met inclusion criteria. Next, they extracted data using a structured data collection form. Investigators were contacted for data clarification. RESULTS: All extremely preterm infant survivors have a substantial likelihood of developing moderate to severe impairment. Wide confidence intervals at the lower gestations (eg, at 22 weeks, 43% [95% CI, 21%-69%]; heterogeneity I2, 0%) and high heterogeneity at the higher gestations (eg, at 25 weeks, 24% [95% CI, 17%-32%]; I2, 66%) limit the results. There was a statistically significant absolute decrease in moderate to severe impairment between each week of gestation (6.5% [95% CI, 2%-11%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Knowledge of these data, including the limitations, should facilitate discussion during the shared decision-making process about care plans for these infants, particularly in centers without their own data. More prospective, high-quality, complete cohorts are needed.","Child Child Development Child, Preschool Developmental Disabilities/*epidemiology Female Gestational Age Humans *Infant, Extremely Premature/growth & development *Infant, Low Birth Weight/growth & development Infant, Newborn Male"
24756610,Consequences of false-positive screening mammograms.,JAMA Intern Med,Tosteson AN and Fryback DG and Hammond CS and Hanna LG and Grove MR and Brown M and Wang Q and Lindfors K and Pisano ED,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: False-positive mammograms, a common occurrence in breast cancer screening programs, represent a potential screening harm that is currently being evaluated by the US Preventive Services Task Force. OBJECTIVE: To measure the effect of false-positive mammograms on quality of life by measuring personal anxiety, health utility, and attitudes toward future screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Digital Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (DMIST) quality-of-life substudy telephone survey was performed shortly after screening and 1 year later at 22 DMIST sites and included randomly selected DMIST participants with positive and negative mammograms. EXPOSURE: Mammogram requiring follow-up testing or referral without a cancer diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 6-question short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory state scale (STAI-6) and the EuroQol EQ-5D instrument with US scoring. Attitudes toward future screening as measured by women's self-report of future intention to undergo mammographic screening and willingness to travel and stay overnight to undergo a hypothetical new type of mammography that would identify as many cancers with half the false-positive results. RESULTS: Among 1450 eligible women invited to participate, 1226 (84.6%) were enrolled, with follow-up interviews obtained in 1028 (83.8%). Anxiety was significantly higher for women with false-positive mammograms (STAI-6, 35.2 vs 32.7), but health utility scores did not differ and there were no significant differences between groups at 1 year. Future screening intentions differed by group (25.7% vs 14.2% more likely in false-positive vs negative groups); willingness to travel and stay overnight did not (9.9% vs 10.5% in false-positive vs negative groups). Future screening intention was significantly increased among women with false-positive mammograms (odds ratio, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.54-2.93), younger age (2.78; 1.5-5.0), and poorer health (1.63; 1.09-2.43). Women's anticipated high-level anxiety regarding future false-positive mammograms was associated with willingness to travel overnight (odds ratio, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.28-2.95). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: False-positive mammograms were associated with increased short-term anxiety but not long-term anxiety, and there was no measurable health utility decrement. False-positive mammograms increased women's intention to undergo future breast cancer screening and did not increase their stated willingness to travel to avoid a false-positive result. Our finding of time-limited harm after false-positive screening mammograms is relevant for clinicians who counsel women on mammographic screening and for screening guideline development groups.",Aged Anxiety False Positive Reactions Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Mammography/adverse effects/*psychology Middle Aged Quality of Life
25178884,Cyberbullying Victimization and Mental Health in Adolescents and the Moderating Role of Family Dinners.,JAMA Pediatr,Elgar FJ and Napoletano A and Saul G and Dirks MA and Craig W and Poteat VP and Holt M and Koenig BW,Missing,"Importance: This study presents evidence that cyberbullying victimization relates to internalizing, externalizing, and substance use problems in adolescents and that the frequency of family dinners attenuate these associations. Objectives: To examine the unique association between cyberbullying victimization and adolescent mental health (after controlling differences in involvement in traditional, face-to-face bullying) and to explore the potential moderating role of family contact in this association. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional, observational study used survey data on 18 834 students (aged 12-18 years) from 49 schools in a Midwestern US state. Logistic regression analysis tested associations between cyberbullying victimization and the likelihood of mental health and substance use problems. Negative binomial regression analysis tested direct and synergistic contributions of cyberbullying victimization and family dinners on the rates of mental health and substance use problems. Exposures: Frequency of cyberbullying victimization during the previous 12 months; victimization by traditional (face-to-face) bullying; and perpetration of traditional bullying. Main Outcomes and Measures: Five internalizing mental health problems (anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicide ideation, and suicide attempt), 2 externalizing problems (fighting and vandalism), and 4 substance use problems (frequent alcohol use, frequent binge drinking, prescription drug misuse, and over-the-counter drug misuse). Results: About one-fifth (18.6%) of the sample experienced cyberbullying during the previous 12 months. The frequency of cyberbullying positively related to all 11 internalizing, externalizing, and substance use problems (odds ratios from 2.6 [95% CI, 1.7-3.8] to 4.5 [95% CI, 3.0-6.6]). However, victimization related more closely to rates of problems in adolescents that had fewer family dinners. Conclusions and Relevance: Cyberbullying relates to mental health and substance use problems in adolescents, even after their involvement in face-to-face bullying is taken into account. Although correlational, these results suggest that family dinners (ie, family contact and communication) are beneficial to adolescent mental health and may help protect adolescents from the harmful consequences of cyberbullying.",Missing
23147400,Fasting time and lipid levels in a community-based population: a cross-sectional study.,Arch Intern Med,Sidhu D and Naugler C,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Although current guidelines recommend measuring lipid levels in a fasting state, recent studies suggest that nonfasting lipid profiles change minimally in response to food intake and may be superior to fasting levels in predicting adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between fasting times and lipid levels. METHODS: Cross-sectional examination of laboratory data, including fasting duration (in hours) and lipid results, was performed over a 6-month period in 2011 in a large community-based cohort. Data were obtained from Calgary Laboratory Services, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, the sole supplier of laboratory services for Calgary and surrounding areas (source population, 1.4 million persons). The main outcome measures were mean levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides for fasting intervals from 1 hour to more than 16 hours. After differences in individual ages were controlled for, linear regression models were used to estimate the mean levels of cholesterol subclasses at different fasting times. RESULTS: A total of 209,180 individuals (111,048 females and 98,132 males) were included in the study. The mean levels of total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol differed little among individuals with various fasting times. The mean calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels showed slightly greater variations of up to 10% among groups of patients with different fasting intervals, and the mean triglyceride levels showed variations of up to 20%. CONCLUSION: Fasting times showed little association with lipid subclass levels in a community-based population, which suggests that fasting for routine lipid levels is largely unnecessary.","Adolescent Adult Aged Alberta/epidemiology Child Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Dyslipidemias/blood/*epidemiology *Eating Fasting/*blood Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Lipids/*blood Male Middle Aged Retrospective Studies Young Adult"
23949013,Depression among long-term survivors of head and neck cancer treated with radiation therapy.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Chen AM and Daly ME and Vazquez E and Courquin J and Luu Q and Donald PJ and Farwell DG,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The diagnosis and subsequent treatment of head and neck cancer can have a potentially devastating impact on psychosocial functioning. Although the long-term physical adverse effects of radiation therapy (RT) for head and neck cancer have been well described, relatively few studies have evaluated psychosocial functioning after treatment. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of self-reported depression among survivors of head and neck cancer returning for follow-up after being treated with RT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analysis among 211 comprehensive cancer center patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who had been previously treated with RT and were disease-free with at least 1 year of follow-up. Patients with a history of mood disorder, use of mental health services in the past, or previous or current use of antidepressants or anxiolytics, excluding sleep medications, were specifically excluded. INTERVENTIONS: The University of Washington Quality of Life instrument (UW-QOL), a brief, previously validated, self-administered questionnaire, was used to analyze rates of depression. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The UW-QOL assigned scores of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 subjective responses of mood being ""extremely depressed,"" ""somewhat depressed,"" ""neither in a good mood or depressed,"" ""generally good,"" and ""excellent,"" respectively. RESULTS: The mean mood score did not differ at 1, 3, and 5 years after treatment, with scores of 52.0, 55.7, and 62.1, respectively. The proportion of patients who reported their mood as ""somewhat depressed"" or ""extremely depressed"" was 17%, 15%, and 13% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Variables that were significantly associated with post-RT depression included the presence of tracheostomy tube or laryngeal stoma (P = .01), gastrostomy tube dependence (P = .01), and continued smoking at the time of follow-up (P < .001). Among the patients reporting their mood as either ""somewhat depressed"" or ""extremely depressed"" at 1, 3, and 5 years, the proportion using antidepressants at the time was 6%, 11%, and 0%, respectively. The corresponding proportion of patients actively undergoing or seeking psychotherapy and/or counseling was 3%, 6%, and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite a relatively high rate of depression among patients with head and neck cancer in the post-RT setting, mental health services are severely underutilized.","Age Distribution Aged Analysis of Variance Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/pathology/psychology/radiotherapy Cross-Sectional Studies Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/*epidemiology Female Follow-Up Studies Head and Neck Neoplasms/pathology/*psychology/*radiotherapy Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged *Quality of Life Questionnaires Self Report Severity of Illness Index Sex Distribution Survivors Time Factors"

OBJECTIVE: To describe updated national estimates and characteristics of health care- and community-associated invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in 2011. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Active laboratory-based case finding identified MRSA cultures in 9 US metropolitan areas from 2005 through 2011. Invasive infections (MRSA cultured from normally sterile body sites) were classified as health care-associated community-onset (HACO) infections (cultured </= 3 days after admission and/or prior year dialysis, hospitalization, surgery, long-term care residence, or central vascular catheter presence </= 2 days before culture); hospital-onset infections (cultured >3 days after admission); or community-associated infections if no other criteria were met. National estimates were adjusted using US census and US Renal Data System data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: National estimates of invasive HACO, hospital-onset, and community-associated MRSA infections using US census and US Renal Data System data as the denominator. RESULTS: An estimated 80,461 (95% CI, 69,515-93,914) invasive MRSA infections occurred nationally in 2011. Of these, 48,353 (95% CI, 40,195-58,642) were HACO infections; 14,156 (95% CI, 10,096-20,440) were hospital-onset infections; and 16,560 (95% CI, 12,806-21,811) were community-associated infections. Since 2005, adjusted national estimated incidence rates decreased among HACO infections by 27.7% and hospital-onset infections decreased by 54.2%; community-associated infections decreased by only 5.0%. Among recently hospitalized community-onset (nondialysis) infections, 64% occurred 3 months or less after discharge, and 32% of these were admitted from long-term care facilities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: An estimated 30,800 fewer invasive MRSA infections occurred in the United States in 2011 compared with 2005; in 2011 fewer infections occurred among patients during hospitalization than among persons in the community without recent health care exposures. Effective strategies for preventing infections outside acute care settings will have the greatest impact on further reducing invasive MRSA infections nationally.","Adolescent Adult Aged Child Child, Preschool Community-Acquired Infections/epidemiology/microbiology *Cost of Illness Cross Infection/epidemiology/microbiology Female Hospitalization Humans Infant Long-Term Care Male *Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Middle Aged Nursing Homes Renal Dialysis Risk Factors Staphylococcal Infections/*epidemiology/*microbiology United States/epidemiology"
24519299,Association of varying number of doses of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine with incidence of condyloma.,JAMA,Herweijer E and Leval A and Ploner A and Eloranta S and Simard JF and Dillner J and Netterlid E and Sparen P and Arnheim-Dahlstrom L,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Determining vaccine dose-level protection is essential to minimize program costs and increase mass vaccination program feasibility. Currently, a 3-dose vaccination schedule is recommended for both the quadrivalent and bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. Although the primary goal of HPV vaccination programs is to prevent cervical cancer, condyloma related to HPV types 6 and 11 is also prevented with the quadrivalent vaccine and represents the earliest measurable preventable disease outcome for the HPV vaccine. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between quadrivalent HPV vaccination and first occurrence of condyloma in relation to vaccine dose in a population-based setting. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An open cohort of all females aged 10 to 24 years living in Sweden (n = 1,045,165) was followed up between 2006 and 2010 for HPV vaccination and first occurrence of condyloma using the Swedish nationwide population-based health data registers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) of condyloma were estimated using Poisson regression with vaccine dose as a time-dependent exposure, adjusting for attained age and parental education, and stratified on age at first vaccination. To account for prevalent infections, models included a buffer period of delayed case counting. RESULTS: A total of 20,383 incident cases of condyloma were identified during follow-up, including 322 cases after receipt of at least 1 dose of the vaccine. For individuals aged 10 to 16 years at first vaccination, receipt of 3 doses was associated with an IRR of 0.18 (95% CI, 0.15-0.22) for condyloma, whereas receipt of 2 doses was associated with an IRR of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.21-0.40). One dose was associated with an IRR of 0.31 (95% CI, 0.20-0.49), which corresponds to an IRD of 384 cases (95% CI, 305-464) per 100,000 person-years, compared with no vaccination. The corresponding IRDs for 2 doses were 400 cases (95% CI, 346-454) and for 3 doses, 459 cases (95% CI, 437-482). The number of prevented cases between 3 and 2 doses was 59 (95% CI, 2-117) per 100,000 person-years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although maximum reduction in condyloma risk was seen after receipt of 3 doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine, receipt of 2 vaccine doses was also associated with a considerable reduction in condyloma risk.

OBJECTIVES: To examine coverage and concordance of clinically relevant genetic variation provided by WGS technologies; to quantitate inherited disease risk and pharmacogenomic findings in WGS data and resources required for their discovery and interpretation; and to evaluate clinical action prompted by WGS findings. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An exploratory study of 12 adult participants recruited at Stanford University Medical Center who underwent WGS between November 2011 and March 2012. A multidisciplinary team reviewed all potentially reportable genetic findings. Five physicians proposed initial clinical follow-up based on the genetic findings. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Genome coverage and sequencing platform concordance in different categories of genetic disease risk, person-hours spent curating candidate disease-risk variants, interpretation agreement between trained curators and disease genetics databases, burden of inherited disease risk and pharmacogenomic findings, and burden and interrater agreement of proposed clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Depending on sequencing platform, 10% to 19% of inherited disease genes were not covered to accepted standards for single nucleotide variant discovery. Genotype concordance was high for previously described single nucleotide genetic variants (99%-100%) but low for small insertion/deletion variants (53%-59%). Curation of 90 to 127 genetic variants in each participant required a median of 54 minutes (range, 5-223 minutes) per genetic variant, resulted in moderate classification agreement between professionals (Gross kappa, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.40-0.64), and reclassified 69% of genetic variants cataloged as disease causing in mutation databases to variants of uncertain or lesser significance. Two to 6 personal disease-risk findings were discovered in each participant, including 1 frameshift deletion in the BRCA1 gene implicated in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Physician review of sequencing findings prompted consideration of a median of 1 to 3 initial diagnostic tests and referrals per participant, with fair interrater agreement about the suitability of WGS findings for clinical follow-up (Fleiss kappa, 0.24; P < 001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this exploratory study of 12 volunteer adults, the use of WGS was associated with incomplete coverage of inherited disease genes, low reproducibility of detection of genetic variation with the highest potential clinical effects, and uncertainty about clinically reportable findings. In certain cases, WGS will identify clinically actionable genetic variants warranting early medical intervention. These issues should be considered when determining the role of WGS in clinical medicine.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Female Genes, BRCA1 Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Genome, Human/*genetics Genotype Humans Male Middle Aged *Mutation *Pharmacogenetics Reproducibility of Results Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods"

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the association of decline in estimated GFR with subsequent progression to ESRD with implications for using lesser declines in estimated GFR as potential alternative end points for CKD progression. Because most people with CKD die before reaching ESRD, mortality risk also was investigated. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Individual meta-analysis of 1.7 million participants with 12,344 ESRD events and 223,944 deaths from 35 cohorts in the CKD Prognosis Consortium with a repeated measure of serum creatinine concentration over 1 to 3 years and outcome data. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Transfer of individual participant data or standardized analysis of outputs for random-effects meta-analysis conducted between July 2012 and September 2013, with baseline estimated GFR values collected from 1975 through 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: End-stage renal disease (initiation of dialysis or transplantation) or all-cause mortality risk related to percentage change in estimated GFR over 2 years, adjusted for potential confounders and first estimated GFR. RESULTS: The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of ESRD and mortality were higher with larger estimated GFR decline. Among participants with baseline estimated GFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the adjusted HRs for ESRD were 32.1 (95% CI, 22.3-46.3) for changes of -57% in estimated GFR and 5.4 (95% CI, 4.5-6.4) for changes of -30%. However, changes of -30% or greater (6.9% [95% CI, 6.4%-7.4%] of the entire consortium) were more common than changes of -57% (0.79% [95% CI, 0.52%-1.06%]). This association was strong and consistent across the length of the baseline period (1 to 3 years), baseline estimated GFR, age, diabetes status, or albuminuria. Average adjusted 10-year risk of ESRD (in patients with a baseline estimated GFR of 35 mL/min/1.73 m2) was 99% (95% CI, 95%-100%) for estimated GFR change of -57%, was 83% (95% CI, 71%-93%) for estimated GFR change of -40%, and was 64% (95% CI, 52%-77%) for estimated GFR change of -30% vs 18% (95% CI, 15%-22%) for estimated GFR change of 0%. Corresponding mortality risks were 77% (95% CI, 71%-82%), 60% (95% CI, 56%-63%), and 50% (95% CI, 47%-52%) vs 32% (95% CI, 31%-33%), showing a similar but weaker pattern. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Declines in estimated GFR smaller than a doubling of serum creatinine concentration occurred more commonly and were strongly and consistently associated with the risk of ESRD and mortality, supporting consideration of lesser declines in estimated GFR (such as a 30% reduction over 2 years) as an alternative end point for CKD progression.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies Creatinine/blood Disease Progression Endpoint Determination Female *Glomerular Filtration Rate Humans Kidney Failure, Chronic/*mortality/*physiopathology Male Middle Aged Reference Values Risk"
25138332,Effect of oximetry on hospitalization in bronchiolitis: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Schuh S and Freedman S and Coates A and Allen U and Parkin PC and Stephens D and Ungar W and DaSilva Z and Willan AR,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Routine use of pulse oximetry has been associated with changes in bronchiolitis management and may have lowered the hospitalization threshold for patients with bronchiolitis. OBJECTIVE: To examine if infants with bronchiolitis whose displayed oximetry measurements have been artificially elevated 3 percentage points above true values experience hospitalization rates at least 15% lower compared with infants with true values displayed. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial conducted from 2008 to 2013 in a tertiary-care pediatric emergency department in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Participants were 213 otherwise healthy infants aged 4 weeks to 12 months with mild to moderate bronchiolitis and true oxygen saturations of 88% or higher. INTERVENTIONS: Pulse oximetry measurements with true saturation values displayed or with altered saturation values displayed that have been increased 3 percentage points above true values. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was hospitalization within 72 hours, defined as inpatient admission within this interval or active hospital care for greater than 6 hours. Secondary outcomes included the use of supplemental oxygen in the emergency department, level of physician agreement with discharge from the emergency department, length of emergency department stay, and unscheduled visits for bronchiolitis within 72 hours. RESULTS: Forty-four of 108 patients (41%) in the true oximetry group and 26 of 105 (25%) in the altered oximetry group were hospitalized within 72 hours (difference, 16% [95% CI for the difference, 3.6% to 28.4%]; P = .005). Using the emergency department physician as a random effect, the primary treatment effect remained significant (adjusted odds ratio, 4.0 [95% CI, 1.6 to 10.5]; P = .009). None of the secondary outcomes were significantly different between the groups. There were 23 of 108 (21.3%) subsequent unscheduled medical visits for bronchiolitis in the true oximetry group and 15 of 105 (14.3%) in the altered oximetry group (difference, 7% [95% CI, -0.3% to 0.2%]; P = .18). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among infants presenting to an emergency department with mild to moderate bronchiolitis, those with an artificially elevated pulse oximetry reading were less likely to be hospitalized within 72 hours or to receive active hospital care for more than 6 hours than those with unaltered oximetry readings. This suggests that oxygen saturation should not be the only factor in the decision to admit, and its use may need to be reevaluated.

24794370,The familial risk of autism.,JAMA,Sandin S and Lichtenstein P and Kuja-Halkola R and Larsson H and Hultman CM and Reichenberg A,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aggregates in families, but the individual risk and to what extent this is caused by genetic factors or shared or nonshared environmental factors remains unresolved. OBJECTIVE: To provide estimates of familial aggregation and heritability of ASD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A population-based cohort including 2,049,973 Swedish children born 1982 through 2006. We identified 37,570 twin pairs, 2,642,064 full sibling pairs, 432,281 maternal and 445,531 paternal half sibling pairs, and 5,799,875 cousin pairs. Diagnoses of ASD to December 31, 2009 were ascertained. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The relative recurrence risk (RRR) measures familial aggregation of disease. The RRR is the relative risk of autism in a participant with a sibling or cousin who has the diagnosis (exposed) compared with the risk in a participant with no diagnosed family member (unexposed). We calculated RRR for both ASD and autistic disorder adjusting for age, birth year, sex, parental psychiatric history, and parental age. We estimated how much of the probability of developing ASD can be related to genetic (additive and dominant) and environmental (shared and nonshared) factors. RESULTS: In the sample, 14,516 children were diagnosed with ASD, of whom 5689 had autistic disorder. The RRR and rate per 100,000 person-years for ASD among monozygotic twins was estimated to be 153.0 (95% CI, 56.7-412.8; rate, 6274 for exposed vs 27 for unexposed ); for dizygotic twins, 8.2 (95% CI, 3.7-18.1; rate, 805 for exposed vs 55 for unexposed); for full siblings, 10.3 (95% CI, 9.4-11.3; rate, 829 for exposed vs 49 for unexposed); for maternal half siblings, 3.3 (95% CI, 2.6-4.2; rate, 492 for exposed vs 94 for unexposed); for paternal half siblings, 2.9 (95% CI, 2.2-3.7; rate, 371 for exposed vs 85 for unexposed); and for cousins, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.8-2.2; rate, 155 for exposed vs 49 for unexposed). The RRR pattern was similar for autistic disorder but of slightly higher magnitude.We found support for a disease etiology including only additive genetic and nonshared environmental effects. The ASD heritability was estimated to be 0.50 (95% CI, 0.45-0.56) and the autistic disorder heritability was estimated to 0.54 (95% CI, 0.44-0.64). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among children born in Sweden, the individual risk of ASD and autistic disorder increased with increasing genetic relatedness. Heritability of ASD and autistic disorder were estimated to be approximately 50%. These findings may inform the counseling of families with affected children.","Adolescent Adult Autistic Disorder/*genetics Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Female *Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Male Maternal Age Paternal Age Registries Risk Sweden Twins, Monozygotic/genetics Young Adult"
23443444,Surveillance intervals for small abdominal aortic aneurysms: a meta-analysis.,JAMA,Bown MJ and Sweeting MJ and Brown LC and Powell JT and Thompson SG,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs [3.0 cm-5.4 cm in diameter]) are monitored by ultrasound surveillance. The intervals between surveillance scans should be chosen to detect an expanding aneurysm prior to rupture. OBJECTIVE: To limit risk of aneurysm rupture or excessive growth by optimizing ultrasound surveillance intervals. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Individual patient data from studies of small AAA growth and rupture were assessed. Studies were identified for inclusion through a systematic literature search through December 2010. Study authors were contacted, which yielded 18 data sets providing repeated ultrasound measurements of AAA diameter over time in 15,471 patients. DATA EXTRACTION: AAA diameters were analyzed using a random-effects model that allowed for between-patient variability in size and growth rate. Rupture rates were analyzed by proportional hazards regression using the modeled AAA diameter as a time-varying covariate. Predictions of the risks of exceeding 5.5-cm diameter and of rupture within given time intervals were estimated and pooled across studies by random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: AAA growth and rupture rates varied considerably across studies. For each 0.5-cm increase in AAA diameter, growth rates increased on average by 0.59 mm per year (95% CI, 0.51-0.66) and rupture rates increased by a factor of 1.91 (95% CI, 1.61-2.25). For example, to control the AAA growth risk in men of exceeding 5.5 cm to below 10%, on average, a 7.4-year surveillance interval (95% CI, 6.7-8.1) is sufficient for a 3.0-cm AAA, while an 8-month interval (95% CI, 7-10) is necessary for a 5.0-cm AAA. To control the risk of rupture in men to below 1%, the corresponding estimated surveillance intervals are 8.5 years (95% CI, 7.0-10.5) and 17 months (95% CI, 14-22). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In contrast to the commonly adopted surveillance intervals in current AAA screening programs, surveillance intervals of several years may be clinically acceptable for the majority of patients with small AAA.","Aneurysm, Ruptured/prevention & control/*ultrasonography Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/*pathology/*ultrasonography Disease Progression Female Humans Male Risk Time Factors Ultrasonography/standards Watchful Waiting/*standards"

OBJECTIVE To improve the management of suspected AMI in women by exploring sex-specific CPCs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From April 21, 2006, through August 12, 2012, we enrolled 2475 consecutive patients (796 women and 1679 men) presenting with acute chest pain to 9 emergency departments in a prospective multicenter study. The final diagnosis of AMI was adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment of AMI in the emergency department. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sex-specific diagnostic performance of 34 predefined and uniformly recorded CPCs in the early diagnosis of AMI. RESULTS: Acute myocardial infarction was the adjudicated final diagnosis in 143 women (18.0%) and 369 men (22.0%). Although most CPCs were reported with similar frequency in women and men, several CPCs were reported more frequently in women (P < .05). The accuracy of most CPCs in the diagnosis of AMI was low in women and men, with likelihood ratios close to 1. Thirty-one of 34 CPCs (91.2%) showed similar likelihood ratios for the diagnosis of AMI in women and men, and only 3 CPCs (8.8%) seemed to have a sex-specific diagnostic performance with P < .05 for interaction. These CPCs were related to pain duration (2-30 and >30 minutes) and dynamics (decreasing pain intensity). However, because their likelihood ratios were close to 1, the 3 CPCs did not seem clinically helpful. Similar results were obtained when examining combinations of CPCs (all interactions, P >/= .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Differences in the sex-specific diagnostic performance of CPCs are small and do not seem to support the use of women-specific CPCs in the early diagnosis of AMI.

25117129,Effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Holme O and Loberg M and Kalager M and Bretthauer M and Hernan MA and Aas E and Eide TJ and Skovlund E and Schneede J and Tveit KM and Hoff G,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Colorectal cancer is a major health burden. Screening is recommended in many countries. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in a population-based trial. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial of 100,210 individuals aged 50 to 64 years, identified from the population of Oslo city and Telemark County, Norway. Screening was performed in 1999-2000 (55-64-year age group) and in 2001 (50-54-year age group), with follow-up ending December 31, 2011. Of those selected, 1415 were excluded due to prior colorectal cancer, emigration, or death, and 3 could not be traced in the population registry. INTERVENTIONS: Participants randomized to the screening group were invited to undergo screening. Within the screening group, participants were randomized 1:1 to receive once-only flexible sigmoidoscopy or combination of once-only flexible sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood testing (FOBT). Participants with positive screening test results (cancer, adenoma, polyp >/=10 mm, or positive FOBT) were offered colonoscopy. The control group received no intervention. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 98,792 participants were included in the intention-to-screen analyses, of whom 78,220 comprised the control group and 20,572 comprised the screening group (10,283 randomized to receive a flexible sigmoidoscopy and 10,289 to receive flexible sigmoidoscopy and FOBT). Adherence with screening was 63%. After a median of 10.9 years, 71 participants died of colorectal cancer in the screening group vs 330 in the control group (31.4 vs 43.1 deaths per 100,000 person-years; absolute rate difference, 11.7 [95% CI, 3.0-20.4]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56-0.94]). Colorectal cancer was diagnosed in 253 participants in the screening group vs 1086 in the control group (112.6 vs 141.0 cases per 100,000 person-years; absolute rate difference, 28.4 [95% CI, 12.1-44.7]; HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.70-0.92]). Colorectal cancer incidence was reduced in both the 50- to 54-year age group (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.94) and the 55- to 64-year age group (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.96). There was no difference between the flexible sigmoidoscopy only vs the flexible sigmoidoscopy and FOBT screening groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In Norway, once-only flexible sigmoidoscopy screening or flexible sigmoidoscopy and FOBT reduced colorectal cancer incidence and mortality on a population level compared with no screening. Screening was effective both in the 50- to 54-year and the 55- to 64-year age groups.

23493992,Combined rhinoplasty and genioplasty: long-term follow-up.,JAMA Facial Plast Surg,Bertossi D and Albanese M and Turra M and Favero V and Nocini P and Lucchese A,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Long-term follow-up reference for experienced clinicians dedicated to profileplasty. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term results and complications of combined rhinoplasty and genioplasty. DESIGN: Retrospective study including objective and subjective evaluation before and after 3 years of undergoing simultaneous open rhinoplasty and genioplasty among a cohort of 90 patients. SETTING Academic medical center. PATIENTS: A total of 90 cases of combined rhinoplasty and genioplasty performed from January 2002 through January 2004 were reviewed to evaluate the stability of the esthetic result. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Long-term stability of the esthetic outcome of the simultaneous open rhinoplasty and genioplasty. RESULTS: Soft-tissue Pogonion projection to the true vertical line and mandibular height (mandibular incisor tip to menton) were recorded. As far as reduction genioplasty patients are concerned, 45.6% of the patient population had a 100% stability after 3 years (<0.25 mm resorption measured at the menton). On the other hand, if augmentation genioplasty patients are considered, 52.4% (22 patients with a vertical augmentation range from 4-6 mm; mean, 5.3 mm; and 25 patients with a sagittal augmentation from 6-8 mm; mean, 7.2 mm) had 100% stability after 3 years. The chin was stable with no more than 1 mm of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of the study indicate that the combined approach in correcting the facial profile is an effective procedure to achieve a more harmonic and consistent clinical outcome. The recurrence rate of less than 1 mm on the chin bone measurements is relevant to support this statement. An aesthetically proportionate face is strongly determined by the nasal-cervical relationship when observing the patient's profile. Even after a successful rhinoplasty, the patient's face can lack aesthetic attractiveness. Combined rhinoplasty-genioplasty is usually the best solution, particularly for patients with microgenia. It provides optimum patient satisfaction with a low incidence of recurrence.

24430319,Effect of 3 to 5 years of scheduled CEA and CT follow-up to detect recurrence of colorectal cancer: the FACS randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Primrose JN and Perera R and Gray A and Rose P and Fuller A and Corkhill A and George S and Mant D,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Intensive follow-up after surgery for colorectal cancer is common practice but is based on limited evidence. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of scheduled blood measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and computed tomography (CT) as follow-up to detect recurrent colorectal cancer treatable with curative intent. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial in 39 National Health Service hospitals in the United Kingdom; 1202 eligible participants were recruited between January 2003 and August 2009 who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, including adjuvant treatment if indicated, with no evidence of residual disease on investigation. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: CEA only (n = 300), CT only (n = 299), CEA+CT (n = 302), or minimum follow-up (n = 301). Blood CEA was measured every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years; CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years; and the minimum follow-up group received follow-up if symptoms occurred. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent; secondary outcomes were mortality (total and colorectal cancer), time to detection of recurrence, and survival after treatment of recurrence with curative intent. RESULTS: After a mean 4.4 (SD, 0.8) years of observation, cancer recurrence was detected in 199 participants (16.6%; 95% CI, 14.5%-18.7%) overall; 71 of 1202 participants (5.9%; 95% CI, 4.6%-7.2%) were treated for recurrence with curative intent, with little difference according to Dukes staging (stage A, 5.1% [13/254]; stage B, 6.1% [34/553]; stage C, 6.2% [22/354]). Surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent was 2.3% (7/301) in the minimum follow-up group, 6.7% (20/300) in the CEA group, 8% (24/299) in the CT group, and 6.6% (20/302) in the CEA+CT group. Compared with minimum follow-up, the absolute difference in the percentage of patients treated with curative intent in the CEA group was 4.4% (95% CI, 1.0%-7.9%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.00; 95% CI, 1.23-7.33), in the CT group was 5.7% (95% CI, 2.2%-9.5%; adjusted OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.51-8.69), and in the CEA+CT group was 4.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-7.9%; adjusted OR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.10-8.71). The number of deaths was not significantly different in the combined intensive monitoring groups (CEA, CT, and CEA+CT; 18.2% [164/901]) vs the minimum follow-up group (15.9% [48/301]; difference, 2.3%; 95% CI, -2.6% to 7.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, intensive imaging or CEA screening each provided an increased rate of surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent compared with minimal follow-up; there was no advantage in combining CEA and CT. If there is a survival advantage to any strategy, it is likely to be small.

24000094,Relationship of Mediterranean diet and caloric intake to phenoconversion in Huntington disease.,JAMA Neurol,Marder K and Gu Y and Eberly S and Tanner CM and Scarmeas N and Oakes D and Shoulson I,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Adherence to Mediterranean-type diet (MeDi) may delay onset of Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Whether adherence to MeDi affects time to phenoconversion in Huntington disease (HD), a highly penetrant, single-gene disorder, is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine if MeDi modifies the time to clinical onset of HD (phenoconversion) in premanifest carriers participating in Prospective Huntington at Risk Observational Study (PHAROS), and to examine the effects of body mass index and caloric intake on time to phenoconversion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort study of 41 Huntington study group sites in the United States and Canada involving 1001 participants enrolled in PHAROS between July 1999 and January 2004 who were followed up every 9 months until 2010. A total of 211 participants aged 26 to 57 years had an expanded CAG repeat length (>/= 37). EXPOSURE: A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was administered 33 months after baseline. We calculated daily gram intake for dairy, meat, fruit, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish, monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids, and alcohol and constructed MeDi scores (0-9); higher scores indicate higher adherence. Demographics, medical history, body mass index, and Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) score were collected. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Cox proportional hazards regression models to determine the association of MeDi and phenoconversion. RESULTS Age, sex, caloric intake, education status, and UHDRS motor scores did not differ among MeDi tertiles (0-3, 4-5, and 6-9). The highest body mass index was associated with the lowest adherence to MeDi. Thirty-one participants phenoconverted. In a model adjusted for age, CAG repeat length, and caloric intake, MeDi was not associated with phenoconversion (P for trend = 0.14 for tertile of MeDi, and P = .22 for continuous MeDi). When individual components of MeDi were analyzed, higher dairy consumption (hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.0-5.57; P = .05) and higher caloric intake (P = .04) were associated with risk of phenoconversion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: MeDi was not associated with phenoconversion; however, higher consumption of dairy products had a 2-fold increased risk and may be a surrogate for lower urate levels (associated with faster progression in manifest HD). Studies of diet and energy expenditure in premanifest HD may provide data for interventions to modify specific components of diet that may delay the onset of HD.","Adult Body Mass Index Canada Diet, Mediterranean Disease Progression Energy Intake/*physiology Female Humans Huntington Disease/*complications/genetics/*prevention & control Male *Medication Adherence Middle Aged Observation Phenotype Predictive Value of Tests Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Questionnaires Retrospective Studies Severity of Illness Index Time Factors Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion/genetics United States"
24893087,Association of azithromycin with mortality and cardiovascular events among older patients hospitalized with pneumonia.,JAMA,Mortensen EM and Halm EA and Pugh MJ and Copeland LA and Metersky M and Fine MJ and Johnson CS and Alvarez CA and Frei CR and Good C and Restrepo MI and Downs JR and Anzueto A,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Although clinical practice guidelines recommend combination therapy with macrolides, including azithromycin, as first-line therapy for patients hospitalized with pneumonia, recent research suggests that azithromycin may be associated with increased cardiovascular events. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of azithromycin use with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events for patients hospitalized with pneumonia. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study comparing older patients hospitalized with pneumonia from fiscal years 2002 through 2012 prescribed azithromycin therapy and patients receiving other guideline-concordant antibiotic therapy. SETTING: This study was conducted using national Department of Veterans Affairs administrative data of patients hospitalized at any Veterans Administration acute care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients were included if they were aged 65 years or older, were hospitalized with pneumonia, and received antibiotic therapy concordant with national clinical practice guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included 30- and 90-day all-cause mortality and 90-day cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and any cardiac event. Propensity score matching was used to control for the possible effects of known confounders with conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 73,690 patients from 118 hospitals identified, propensity-matched groups were composed of 31,863 patients exposed to azithromycin and 31,863 matched patients who were not exposed. There were no significant differences in potential confounders between groups after matching. Ninety-day mortality was significantly lower in those who received azithromycin (exposed, 17.4%, vs unexposed, 22.3%; odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.70-0.76). However, we found significantly increased odds of myocardial infarction (5.1% vs 4.4%; OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08-1.25) but not any cardiac event (43.0% vs 42.7%; OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.98-1.05), cardiac arrhythmias (25.8% vs 26.0%; OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.02), or heart failure (26.3% vs 26.2%; OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.97-1.04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among older patients hospitalized with pneumonia, treatment that included azithromycin compared with other antibiotics was associated with a lower risk of 90-day mortality and a smaller increased risk of myocardial infarction. These findings are consistent with a net benefit associated with azithromycin use.","Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Anti-Bacterial Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Azithromycin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Cardiovascular Diseases/*chemically induced Cohort Studies Female Hospitals, Veterans/statistics & numerical data Humans Inpatients Male Pneumonia/*drug therapy/mortality Retrospective Studies Risk United States/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVE: To compare time to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, or death in a cohort of metformin initiators who added insulin or a sulfonylurea. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort constructed with national Veterans Health Administration, Medicare, and National Death Index databases. The study population comprised veterans initially treated with metformin from 2001 through 2008 who subsequently added either insulin or sulfonylurea. Propensity score matching on characteristics was performed, matching each participant who added insulin to 5 who added a sulfonylurea. Patients were followed through September 2011 for primary analyses or September 2009 for cause-of-death analyses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk of a composite outcome of AMI, stroke hospitalization, or all-cause death was compared between therapies with marginal structural Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for baseline and time-varying demographics, medications, cholesterol level, hemoglobin A1c level, creatinine level, blood pressure, body mass index, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Among 178,341 metformin monotherapy patients, 2948 added insulin and 39,990 added a sulfonylurea. Propensity score matching yielded 2436 metformin + insulin and 12,180 metformin + sulfonylurea patients. At intensification, patients had received metformin for a median of 14 months (IQR, 5-30), and hemoglobin A1c level was 8.1% (IQR, 7.2%-9.9%). Median follow-up after intensification was 14 months (IQR, 6-29 months). There were 172 vs 634 events for the primary outcome among patients who added insulin vs sulfonylureas, respectively (42.7 vs 32.8 events per 1000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.30; 95% CI, 1.07-1.58; P = .009). Acute myocardial infarction and stroke rates were statistically similar, 41 vs 229 events (10.2 and 11.9 events per 1000 person-years; aHR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.59-1.30; P = .52), whereas all-cause death rates were 137 vs 444 events, respectively (33.7 and 22.7 events per 1000 person-years; aHR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.15-1.79; P = .001).

24838476,Vitamin C supplementation for pregnant smoking women and pulmonary function in their newborn infants: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,McEvoy CT and Schilling D and Clay N and Jackson K and Go MD and Spitale P and Bunten C and Leiva M and Gonzales D and Hollister-Smith J and Durand M and Frei B and Buist AS and Peters D and Morris CD and Spindel ER,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Maternal smoking during pregnancy adversely affects offspring lung development, with lifelong decreases in pulmonary function and increased asthma risk. In a primate model, vitamin C blocked some of the in-utero effects of nicotine on lung development and offspring pulmonary function. OBJECTIVE: To determine if newborns of pregnant smokers randomized to receive daily vitamin C would have improved results of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and decreased wheezing compared with those randomized to placebo. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind trial conducted in 3 sites in the Pacific Northwest between March 2007 and January 2011. One hundred fifty-nine newborns of randomized pregnant smokers (76 vitamin C treated and 83 placebo treated) and 76 newborns of pregnant nonsmokers were studied with newborn PFTs. Follow-up assessment including wheezing was assessed through age 1 year, and PFTs were performed at age 1 year. INTERVENTIONS: Pregnant women were randomized to receive vitamin C (500 mg/d) (n = 89) or placebo (n = 90). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was measurement of newborn pulmonary function (ratio of the time to peak tidal expiratory flow to expiratory time [TPTEF:TE] and passive respiratory compliance per kilogram [Crs/kg]) within 72 hours of age. Secondary outcomes included incidence of wheezing through age 1 year and PFT results at age 1 year. A subgroup of pregnant smokers and nonsmokers had genotyping performed. RESULTS: Newborns of women randomized to vitamin C (n = 76), compared with those randomized to placebo (n = 83), had improved pulmonary function as measured by TPTEF:TE (0.383 vs 0.345 [adjusted 95% CI for difference, 0.011-0.062]; P = .006) and Crs/kg (1.32 vs 1.20 mL/cm H2O/kg [95% CI, 0.02-0.20]; P = .01). Offspring of women randomized to vitamin C had significantly decreased wheezing through age 1 year (15/70 [21%] vs 31/77 [40%]; relative risk, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.33-0.95]; P = .03). There were no significant differences in the 1-year PFT results between the vitamin C and placebo groups. The effect of maternal smoking on newborn lung function was associated with maternal genotype for the alpha5 nicotinic receptor (rs16969968) (P < .001 for interaction). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Supplemental vitamin C taken by pregnant smokers improved newborn PFT results and decreased wheezing through 1 year in the offspring. Vitamin C in pregnant smokers may be an inexpensive and simple approach to decrease the effects of smoking in pregnancy on newborn pulmonary function and respiratory morbidities.

The usefulness of the FI as an outcome measure in geriatric trauma patients is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the FI as an effective assessment tool in predicting adverse outcomes in geriatric trauma patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 2-year (June 2011 to February 2013) prospective cohort study at a level I trauma center at the University of Arizona. We prospectively measured frailty in all geriatric trauma patients. Geriatric patients were defined as those 65 years or older. The FI was calculated using 50 preadmission frailty variables. Frailty in patients was defined by an FI of 0.25 or higher. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was in-hospital complications. The secondary outcome measure was adverse discharge disposition. In-hospital complications were defined as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, hematologic, renal, and reoperation. Adverse discharge disposition was defined as discharge to a skilled nursing facility or in-hospital mortality. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between the FI and outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 250 patients were enrolled, with a mean (SD) age of 77.9 (8.1) years, median Injury Severity Score of 15 (range, 9-18), median Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 (range, 12-15), and mean (SD) FI of 0.21 (0.10). Forty-four percent (n = 110) of patients had frailty. Patients with frailty were more likely to have in-hospital complications (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-6.0; P = .001) and adverse discharge disposition (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4; P = .001). The mortality rate was 2.0% (n = 5), and all patients who died had frailty. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The FI is an independent predictor of in-hospital complications and adverse discharge disposition in geriatric trauma patients. This index should be used as a clinical tool for risk stratification in this patient group.",Missing
24740450,Characterizing the relationship between free drug samples and prescription patterns for acne vulgaris and rosacea.,JAMA Dermatol,Hurley MP and Stafford RS and Lane AT,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Describing the relationship between the availability of free prescription drug samples and dermatologists' prescribing patterns on a national scale can help inform policy guidelines on the use of free samples in a physician's office. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationships between free drug samples and dermatologists' local and national prescribing patterns and between the availability of free drug samples and prescription costs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study investigating prescribing practices for acne, a common dermatologic condition for which free samples are often available. The settings were, first, the offices of nationally representative dermatologists from the National Disease and Therapeutic Index (an IMS Health Incorporated database) and, second, an academic medical center clinic without samples. Participants were ambulatory patients who received a prescription from a dermatologist for a primary initial diagnosis of acne vulgaris or rosacea in 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: National trends in dermatologist prescribing patterns, the degree of correlation between the availability of free samples and the prescribing of brand-name medications, and the mean cost of acne medications prescribed per office visit nationally and at an academic medical center without samples. RESULTS: On a national level, the provision of samples with a prescription by dermatologists has been increasing over time, and this increase is correlated (r = 0.92) with the use of the branded generic drugs promoted by these samples. Branded and branded generic drugs comprised most of the prescriptions written nationally (79%), while they represented only 17% at an academic medical center clinic without samples. Because of the increased use of branded and branded generic drugs, the national mean total retail cost of prescriptions at an office visit for acne was conservatively estimated to be 2 times higher (approximately $465 nationally vs $200 at an academic medical center without samples). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Free drug samples can alter the prescribing habits of physicians away from the use of less expensive generic medications. The benefits of free samples in dermatology must be weighed against potential negative effects on prescribing behavior and prescription costs.","Acne Vulgaris/diagnosis/*drug therapy Cost Savings Cross-Sectional Studies Databases, Factual Dermatologic Agents/economics/therapeutic use Dermatology/methods Drug Industry/economics/*trends Drug Utilization/economics/*trends Female Humans Male Marketing/economics/trends Physician's Practice Patterns/economics/*trends Prescription Drugs/*administration & dosage Rosacea/diagnosis/*drug therapy United States"
24018712,The frequency and cost of treatment perceived to be futile in critical care.,JAMA Intern Med,Huynh TN and Kleerup EC and Wiley JF and Savitsky TD and Guse D and Garber BJ and Wenger NS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Physicians often perceive as futile intensive care interventions that prolong life without achieving an effect that the patient can appreciate as a benefit. The prevalence and cost of critical care perceived to be futile have not been prospectively quantified. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the prevalence and cost of treatment perceived to be futile in adult critical care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: To develop a common definition of futile care, we convened a focus group of clinicians who care for critically ill patients. On a daily basis for 3 months, we surveyed critical care specialists in 5 intensive care units (ICUs) at an academic health care system to identify patients whom the physicians believed were receiving futile treatment. Using a multivariate model, we identified patient and clinician characteristics associated with patients perceived to be receiving futile treatment. We estimated the total cost of futile treatment by summing the charges of each day of receiving perceived futile treatment and converting to costs. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Prevalence of patients perceived to be receiving futile treatment. RESULTS: During a 3-month period, there were 6916 assessments by 36 critical care specialists of 1136 patients. Of these patients, 904 (80%) were never perceived to be receiving futile treatment, 98 (8.6%) were perceived as receiving probably futile treatment, 123 (11%) were perceived as receiving futile treatment, and 11 (1%) were perceived as receiving futile treatment only on the day they transitioned to palliative care. The patients with futile treatment assessments received 464 days of treatment perceived to be futile in critical care (range, 1-58 days), accounting for 6.7% of all assessed patient days in the 5 ICUs studied. Eighty-four of the 123 patients perceived as receiving futile treatment died before hospital discharge and 20 within 6 months of ICU care (6-month mortality rate of 85%), with survivors remaining in severely compromised health states. The cost of futile treatment in critical care was estimated at $2.6 million. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In 1 health system, treatment in critical care that is perceived to be futile is common and the cost is substantial.",Attitude of Health Personnel Critical Care/economics/psychology/*standards/statistics & numerical data Female Humans Intensive Care Units/economics/statistics & numerical data Male Medical Futility/*psychology Middle Aged Prospective Studies

How best to achieve this goal is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with lifestyle and intensive medical management to achieve control of comorbid risk factors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 12-month, 2-group unblinded randomized trial at 4 teaching hospitals in the United States and Taiwan involving 120 participants who had a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 8.0% or higher, body mass index (BMI) between 30.0 and 39.9, C peptide level of more than 1.0 ng/mL, and type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months. The study began in April 2008. INTERVENTIONS: Lifestyle-intensive medical management intervention and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. Medications for hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were prescribed according to protocol and surgical techniques that were standardized. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Composite goal of HbA1c less than 7.0%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg. RESULTS: All 120 patients received the intensive lifestyle-medical management protocol and 60 were randomly assigned to undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. After 12-months, 28 participants (49%; 95% CI, 36%-63%) in the gastric bypass group and 11 (19%; 95% CI, 10%-32%) in the lifestyle-medical management group achieved the primary end points (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; 95% CI, 1.9-11.7). Participants in the gastric bypass group required 3.0 fewer medications (mean, 1.7 vs 4.8; 95% CI for the difference, 2.3-3.6) and lost 26.1% vs 7.9% of their initial body weigh compared with the lifestyle-medical management group (difference, 17.5%; 95% CI, 14.2%-20.7%). Regression analyses indicated that achieving the composite end point was primarily attributable to weight loss. There were 22 serious adverse events in the gastric bypass group, including 1 cardiovascular event, and 15 in the lifestyle-medical management group. There were 4 perioperative complications and 6 late postoperative complications. The gastric bypass group experienced more nutritional deficiency than the lifestyle-medical management group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In mild to moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes, adding gastric bypass surgery to lifestyle and medical management was associated with a greater likelihood of achieving the composite goal. Potential benefits of adding gastric bypass surgery to the best lifestyle and medical management strategies of diabetes must be weighed against the risk of serious adverse events.

The CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) gene is involved in energy balance and obesity in animal models, but its role in human obesity is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether polymorphisms within the CRTC1 gene are associated with adiposity markers in psychiatric patients and the general population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective and prospective data analysis and population-based samples at Lausanne and Geneva university hospitals in Switzerland and a private clinic in Lausanne, Switzerland. The effect of 3 CRTC1 polymorphisms on body mass index (BMI) and/or fat mass was investigated in a discovery cohort of psychiatric outpatients taking weight gain-inducing psychotropic drugs (sample 1, n = 152). The CRTC1 variant that was significantly associated with BMI and survived Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparison was then replicated in 2 independent psychiatric samples (sample 2, n = 174 and sample 3, n = 118) and 2 white population-based samples (sample 4, n = 5338 and sample 5, n = 123,865). INTERVENTION: Noninterventional studies. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Difference in BMI and/or fat mass between CRTC1 genotype groups. RESULTS: Among the CRTC1 variants tested in the first psychiatric sample, only rs3746266A>G was associated with BMI (P(adjusted) = .003). In the 3 psychiatric samples, carriers of the rs3746266 G allele had a lower BMI than noncarriers (AA genotype) (sample 1, P = .001; sample 2, P = .05; and sample 3, P = .0003). In the combined analysis, excluding patients taking other weight gain-inducing drugs, G allele carriers (n = 98) had a 1.81-kg/m(2) lower BMI than noncarriers (n = 226; P < .0001). The strongest association was observed in women younger than 45 years, with a 3.87-kg/m(2) lower BMI in G allele carriers (n = 25) compared with noncarriers (n = 48; P < .0001), explaining 9% of BMI variance. In the population-based samples, the T allele of rs6510997C>T (a proxy of the rs3746266 G allele; r(2) = 0.7) was associated with lower BMI (sample 5, n = 123,865; P = .01) and fat mass (sample 4, n = 5338; P = .03). The strongest association with fat mass was observed in premenopausal women (n = 1192; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that CRTC1 contributes to the genetics of human obesity in psychiatric patients and the general population. Identification of high-risk subjects could contribute to a better individualization of the pharmacological treatment in psychiatry.","Adiposity/*genetics Adult *Body Mass Index Case-Control Studies Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics Humans Male Mental Disorders/complications/*genetics Obesity/complications/*genetics Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Transcription Factors/*genetics"

Experimental evidence implicates a role of RAF kinases in up-regulation of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2, cyclooxygenase 2), suggesting that BRAF-mutant colonic cells might be less sensitive to the antitumor effects of aspirin than BRAF-wild-type neoplastic cells. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the association of aspirin intake with colorectal cancer risk differs according to status of tumor BRAF oncogene mutation. DESIGN AND SETTING: We collected biennial questionnaire data on aspirin use and followed up participants in the Nurses' Health Study (from 1980) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (from 1986) until July 1, 2006, for cancer incidence and until January 1, 2012, for cancer mortality. Duplication-method Cox proportional cause-specific hazards regression for competing risks data was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for colorectal carcinoma incidence according to BRAF mutation status. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of colorectal cancer cases according to tumor BRAF mutation status. RESULTS: Among 127,865 individuals, with 3,165,985 person-years of follow-up, we identified 1226 incident rectal and colon cancers with available molecular data. Compared with nonuse, regular aspirin use was associated with lower BRAF-wild-type cancer risk (multivariable HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.83; age-adjusted incidence rate difference [RD], -9.7; 95% CI, -12.6 to -6.7 per 100,000 person-years). This association was observed irrespective of status of tumor PTGS2 expression or PIK3CA or KRAS mutation. In contrast, regular aspirin use was not associated with a lower risk of BRAF-mutated cancer (multivariable HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.38; age-adjusted, incidence RD, 0.7; 95% CI, -0.3 to 1.7 per 100,000 person-years: P for heterogeneity = .037, between BRAF-wild-type vs BRAF-mutated cancer risks). Compared with no aspirin use, aspirin use of more than 14 tablets per week was associated with a lower risk of BRAF-wild-type cancer (multivariable HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.75; age-adjusted incidence RD, -19.8; 95% CI, -26.3 to -13.3 per 100,000 person-years). The relationship between the number of aspirin tablets per week and colorectal cancer risk differed significantly by BRAF mutation status (P for heterogeneity = .005). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Regular aspirin use was associated with lower risk of BRAF-wild-type colorectal cancer but not with BRAF-mutated cancer risk. These findings suggest that BRAF-mutant colon tumor cells may be less sensitive to the effect of aspirin.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between rare protein-coding genetic variants and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in a large Latino population and to explore potential molecular and physiological mechanisms for the observed relationships. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed on DNA samples from 3756 Mexican and US Latino individuals (1794 with type 2 diabetes and 1962 without diabetes) recruited from 1993 to 2013. One variant was further tested for allele frequency and association with type 2 diabetes in large multiethnic data sets of 14,276 participants and characterized in experimental assays. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Secondary outcomes included age of onset, body mass index, and effect on protein function. RESULTS: A single rare missense variant (c.1522G>A [p.E508K]) was associated with type 2 diabetes prevalence (odds ratio [OR], 5.48; 95% CI, 2.83-10.61; P = 4.4 x 10(-7)) in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A), the gene responsible for maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3). This variant was observed in 0.36% of participants without type 2 diabetes and 2.1% of participants with it. In multiethnic replication data sets, the p.E508K variant was seen only in Latino patients (n = 1443 with type 2 diabetes and 1673 without it) and was associated with type 2 diabetes (OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 1.75-9.92; P = .0013). In experimental assays, HNF-1A protein encoding the p.E508K mutant demonstrated reduced transactivation activity of its target promoter compared with a wild-type protein. In our data, carriers and noncarriers of the p.E508K mutation with type 2 diabetes had no significant differences in compared clinical characteristics, including age at onset. The mean (SD) age for carriers was 45.3 years (11.2) vs 47.5 years (11.5) for noncarriers (P = .49) and the mean (SD) BMI for carriers was 28.2 (5.5) vs 29.3 (5.3) for noncarriers (P = .19). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a single low-frequency variant in the MODY3-causing gene HNF1A that is associated with type 2 diabetes in Latino populations and may affect protein function. This finding may have implications for screening and therapeutic modification in this population, but additional studies are required.","Adult Age of Onset Aged Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*genetics Female Genotype Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha/*genetics Hispanic Americans/genetics Humans Male Mexico Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Sequence Analysis, DNA United States"

Previous studies have suggested that the genetic factors predisposing to excess cardiovascular risk may be different in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic determinants of CHD that are specific to patients with diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 5 independent sets of CHD cases and CHD-negative controls from the Nurses' Health Study (enrolled in 1976 and followed up through 2008), Health Professionals Follow-up Study (enrolled in 1986 and followed up through 2008), Joslin Heart Study (enrolled in 2001-2008), Gargano Heart Study (enrolled in 2001-2008), and Catanzaro Study (enrolled in 2004-2010). Included were a total of 1517 CHD cases and 2671 CHD-negative controls, all with type 2 diabetes. Results in diabetic patients were compared with those in 737 nondiabetic CHD cases and 1637 nondiabetic CHD-negative controls from the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study cohorts. Exposures included 2,543,016 common genetic variants occurring throughout the genome. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Coronary heart disease--defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or angiographic evidence of significant stenosis of the coronary arteries. RESULTS: A variant on chromosome 1q25 (rs10911021) was consistently associated with CHD risk among diabetic participants, with risk allele frequencies of 0.733 in cases vs 0.679 in controls (odds ratio, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.22-1.51]; P = 2 x 10(-8)). No association between this variant and CHD was detected among nondiabetic participants, with risk allele frequencies of 0.697 in cases vs 0.696 in controls (odds ratio, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.87-1.13]; P = .89), consistent with a significant gene x diabetes interaction on CHD risk (P = 2 x 10(-4)). Compared with protective allele homozygotes, rs10911021 risk allele homozygotes were characterized by a 32% decrease in the expression of the neighboring glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL) gene in human endothelial cells (P = .0048). A decreased ratio between plasma levels of gamma-glutamyl cycle intermediates pyroglutamic and glutamic acid was also shown in risk allele homozygotes (P = .029).

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1), multidrug resistance (ABCB1), and catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) genes are associated with risk for opioid addiction in adults. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether SNPs in the OPRM1, ABCB1, and COMT genes are associated with length of hospital stay and the need for treatment of NAS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective multicenter cohort study conducted at 5 tertiary care centers and community hospitals in Massachusetts and Maine between July 2011 and July 2012. DNA samples were genotyped for SNPs, and then NAS outcomes were correlated with genotype. Eighty-six of 140 eligible mother-infant dyads were enrolled. Infants were eligible if they were 36 weeks' gestational age or older and exposed to methadone or buprenorphine in utero . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was length of hospital stay, with between-group differences expressed as beta and calculated with linear regression models. Secondary outcome measures included need for any medical treatment for NAS and treatment with 2 or more medications. RESULTS: Infants with the OPRM1 118A>G AG/GG genotype had shortened length of stay (beta = -8.5 days; 95% CI, -14.9 to -2.1 days; P = .009) and were less likely to receive any treatment than AA infants (48% vs 72%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63-0.96; P = .006). The COMT 158A>G AG/GG genotype was associated with shortened length of stay (beta = -10.8 days; 95% CI, -18.2 to -3.4 days; P = .005) and less treatment with 2 or more medications (18% vs 56%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.55-0.86; P = .001) than the AA genotype.

Postmortem evaluation fails to elucidate an underlying cause in many cases. Long QT syndrome (LQTS) may contribute to this problem. OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum and prevalence of mutations in the 3 most common LQTS susceptible genes (KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A) for a cohort of unexplained cases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: In this case series, retrospective postmortem genetic testing was conducted on a convenience sample of 91 unexplained intrauterine fetal deaths (mean [SD] estimated gestational age at fetal death, 26.3 [8.7] weeks) that were collected from 2006-2012 by the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, or the Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy. More than 1300 ostensibly healthy individuals served as controls. In addition, publicly available exome databases were assessed for the general population frequency of identified genetic variants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Comprehensive mutational analyses of KCNQ1 (KV7.1, LQTS type 1), KCNH2 (HERG/KV11.1, LQTS type 2), and SCN5A (NaV1.5, LQTS type 3) were performed using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct DNA sequencing on genomic DNA extracted from decedent tissue. Functional analyses of novel mutations were performed using heterologous expression and patch-clamp recording. RESULTS: The 3 putative LQTS susceptibility missense mutations (KCNQ1, p.A283T; KCNQ1, p.R397W; and KCNH2 [1b], p.R25W), with a heterozygous frequency of less than 0.05% in more than 10 000 publicly available exomes and absent in more than 1000 ethnically similar control patients, were discovered in 3 intrauterine fetal deaths (3.3% [95% CI, 0.68%-9.3%]). Both KV7.1-A283T (16-week male) and KV7.1-R397W (16-week female) mutations were associated with marked KV7.1 loss-of-function consistent with in utero LQTS type 1, whereas the HERG1b-R25W mutation (33.2-week male) exhibited a loss of function consistent with in utero LQTS type 2. In addition, 5 intrauterine fetal deaths hosted SCN5A rare nonsynonymous genetic variants (p.T220I, p.R1193Q, involving 2 cases, and p.P2006A, involving 2 cases) that conferred in vitro electrophysiological characteristics consistent with potentially proarrhythmic phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this molecular genetic evaluation of 91 cases of intrauterine fetal death, missense mutations associated with LQTS susceptibility were discovered in 3 cases (3.3%) and overall, genetic variants leading to dysfunctional LQTS-associated ion channels in vitro were discovered in 8 cases (8.8%). These preliminary findings may provide insights into mechanisms of some cases of stillbirth.","Autopsy *DNA Mutational Analysis Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/genetics/metabolism Female Fetal Death/*genetics Fetus/physiopathology Gene Expression Humans Infant, Newborn KCNQ1 Potassium Channel/genetics/metabolism Long QT Syndrome/*genetics Male *Mutation, Missense Myocardium/metabolism NAV1.5 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel/genetics/metabolism Retrospective Studies"

In addition to the potential for improving prognostic models, identifying genetic and molecular features that are associated with IPF mortality may provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of disease and inform clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the MUC5B promoter polymorphism (rs35705950), previously reported to be associated with the development of pulmonary fibrosis, is associated with survival in IPF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective study of survival in 2 independent cohorts of patients with IPF: the INSPIRE cohort, consisting of patients enrolled in the interferon-gamma1b trial (n = 438; December 15, 2003-May 2, 2009; 81 centers in 7 European countries, the United States, and Canada), and the Chicago cohort, consisting of IPF participants recruited from the Interstitial Lung Disease Clinic at the University of Chicago (n = 148; 2007-2010). The INSPIRE cohort was used to model the association of the MUC5B genotype with survival, accounting for the effect of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7) blood concentration and other demographic and clinical covariates. The Chicago cohort was used for replication of findings. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The numbers of patients in the GG, GT, and TT genotype groups were 148 (34%), 259 (59%), and 31 (7%), respectively, in the INSPIRE cohort and 41 (28%), 98 (66%), and 9 (6%), respectively, in the Chicago cohort. The median follow-up period was 1.6 years for INSPIRE and 2.1 years for Chicago. During follow-up, there were 73 deaths (36 GG, 35 GT, and 2 TT) among INSPIRE patients and 64 deaths (26 GG, 36 GT, and 2 TT) among Chicago patients. The unadjusted 2-year cumulative incidence of death was lower among patients carrying 1 or more copies of the IPF risk allele (T) in both the INSPIRE cohort (0.25 [95% CI, 0.17-0.32] for GG, 0.17 [95% CI, 0.11-0.23] for GT, and 0.03 [95% CI, 0.00-0.09] for TT) and the Chicago cohort (0.50 [95% CI, 0.31-0.63] for GG, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.13-0.31] for GT, and 0.11 [95% CI, 0.00-0.28] for TT). In the INSPIRE cohort, the TT and GT genotypes (risk for IPF) were associated with improved survival compared with GG (hazard ratios, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.10-0.52] and 0.48 [95% CI, 0.31-0.72], respectively; P < .001). This finding was replicated in the Chicago cohort (hazard ratios, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.05-0.49] and 0.39 [95% CI, 0.21-0.70], respectively; P < .002). The observed association of MUC5B with survival was independent of age, sex, forced vital capacity, diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide, MMP-7, and treatment status. The addition of the MUC5B genotype to the survival models significantly improved the predictive accuracy of the model in both the INSPIRE cohort (C = 0.71 [95% CI, 0.64-0.75] vs C = 0.68 [95% CI, 0.61-0.73]; P < .001) and the Chicago cohort (C = 0.73 [95% CI, 0.62-0.78] vs C = 0.69 [95% CI, 0.59-0.75]; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with IPF, a common risk polymorphism in MUC5B was significantly associated with improved survival. Further research is necessary to refine the risk estimates and to determine the clinical implications of these findings.","Aged Cohort Studies Female Genotype Humans Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis/*genetics/*mortality Male Middle Aged Mucin-5B/*genetics *Polymorphism, Genetic Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics Retrospective Studies Risk Survival Analysis"

Substrate 25-hydroxyvitamin D must be converted to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D for full biological activity, and complex metabolic pathways suggest that interindividual variability in vitamin D metabolism may alter the clinical consequences of measured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether common variation within genes encoding the vitamin D-binding protein, megalin, cubilin, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) modify associations of low 25-hydroxyvitamin D with major clinical outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Examination of 141 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a discovery cohort of 1514 white participants (who were recruited from 4 US regions) from the community-based Cardiovascular Health Study. Participants had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurements in 1992-1993 and were followed up for a median of 11 years (through 2006). Replication meta-analyses were conducted across the independent, community-based US Health, Aging, and Body Composition (n = 922; follow-up: 1998-1999 through 2005), Italian Invecchiare in Chianti (n = 835; follow-up: 1998-2000 through 2006), and Swedish Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (n = 970; follow-up: 1991-1995 through 2008) cohort studies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Composite outcome of incident hip facture, myocardial infarction, cancer, and mortality over long-term follow-up. RESULTS: Interactions between 5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and low 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration were identified in the discovery phase and 1 involving a variant in the VDR gene replicated in independent meta-analysis. Among Cardiovascular Health Study participants, low 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was associated with hazard ratios for risk of the composite outcome of 1.40 (95% CI, 1.12-1.74) for those who had 1 minor allele at rs7968585 and 1.82 (95% CI, 1.31-2.54) for those with 2 minor alleles at rs7968585. In contrast, there was no evidence of an association (estimated hazard ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.70-1.24]) among participants who had 0 minor alleles at this single-nucleotide polymorphism. CONCLUSION: Known associations of low 25-hydroxyvitamin D with major health outcomes may vary according to common genetic differences in the vitamin D receptor.","25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase/genetics Aged Chronic Disease/*mortality Cohort Studies Female *Genetic Variation Genotype Hip Fractures/mortality Humans Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-2/genetics Male Meta-Analysis as Topic Myocardial Infarction/mortality Neoplasms/mortality Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Receptors, Calcitriol/*genetics Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics Risk Steroid Hydroxylases/genetics Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/blood/metabolism"

H. pylori prevalence is as high as 90% in some developing countries but 10% of a given population is never colonized, regardless of exposure. Genetic factors are hypothesized to confer H. pylori susceptibility. OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic loci associated with H. pylori seroprevalence in 2 independent population-based cohorts and to determine their putative pathophysiological role by whole-blood RNA gene expression profiling. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Two independent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and a subsequent meta-analysis were conducted for anti-H. pylori IgG serology in the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) (recruitment, 1997-2001 [n = 3830]) as well as the Rotterdam Study (RS-I) (recruitment, 1990-1993) and RS-II (recruitment, 2000-2001 [n = 7108]) populations. Whole-blood RNA gene expression profiles were analyzed in RS-III (recruitment, 2006-2008 [n = 762]) and SHIP-TREND (recruitment, 2008-2012 [n = 991]), and fecal H. pylori antigen in SHIP-TREND (n = 961). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: H. pylori seroprevalence. RESULTS: Of 10,938 participants, 6160 (56.3%) were seropositive for H. pylori. GWASs identified the toll-like receptor (TLR) locus (4p14; top-ranked single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs10004195; P = 1.4 x 10(-18); odds ratio, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.76]) and the FCGR2A locus (1q23.3; top-ranked SNP, rs368433; P = 2.1 x 10(-8); odds ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.81]) as associated with H. pylori seroprevalence. Among the 3 TLR genes at 4p14, only TLR1 was differentially expressed per copy number of the minor rs10004195-A allele (beta = -0.23 [95% CI, -0.34 to -0.11]; P = 2.1 x 10(-4)). Individuals with high fecal H. pylori antigen titers (optical density >1) also exhibited the highest 25% of TLR1 expression levels (P = .01 by chi2 test). Furthermore, TLR1 exhibited an Asn248Ser substitution in the extracellular domain strongly linked to the rs10004195 SNP. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: GWAS meta-analysis identified an association between TLR1 and H. pylori seroprevalence, a finding that requires replication in nonwhite populations. If confirmed, genetic variations in TLR1 may help explain some of the observed variation in individual risk for H. pylori infection.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antigens, Bacterial Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies Female Genetic Loci *Genetic Predisposition to Disease *Genome-Wide Association Study Germany/epidemiology Helicobacter Infections/epidemiology/*genetics Helicobacter pylori/*isolation & purification Humans Male Middle Aged Netherlands/epidemiology Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Prevalence Seroepidemiologic Studies Toll-Like Receptor 1/*genetics Young Adult"
23978990,Evidence of recessive Alzheimer disease loci in a Caribbean Hispanic data set: genome-wide survey of runs of homozygosity.,JAMA Neurol,Ghani M and Sato C and Lee JH and Reitz C and Moreno D and Mayeux R and St George-Hyslop P and Rogaeva E,Missing,"IMPORTANCE The search for novel Alzheimer disease (AD) genes or pathologic mutations within known AD loci is ongoing. The development of array technologies has helped to identify rare recessive mutations among long runs of homozygosity (ROHs), in which both parental alleles are identical. Caribbean Hispanics are known to have an elevated risk for AD and tend to have large families with evidence of inbreeding. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that the late-onset AD in a Caribbean Hispanic population might be explained in part by the homozygosity of unknown loci that could harbor recessive AD risk haplotypes or pathologic mutations. DESIGN We used genome-wide array data to identify ROHs (&gt;1 megabase) and conducted global burden and locus-specific ROH analyses. SETTING A whole-genome case-control ROH study. PARTICIPANTS A Caribbean Hispanic data set of 547 unrelated cases (48.8% with familial AD) and 542 controls collected from a population known to have a 3-fold higher risk of AD vs non-Hispanics in the same community. Based on a Structure program analysis, our data set consisted of African Hispanic (207 cases and 192 controls) and European Hispanic (329 cases and 326 controls) participants. EXPOSURE Alzheimer disease risk genes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We calculated the total and mean lengths of the ROHs per sample. Global burden measurements among autosomal chromosomes were investigated in cases vs controls. Pools of overlapping ROH segments (consensus regions) were identified, and the case to control ratio was calculated for each consensus region. We formulated the tested hypothesis before data collection. RESULTS In total, we identified 17 137 autosomal regions with ROHs. The mean length of the ROH per person was significantly greater in cases vs controls (P = .0039), and this association was stronger with familial AD (P = .0005). Among the European Hispanics, a consensus region at the EXOC4 locus was significantly associated with AD even after correction for multiple testing (empirical P value 1 [EMP1], .0001; EMP2, .002; 21 AD cases vs 2 controls). Among the African Hispanic subset, the most significant but nominal association was observed for CTNNA3, a well-known AD gene candidate (EMP1, .002; 10 AD cases vs 0 controls). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our results show that ROHs could significantly contribute to the etiology of AD. Future studies would require the analysis of larger, relatively inbred data sets that might reveal novel recessive AD genes. The next step is to conduct sequencing of top significant loci in a subset of samples with overlapping ROHs.","Age of Onset Aged Aged, 80 and over Alzheimer Disease/*genetics Caribbean Region Case-Control Studies Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics *Genome-Wide Association Study Hispanic Americans/genetics *Homozygote Humans Male Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Vesicular Transport Proteins/genetics"

However, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult, particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an outbreak strain. OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of DNA extracted from microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: In a retrospective investigation, 45 samples were selected from fecal specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) O104:H4 in Germany. Samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (August-September 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (November 2012-February 2013). In phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. In phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. In phase 3, sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak strain. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The recovery of genome sequence data for the purposes of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and other pathogens from fecal samples. RESULTS: During phase 1, a draft genome of the STEC outbreak strain was obtained. During phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. Sequences from the Shiga-toxin genes were detected in 27 of 40 STEC-positive samples (67%). In phase 3, sequences from Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter concisus, and Salmonella enterica were recovered. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of diarrheal disease. Challenges include improving diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing costs.","Computational Biology/methods DNA, Bacterial/analysis Diarrhea *Disease Outbreaks Escherichia coli Infections/*diagnosis/microbiology Feces/microbiology Humans Metagenomics/*methods Retrospective Studies Sensitivity and Specificity Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods Shiga Toxin/genetics Shiga-Toxigenic Escherichia coli/*genetics/isolation & purification Time Factors"
25111196,Nonsterile Glove Use in Addition to Hand Hygiene to Prevent Late-Onset Infection in Preterm Infants: Randomized Clinical Trial.,JAMA Pediatr,Kaufman DA and Blackman A and Conaway MR and Sinkin RA,Missing,"Importance: Late-onset infections commonly occur in extremely preterm infants and are associated with high rates of mortality and neurodevelopmental impairment. Hand hygiene alone does not always achieve the desired clean hands, as microorganisms are still present more than 50% of the time. We hypothesize that glove use after hand hygiene may further decrease these infections. Objective: To determine if nonsterile glove use after hand hygiene before all patient and intravenous catheter contact, compared with hand hygiene alone, prevents late-onset infections in preterm infants. Design, Settings, and Participants: A prospective, single-center, clinical, randomized trial was conducted in infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit who weighed less than 1000 g and/or had a gestational age of less than 29 weeks and were less than 8 days old. There were 175 eligible infants, of which 120 were enrolled during a 30-month period from December 8, 2008, to June 20, 2011. Interventions: Infants were randomly assigned to receive care with nonsterile gloves after hand hygiene (group A) or care after hand hygiene alone (group B) before all patient and intravenous line (central and peripheral) contact. Study intervention was continued while patients had central or peripheral venous access. Main Outcomes and Measures: One or more episodes of late-onset (>72 hours of age) infection in the bloodstream, urinary tract, or cerebrospinal fluid or necrotizing enterocolitis. Results: The 2 groups were similar in baseline demographic characteristics. Late-onset invasive infection or necrotizing enterocolitis occurred in 32% of infants (19 of 60) in group A compared with 45% of infants (27 of 60) in group B (difference, -12%; 95% CI, -28% to 6%; P = .13). In group A compared with group B, there were 53% fewer gram-positive bloodstream infections (15% [9 of 60] vs 32% [19 of 60]; difference, -17%; 95% CI, -31% to -1%; P = .03) and 64% fewer central line-associated bloodstream infections (3.4 vs 9.4 per 1000 central line days; ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.81; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance: Glove use after hand hygiene prior to patient and line contact is associated with fewer gram-positive bloodstream infections and possible central line-associated bloodstream infections in preterm infants. This readily implementable infection control measure may result in decreased infections in high-risk preterm infants. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01729000.",Missing

Previous studies have raised the possibility that glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP-1)-based therapies, including a GLP-1 mimetic (exenatide) and a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (sitagliptin phosphate), may increase the risk of acute pancreatitis. OBJECTIVE: To test whether GLP-1-based therapies such as exenatide and sitagliptin are associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis. We used conditional logistic regression to analyze the data. DESIGN: Population-based case-control study. SETTING: A large administrative database in the United States from February 1, 2005, through December 31, 2008. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 18 to 64 years. We identified 1269 hospitalized cases with acute pancreatitis using a validated algorithm and 1269 control subjects matched for age category, sex, enrollment pattern, and diabetes complications. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hospitalization for acute pancreatitis. RESULTS: The mean age of included individuals was 52 years, and 57.45% were male. Cases were significantly more likely than controls to have hypertriglyceridemia (12.92% vs 8.35%), alcohol use (3.23% vs 0.24%), gallstones (9.06% vs 1.34), tobacco abuse (16.39% vs 5.52%), obesity (19.62% vs 9.77%), biliary and pancreatic cancer (2.84% vs 0%), cystic fibrosis (0.79% vs 0%), and any neoplasm (29.94% vs 18.05%). After adjusting for available confounders and metformin hydrochloride use, current use of GLP-1-based therapies within 30 days (adjusted odds ratio, 2.24 [95% CI, 1.36-3.68]) and recent use past 30 days and less than 2 years (2.01 [1.37-3.18]) were associated with significantly increased odds of acute pancreatitis relative to the odds in nonusers.

The relationship among diabetes mellitus, insulin, and AD is an important area of investigation. However, whether cognitive impairment seen in those with diabetes is mediated by excess pathological features of AD or other related abnormalities, such as vascular disease, remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between serial measures of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance and in vivo brain beta-amyloid burden, measured with carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (11C-PiB), and AD pathology at autopsy. DESIGN: Scores calculated from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) and Braak criteria were correlated with measures of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance in 197 participants who underwent autopsy after death and who had undergone 2 or more oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) using grouped analyses and a continuous mixed-models analysis. The same measures of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance were also correlated with brain 11C-PiB retention in an additional 53 living subjects from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging neuroimaging study. SETTING: Prospective, serially assessed cohort of community-dwelling subjects. PARTICIPANTS: Cohort 1 consisted of 197 participants enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging who had 2 or more OGTTs during life and a complete brain autopsy after death. Cohort 2 consisted of 53 living subjects who had 2 or more OGTTs and underwent brain 11C-PiB positron emission tomography. EXPOSURES: Autopsy and 11C-PiB positron emission tomography. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The correlation of brain markers of AD, including CERAD score, Braak score, and 11C-PiB retention, with serum markers of glucose homeostasis using grouped and continuous mixed-models analyses. RESULTS: We found no significant correlations between measures of brain AD pathology or 11C-PiB beta-amyloid load and glucose intolerance or insulin resistance in subjects who had a mean (SD) of 6.4 (3.2) OGTTs during 22.1 (8.0) years of follow-up. Thirty subjects with frank diabetes mellitus who received medications also had AD pathology scores that were similar to those of the cohort as a whole. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prospective cohort with multiple assessments of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, measures of glucose and insulin homeostasis are not associated with AD pathology and likely play little role in AD pathogenesis. Long-term therapeutic trials are important to elucidate this issue.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Aging Alzheimer Disease/metabolism/*pathology/radionuclide imaging Baltimore Benzothiazoles Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology/radionuclide imaging Female Glucose Intolerance/*pathology Humans *Insulin Resistance/physiology Longitudinal Studies Male Prospective Studies"

The effect of increased travel on access and outcomes from these services is not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between distance from a Veterans Affairs (VA) transplant center (VATC) and access to being waitlisted for liver transplantation, actually having a liver transplant, and mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective study of veterans meeting liver transplantation eligibility criteria from January 1, 2003, until December 31, 2010, using data from the Veterans Health Administration's integrated, national, electronic medical record linked to Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data.

In multivariable models, increasing distance to closest VATC was associated with significantly lower odds of being waitlisted at a VATC (odds ratio [OR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.89-0.93] for each doubling in distance) or any transplant center (OR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.92-0.96] for each doubling in distance). For example, a veteran living 25 miles from a VATC would have a 7.4% (95% CI, 6.6%-8.1%) adjusted probability of being waitlisted, whereas a veteran 100 miles from a VATC would have a 6.2% (95% CI, 5.7%-6.6%) adjusted probability. In adjusted models, increasing distance from a VATC was associated with significantly lower transplantation rates (subhazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98 for each doubling in distance). There was significantly increased mortality among waitlisted veterans from the time of first hepatic decompensation event in multivariable survival models (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04 for each doubling in distance). For example, a waitlisted veteran living 25 miles from a VATC would have a 62.9% (95% CI, 59.1%-66.1%) 5-year adjusted probability of survival from first hepatic decompensation event compared with a 59.8% (95% CI, 56.3%-63.1%) 5-year adjusted probability of survival for a veteran living 100 miles from a VATC. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among VA patients meeting eligibility criteria for liver transplantation, greater distance from a VATC or any transplant center was associated with lower likelihood of being waitlisted, receiving a liver transplant, and greater likelihood of death. The relationship between these findings and centralizing specialized care deserves further investigation.",Delivery of Health Care/trends Female Health Services Accessibility/*statistics & numerical data Humans Liver Transplantation/*mortality Male Middle Aged Retrospective Studies Risk Survival Analysis *Travel United States/epidemiology Veterans/*statistics & numerical data *Waiting Lists
25054690,Disparities in adverse childhood experiences among individuals with a history of military service.,JAMA Psychiatry,Blosnich JR and Dichter ME and Cerulli C and Batten SV and Bossarte RM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with several adulthood health problems, such as self-directed violence. For some individuals, enlistment in the military may be an instrumental act to escape adverse household environments; however, to our knowledge prevalence of ACEs among persons with a history of military service has not been documented in the United States using population-based data. OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of ACEs among individuals with and without a history of military service. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data are from the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted with population-based samples of noninstitutionalized US adults from January 1 through December 31, 2010. Analyses were limited to respondents who received the ACE module (n = 60 598). Participants were categorized by history of military service and whether a respondent was 18 years of age in 1973. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: History of military service was defined by active duty service, veteran status, or training for the Reserves or National Guard. The ACE inventory assessed 11 negative experiences before the age of 18 years. Weighted chi2 tests and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine differences in ACEs by history of military service, era of service, and sex. RESULTS: Those with military experience had greater odds of any difference in prevalence of ACEs. In the all-volunteer era, men with military service had a higher prevalence of ACEs in all 11 categories than men without military service. Notably, in the all-volunteer era, men with military service had twice the odds of reporting forced sex before the age of 18 years (odds ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.34-3.57) compared with men without military service. In the draft era, the only difference among men was household drug use, in which men with a history of military service had a significantly lower prevalence than men without a history of military service (2.1% vs 3.3%; P = .003). Fewer differences were observed among women in the all-volunteer and draft eras. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Differences in ACEs by era and sex lend preliminary support that enlistment may serve as an escape from adversity for some individuals, at least among men. Further research is needed to understand how best to support service members and veterans who may have experienced ACEs.",Missing
23784556,Maternal depressive symptoms and children's emotional problems: can early child care help children of depressed mothers?,JAMA Psychiatry,Herba CM and Tremblay RE and Boivin M and Liu X and Mongeau C and Seguin JR and Cote SM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Maternal depression is a major risk factor for the development of children's mental health problems. No population-based study to date has examined whether early child care spanning the full preschool period from infancy onward is protective for children of depressed mothers. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether early child care moderates associations between maternal depressive symptoms (MDSs) and child internalizing problems (emotional problems [EPs], separation anxiety symptoms, and social withdrawal symptoms [SWSs]) during the preschool period. DESIGN AND SETTING: Population-based prospective cohort study within the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development. PARTICIPANTS: Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development participants (n = 1759) assessed repeatedly between ages 5 and 60 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: High-level trajectories of EPs, SWSs, and separation anxiety symptoms between ages 17 and 60 months. RESULTS: Child care age at entry moderated associations between MDSs and child internalizing problems. Among children of mothers with elevated MDSs, reduced odds ratios for EPs and SWSs were found for those entering child care early (0.24; 95% CI, 0.09-0.66 for EPs and 0.29; 95% CI, 0.09-0.92 for SWSs) or late (0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.77 for EPs and 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.65 for SWSs) compared with those remaining in maternal care. Child care type moderated the association between MDSs and child EPs; children of mothers with elevated MDSs who received group-based child care had lower odds ratios for EPs than those who remained in maternal care (0.21; 95% CI, 0.09-0.48) or those who were cared for by a relative or babysitter (0.40; 95% CI, 0.17-0.94). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Regulated early child care services reduced the risks for internalizing problems for children of mothers with elevated MDSs. Regulated child care services may be used as a public health intervention to buffer the negative effect of maternal depression on children's internalizing problems.","Anxiety, Separation/prevention & control/psychology Child Care/*psychology Child of Impaired Parents/*psychology Child, Preschool Depression/*psychology Emotions/physiology Female Humans Infant Internal-External Control Male Mothers/*psychology Preventive Health Services/*utilization Prospective Studies Quebec Social Behavior Time Factors"
25038357,Effect of tesamorelin on visceral fat and liver fat in HIV-infected patients with abdominal fat accumulation: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Stanley TL and Feldpausch MN and Oh J and Branch KL and Lee H and Torriani M and Grinspoon SK,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), visceral adiposity is associated with metabolic dysregulation and ectopic fat accumulation. Tesamorelin, a growth hormone-releasing hormone analog, specifically targets visceral fat reduction but its effects on liver fat are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of tesamorelin on visceral and liver fat. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 50 antiretroviral-treated HIV-infected men and women with abdominal fat accumulation at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The first patient was enrolled on January 10, 2011; for the final patient, the 6-month study visit was completed on September 6, 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive tesamorelin, 2 mg (n=28), or placebo (n=22), subcutaneously daily for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end points were changes in visceral adipose tissue and liver fat. Secondary end points included glucose levels and other metabolic end points. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients received treatment with study drug. Tesamorelin significantly reduced visceral adipose tissue (mean change, -34 cm2 [95% CI, -53 to -15 cm2] with tesamorelin vs 8 cm2 [95% CI, -14 to 30 cm2] with placebo; treatment effect, -42 cm2 [95% CI, -71 to -14 cm2]; P = .005) and liver fat (median change in lipid to water percentage, -2.0% [interquartile range {IQR}, -6.4% to 0.1%] with tesamorelin vs 0.9% [IQR, -0.6% to 3.7%] with placebo; P = .003) over 6 months, for a net treatment effect of -2.9% in lipid to water percentage. Fasting glucose increased in the tesamorelin group at 2 weeks (mean change, 9 mg/dL [95% CI, 5-13 mg/dL] vs 2 mg/dL [95% CI, -3 to 8 mg/dL] in the placebo group; treatment effect, 7 mg/dL [95% CI, 1-14 mg/dL]; P = .03), but changes at 6 months in fasting glucose (mean change, 4 mg/dL [95% CI, -2 to 10 mg/dL] with tesamorelin vs 2 mg/dL [95% CI, -4 to 7 mg/dL] with placebo; treatment effect, 2 mg/dL [95% CI, -6 to 10 mg/dL]; P = .72 overall across time points) and 2-hour glucose (mean change, -1 mg/dL [95% CI, -18 to 15 mg/dL] vs -8 mg/dL [95% CI, -24 to 8 mg/dL], respectively; treatment effect, 7 mg/dL [95% CI, -16 to 29 mg/dL]; P = .53 overall across time points) were not significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this preliminary study of HIV-infected patients with abdominal fat accumulation, tesamorelin administered for 6 months was associated with reductions in visceral fat and additionally with modest reductions in liver fat.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether women or men with migraine (with and without aura) have a higher incidence of brain lesions 9 years after initial MRI, whether migraine frequency was associated with progression of brain lesions, and whether progression of brain lesions was associated with cognitive decline. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a follow-up of the 2000 Cerebral Abnormalities in Migraine, an Epidemiological Risk Analysis cohort, a prospective population-based observational study of Dutch participants with migraine and an age- and sex-matched control group, 203 of the 295 baseline participants in the migraine group and 83 of 140 in the control group underwent MRI scan in 2009 to identify progression of MRI-measured brain lesions. Comparisons were adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, and educational level. The participants in the migraine group were a mean 57 years (range, 43-72 years), and 71% were women. Those in the control group were a mean 55 years (range, 44-71 years), and 69% were women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Progression of MRI-measured cerebral deep white matter hyperintensities, infratentorial hyperintensities, and posterior circulation territory infarctlike lesions. Change in cognition was also measured. RESULTS: Of the 145 women in the migraine group, 112 (77%) vs 33 of 55 women (60%) in the control group had progression of deep white matter hyperintensities (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95%CI, 1.0-4.1; P = .04). There were no significant associations of migraine with progression of infratentorial hyperintensities: 21 participants (15%) in the migraine group and 1 of 57 participants (2%) in the control group showed progression (adjusted OR, 7.7; 95% CI, 1.0-59.5; P = .05) or new posterior circulation territory infarctlike lesions: 10 of 203 participants (5%) in the migraine group but none of 83 in the control group (P = .07). There was no association of number or frequency of migraine headaches with progression of lesions. There was no significant association of high vs nonhigh deep white matter hyperintensity load with change in cognitive scores (-3.7 in the migraine group vs 1.4 in the control group; 95% CI, -4.4 to 0.2; adjusted P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: In a community-based cohort followed up after 9 years, women with migraine had a higher incidence of deep white matter hyperintensities but did not have significantly higher progression of other MRI-measured brain changes.

23989246,"A survey of current practices, attitudes, and knowledge regarding human papillomavirus-related cancers and vaccines among head and neck surgeons.",JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Malloy KM and Ellender SM and Goldenberg D and Dolan RW,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Understanding head and neck surgeons' current knowledge, practices, and opinions regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) education and prevention will enable efforts to assist surgeons in this important endeavor. OBJECTIVE: To assess knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of head and neck surgeons regarding HPV education and vaccination. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Online survey of members of the American Head and Neck Society (AHNS) in late 2011 and early 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Knowledge, attitudes, and current practices regarding HPV education and vaccination. RESULTS: All 1081 members of the AHNS were approached via e-mail, and 297 members completed the survey, for an overall response rate of 27.5%. Most respondents were male (86.2%) fellowship-trained head and neck surgeons (80.4%), and most practice in an academic setting (77.1%) in the United States (78.1%). More than 90% of respondents discuss risk factors for head and neck cancer and HPV as a specific risk factor with their patients. However, only 49.1% discuss the importance of vaccinating preadolescents for HPV, most commonly citing that they do not do so because their patients are adults (38.7%). Of those respondents with daughters, 68.9% reported that their daughters had received or they intend their daughters to receive the HPV vaccine. Of those respondents with sons, only 55.8% reported that their sons had been vaccinated or they intend for them to be. Respondents reported divergent attitudes toward HPV vaccination safety and efficacy. However, respondents were overwhelmingly supportive of possible future ANHS activities to educate clinicians, increase public awareness, educate patients, and advocate for health policy related to HPV. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Head and neck surgeons are knowledgeable about HPV and show generally positive attitudes and beliefs about HPV education and vaccination. They endorse AHNS actions to improve public and patient education, as well as health policy on HPV. These findings support AHNS developing a strategic plan and actions to improve knowledge and reduce HPV infection among the American public.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors *Attitude of Health Personnel Cancer Vaccines Child *Clinical Competence Female Head and Neck Neoplasms/prevention & control/surgery/*virology Health Care Surveys Humans Male Papillomavirus Infections/pathology/*prevention & control *Papillomavirus Vaccines Patient Education as Topic Patient Selection *Physician's Practice Patterns Sex Factors *Specialties, Surgical Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control/virology"
24008599,Combined changing patterns of hospital utilization for head and neck cancer care: implications for future care.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Bhattacharyya N and Abemayor E,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The care of patients with head and neck cancer is labor and cost intensive. Although several studies have focused on clinical outcomes with regionalization of care of such patients, it remains uncertain if and where such concentrations of care are occurring. A better understanding of how care is distributed will improve our understanding of the financial and educational impact of compacting treatment of these patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine if regionalization of head and neck cancer care has occurred over the past decade with respect to hospital size and teaching hospital status. DESIGN AND SETTING: Secondary analysis of national health care database. PARTICIPANTS: All inpatient admissions with a primary head and neck cancer diagnosis contained within the Nationwide Inpatient Sample during the calendar years 2000, 2005, and 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The percentage distributions of head and neck cancer cases with respect to hospital teaching status, hospital bed size, and primary payer were compared according to calendar year to determine temporal changes. Multivariate analysis was conducted to determine year-to-year changes in proportion of head neck cancer admissions, controlling for geographic region, hospital bed size, and expected source of payment. RESULTS: The estimated inpatient hospital head and neck cancer stays in the United States in 2000, 2005, and 2010 (with standard error of the national estimate) were 28,862 (2067), 33,517 (3080), and 37,354 (4194), respectively. The percentage of admissions to teaching hospitals increased from 61.7% to 64.2% and 79.8%, respectively. Similarly, the percentage (with standard error) of cases in large-bed-size hospitals increased from 69.2% (2.8%) to 71.4% (3.8%) and 73.3% (4.8%), respectively. The primary expected payer distribution did not change significantly over the study (Medicare, 39.6% [1.4%]; Medicaid, 17.4% [2.2%]; private insurance, 33.3% [2.4%]; and other, 9.7% [1.5%] in 2010). The adjusted odds ratio for head neck cancer case being admitted to a teaching institution for 2010 vs 2000 was 2.5 (95% CI, 1.6-3.7). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Head and neck oncologic care is increasingly being regionalized to teaching hospitals and academic centers. Such regionalization also has important implications for future education of residents and measures of achieved competency.","Head and Neck Neoplasms/*therapy Health Facility Size Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data/trends Hospitals, Teaching Humans Insurance Coverage/*statistics & numerical data Insurance, Health, Reimbursement/*statistics & numerical data Medical Oncology/*organization & administration Regional Medical Programs/*organization & administration Retrospective Studies United States"
24382595,Smoking status and health care costs in the perioperative period: a population-based study.,JAMA Surg,Warner DO and Borah BJ and Moriarty J and Schroeder DR and Shi Y and Shah ND,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Cigarette smoking adds an estimated $100 billion in annual incremental direct health care costs nationwide. Cigarette smoking increases complication risk in surgical patients, but the potential effects of smoking status on perioperative health care costs are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that current and former smoking at the time of admission for inpatient surgery, compared with never smoking, are independently associated with higher incremental health care costs for the surgical episode and the first year after hospital discharge. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based, propensity-matched cohort study, with cohort membership based on smoking status (current smokers, former smokers, and never smokers) was performed at Mayo Clinic in Rochester (a tertiary care center) and included patients at least 18 years old who lived in Olmsted County, Minnesota, for at least 1 year before and after the index surgery. EXPOSURE: Undergoing an inpatient surgical procedure at Mayo Clinic hospitals between April 1, 2008, and December 31, 2009. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Total costs during the index surgical episode and 1 year after hospital discharge, with the latter standardized as costs per month. Costs were measured using the Olmsted County Healthcare Expenditure and Utilization Database, a claims-based database including information on medical resource use, associated charges, and estimated economic costs for patients receiving care at the 2 medical groups (Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center) that provide most medical services within Olmsted County, Minnesota. RESULTS: Propensity matching resulted in 678 matched pairs in the current vs never smoker grouping and 945 pairs in the former vs never smoker grouping. Compared with never smokers, adjusted costs for the index hospitalization did not differ significantly for current or former smokers. However, the adjusted costs in the year after hospitalization were significantly higher for current and former smokers based on regression analysis (predicted monthly difference of $400 [95% CI, $131-$669] and $273 [95% CI, $56-$490] for current and former smokers, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with never smokers, health care costs during the first year after hospital discharge for an inpatient surgical procedure are higher in both former and current smokers, although the cost of the index hospitalization is not affected by smoking status.",Adult Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) Female Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data Hospitalization/economics Humans Male Matched-Pair Analysis Middle Aged Minnesota Perioperative Period/*economics Propensity Score Smoking/*economics

Little is known about the influence of diet on the incidence or progression of CKD among individuals with type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between (healthy) diet, alcohol, protein, and sodium intake, and incidence or progression of CKD among individuals with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: All 6213 individuals with type 2 diabetes without macroalbuminuria from the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination With Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) were included in this observational study. Recruitment spanned from January 2002 to July 2003, with prospective follow-up through January 2008. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Chronic kidney disease was defined as new microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria or glomerular filtration rate decline of more than 5% per year at 5.5 years of follow-up. We assessed diet using the modified Alternate Healthy Eating Index (mAHEI). The analyses were adjusted for known risk factors, and competing risk of death was considered. RESULTS: After 5.5 years of follow-up, 31.7% of participants had developed CKD and 8.3% had died. Compared with participants in the least healthy tertile of mAHEI score, participants in the healthiest tertile had a lower risk of CKD (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.84) and lower risk of mortality (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.48-0.78). Participants consuming more than 3 servings of fruits per week had a lower risk of CKD compared with participants consuming these food items less frequently. Participants in the lowest tertile of total and animal protein intake had an increased risk of CKD compared with participants in the highest tertile (total protein OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.30). Sodium intake was not associated with CKD. Moderate alcohol intake reduced the risk of CKD (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65-0.87) and mortality (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53-0.89). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A healthy diet and moderate intake of alcohol may decrease the incidence or progression of CKD among individuals with type 2 diabetes.

24700303,The influence of hearing aids on the speech and language development of children with hearing loss.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Tomblin JB and Oleson JJ and Ambrose SE and Walker E and Moeller MP,Missing,"IMPORTANCE Hearing loss (HL) in children can be deleterious to their speech and language development. The standard of practice has been early provision of hearing aids (HAs) to moderate these effects; however, there have been few empirical studies evaluating the effectiveness of this practice on speech and language development among children with mild-to-severe HL. OBJECTIVE To investigate the contributions of aided hearing and duration of HA use to speech and language outcomes in children with mild-to-severe HL. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An observational cross-sectional design was used to examine the association of aided hearing levels and length of HA use with levels of speech and language outcomes. One hundred eighty 3- and 5-year-old children with HL were recruited through records of Universal Newborn Hearing Screening and referrals from clinical service providers in the general community in 6 US states. INTERVENTIONS All but 4 children had been fitted with HAs, and measures of aided hearing and the duration of HA use were obtained. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Standardized measures of speech and language ability were obtained. RESULTS Measures of the gain in hearing ability for speech provided by the HA were significantly correlated with levels of speech (rho179 = 0.20; P = .008) and language: rho155 = 0.21; P = .01) ability. These correlations were indicative of modest levels of association between aided hearing and speech and language outcomes. These benefits were found for children with mild and moderate-to-severe HL. In addition, the amount of benefit from aided hearing interacted with the duration of HA experience (Speech: F4,161 = 4.98; P &lt; .001; Language: F4,138 = 2.91; P &lt; .02). Longer duration of HA experience was most beneficial for children who had the best aided hearing. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The degree of improved hearing provided by HAs was associated with better speech and language development in children. In addition, the duration of HA experience interacted with the aided hearing to influence outcomes. These results provide support for the provision of well-fitted HAs to children with HL. In particular, the findings support early HA fitting and HA provision to children with mild HL.","Child Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Equipment Design Female Follow-Up Studies Hearing/*physiology *Hearing Aids Hearing Loss/diagnosis/physiopathology/*rehabilitation Hearing Tests Humans Infant *Language Development Male Prognosis Severity of Illness Index Speech/*physiology"

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of and risk factors for depression among adults with hearing loss. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 18 years or older (N = 18 318) who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2005-2010, a nationally representative sample. INTERVENTIONS: Multistage probability sampling of US population. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Depression, assessed by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale, and hearing impairment (HI), assessed by self-report and audiometric examination for adults aged 70 years or older. RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate to severe depression (PHQ-9 score, >/=10) was 4.9% for individuals reporting excellent hearing, 7.1% for those with good hearing, and 11.4% for participants who reported a little trouble or greater HI. Using excellent hearing as the reference, after adjusting for all covariates, multivariate odds ratios (ORs) for depression were 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1-1.8) for good hearing, 1.7 (1.3-2.2) for a little trouble, 2.4 (1.7-3.2) for moderate trouble, 1.5 (0.9-2.6) for a lot of trouble, and 0.6 (0.1-2.6) for deaf. Moderate HI (defined by better ear pure-tone average of hearing thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz within the range 35- to 49-dB hearing level) was significantly associated with depression among older women (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.3-11.3), after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, lifestyle characteristics, and selected health conditions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: After accounting for health conditions and other factors, including trouble seeing, self-reported HI and audiometrically determined HI were significantly associated with depression, particularly in women. Health care professionals should be aware of an increased risk for depression among adults with hearing loss.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Audiometry Depression/*epidemiology Female Hearing Loss/*epidemiology Humans Male Middle Aged Nutrition Surveys Prevalence Risk Factors United States/epidemiology"

METHODS We studied 1984 older adults (mean age, 77.4 years) enrolled in the Health ABC Study, a prospective observational study begun in 1997-1998. Our baseline cohort consisted of participants without prevalent cognitive impairment (Modified Mini-Mental State Examination [3MS] score, >/=80) who underwent audiometric testing in year 5. Participants were followed up for 6 years. Hearing was defined at baseline using a pure-tone average of thresholds at 0.5 to 4 kHz in the better-hearing ear. Cognitive testing was performed in years 5, 8, 10, and 11 and consisted of the 3MS (measuring global function) and the Digit Symbol Substitution test (measuring executive function). Incident cognitive impairment was defined as a 3MS score of less than 80 or a decline in 3MS score of more than 5 points from baseline. Mixed-effects regression and Cox proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS In total, 1162 individuals with baseline hearing loss (pure-tone average >25 dB) had annual rates of decline in 3MS and Digit Symbol Substitution test scores that were 41% and 32% greater, respectively, than those among individuals with normal hearing. On the 3MS, the annual score changes were -0.65 (95% CI, -0.73 to -0.56) vs -0.46 (95% CI, -0.55 to -0.36) points per year (P = .004). On the Digit Symbol Substitution test, the annual score changes were -0.83 (95% CI, -0.94 to -0.73) vs -0.63 (95% CI, -0.75 to -0.51) points per year (P = .02). Compared to those with normal hearing, individuals with hearing loss at baseline had a 24% (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05-1.48) increased risk for incident cognitive impairment. Rates of cognitive decline and the risk for incident cognitive impairment were linearly associated with the severity of an individual's baseline hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS Hearing loss is independently associated with accelerated cognitive decline and incident cognitive impairment in community-dwelling older adults. Further studies are needed to investigate what the mechanistic basis of this association is and whether hearing rehabilitative interventions could affect cognitive decline.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Aging/*physiology/psychology Audiometry Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology Female Hearing Loss/*complications/diagnosis Humans Incidence Linear Models Male Neuropsychological Tests Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Risk Factors"
23073950,Effect of high-dose vs standard-dose multivitamin supplementation at the initiation of HAART on HIV disease progression and mortality in Tanzania: a randomized controlled trial.,JAMA,Isanaka S and Mugusi F and Hawkins C and Spiegelman D and Okuma J and Aboud S and Guerino C and Fawzi WW,harvard,"CONTEXT: Large randomized trials have previously shown that high-dose micronutrient supplementation can increase CD4 counts and reduce human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression and mortality among individuals not receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART); however, the safety and efficacy of such supplementation has not been established in the context of HAART. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that high-dose multivitamin supplementation vs standard-dose multivitamin supplementation decreases the risk of HIV disease progression or death and improves immunological, virological, and nutritional parameters in patients with HIV initiating HAART. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of high-dose vs standard-dose multivitamin supplementation for 24 months in 3418 patients with HIV initiating HAART between November 2006 and November 2008 in 7 clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. INTERVENTION The provision of daily oral supplements of vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and vitamin E at high levels or standard levels of the recommended dietary allowance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The composite of HIV disease progression or death from any cause. RESULTS: The study was stopped early in March 2009 because of evidence of increased levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) in patients receiving the high-dose multivitamin supplement. At the time of stopping, 3418 patients were enrolled (median follow-up, 15 months), and there were 2374 HIV disease progression events and 453 observed deaths (2460 total combined events). Compared with standard-dose multivitamin supplementation, high-dose supplementation did not reduce the risk of HIV disease progression or death. The absolute risk of HIV progression or death was 72% in the high-dose group vs 72% in the standard-dose group (risk ratio [RR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.96-1.04). High-dose supplementation had no effect on CD4 count, plasma viral load, body mass index, or hemoglobin level concentration, but increased the risk of ALT elevations (1239 events per 1215 person-years vs 879 events per 1236 person-years; RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11-1.87) vs standard-dose supplementation. CONCLUSION In adults receiving HAART, use of high-dose multivitamin supplements compared with standard-dose multivitamin supplements did not result in a decrease in HIV disease progression or death but may have resulted in an increase in ALT levels.

24782035,"Antidepressant dose, age, and the risk of deliberate self-harm.",JAMA Intern Med,Miller M and Swanson SA and Azrael D and Pate V and Sturmer T,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: A comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized trial data suggests that suicidal behavior is twice as likely when children and young adults are randomized to antidepressants compared with when they are randomized to placebo. Drug-related risk was not elevated for adults older than 24 years. To our knowledge, no study to date has examined whether the risk of suicidal behavior is related to antidepressant dose, and if so, whether risk depends on a patient's age. OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of deliberate self-harm by antidepressant dose, by age group. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a propensity score-matched cohort study using population-based health care utilization data from 162,625 US residents with depression ages 10 to 64 years who initiated antidepressant therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors at modal or at higher than modal doses from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) external cause of injury codes E950.x-E958.x (deliberate self-harm). RESULTS: The rate of deliberate self-harm among children and adults 24 years of age or younger who initiated high-dose therapy was approximately twice as high as among matched patients initiating modal-dose therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 2.2 [95% CI, 1.6-3.0]), corresponding to approximately 1 additional event for every 150 such patients treated with high-dose (instead of modal-dose) therapy. For adults 25 to 64 years of age, the absolute risk of suicidal behavior was far lower and the effective risk difference null (HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.8-1.9]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children and young adults initiating therapy with antidepressants at high-therapeutic (rather than modal-therapeutic) doses seem to be at heightened risk of deliberate self-harm. Considered in light of recent meta-analyses concluding that the efficacy of antidepressant therapy for youth seems to be modest, and separate evidence that antidepressant dose is generally unrelated to therapeutic efficacy, our findings offer clinicians an additional incentive to avoid initiating pharmacotherapy at high-therapeutic doses and to closely monitor patients starting antidepressants, especially youth, for several months.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Child Cohort Studies Female Humans Male Middle Aged Risk Assessment Self-Injurious Behavior/*chemically induced Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Young Adult"
23381719,Dietary and supplemental calcium intake and cardiovascular disease mortality: the National Institutes of Health-AARP diet and health study.,JAMA Intern Med,Xiao Q and Murphy RA and Houston DK and Harris TB and Chow WH and Park Y,nih,"IMPORTANCE: Calcium intake has been promoted because of its proposed benefit on bone health, particularly among the older population. However, concerns have been raised about the potential adverse effect of high calcium intake on cardiovascular health. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether intake of dietary and supplemental calcium is associated with mortality from total cardiovascular disease (CVD), heart disease, and cerebrovascular diseases. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective study from 1995 through 1996 in California, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania and the 2 metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Georgia, and Detroit, Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 388 229 men and women aged 50 to 71 years from the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dietary and supplemental calcium intake was assessed at baseline (1995-1996). Supplemental calcium intake included calcium from multivitamins and individual calcium supplements. Cardiovascular disease deaths were ascertained using the National Death Index. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and dietary variables were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: During a mean of 12 years of follow-up, 7904 and 3874 CVD deaths in men and women, respectively, were identified. Supplements containing calcium were used by 51% of men and 70% of women. In men, supplemental calcium intake was associated with an elevated risk of CVD death (RR>1000 vs 0 mg/d, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.05-1.36), more specifically with heart disease death (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03-1.37) but not significantly with cerebrovascular disease death (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.81-1.61). In women, supplemental calcium intake was not associated with CVD death (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.96-1.18), heart disease death (1.05; 0.93-1.18), or cerebrovascular disease death (1.08; 0.87-1.33). Dietary calcium intake was unrelated to CVD death in either men or women. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our findings suggest that high intake of supplemental calcium is associated with an excess risk of CVD death in men but not in women. Additional studies are needed to investigate the effect of supplemental calcium use beyond bone health.","Aged Calcium/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Calcium, Dietary/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Cardiovascular Diseases/*etiology/*mortality Dietary Supplements/*adverse effects Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Middle Aged National Institutes of Health (U.S.) Nutrition Surveys Questionnaires United States/epidemiology"
24840805,Financial barriers to care among low-income children with asthma: health care reform implications.,JAMA Pediatr,Fung V and Graetz I and Galbraith A and Hamity C and Huang J and Vollmer WM and Hsu J and Wu AC,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes subsidies that reduce patient cost sharing for low-income families. Limited information on the effects of cost sharing among children is available to guide these efforts. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between cost sharing, income, and care seeking and financial stress among children with asthma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A telephone survey in 2012 about experiences during the prior year within an integrated health care delivery system. Respondents included 769 parents of children aged 4 to 11 years with asthma. Of these, 25.9% of children received public subsidies; 21.7% were commercially insured with household incomes at or below 250% of the federal poverty level (FPL) and 18.2% had higher cost-sharing levels for all services (e.g., >/=$75 for emergency department visits). We classified children with asthma based on (1) current receipt of a subsidy (i.e., Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program) or potential eligibility for ACA low-income cost sharing or premium subsidies in 2014 (i.e., income </=250%, 251%-400%, or >400% of the FPL) and (2) cost-sharing levels for prescription drugs, office visits, and emergency department visits. We examined the frequency of changes in care seeking and financial stress due to asthma care costs across these groups using logistic regression, adjusted for patient/family characteristics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Switching to cheaper asthma drugs, using less medication than prescribed, delaying/avoiding any office or emergency department visits, and financial stress (eg, cutting back on necessities) because of the costs of asthma care. RESULTS: After adjustment, parents at or below 250% of the FPL with lower vs higher cost-sharing levels were less likely to delay or avoid taking their children to a physician's office visit (3.8% vs. 31.6%; odds ratio, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.01-0.39]) and the emergency department (1.2% vs. 19.4%; 0.05 [0.01-0.25]) because of cost; higher-income parents and those whose children were receiving public subsidies (eg, Medicaid) were also less likely to forego their children's care than parents at or below 250% of the FPL with higher cost-sharing levels. Overall, 15.6% of parents borrowed money or cut back on necessities to pay for their children's asthma care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cost-related barriers to care among children with asthma were concentrated among low-income families with higher cost-sharing levels. The ACA's low-income subsidies could reduce these barriers for many families, but millions of dependents for whom employer-sponsored family coverage is unaffordable could remain at risk for cost-related problems because of ACA subsidy eligibility rules.","Asthma/*economics California/epidemiology Child Child Health Services/statistics & numerical data/*utilization Child, Preschool Cost Sharing/*statistics & numerical data Female Health Care Reform Health Services Accessibility/statistics & numerical data Humans Income/*statistics & numerical data Insurance, Health/statistics & numerical data Male Medically Uninsured/statistics & numerical data Parents Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data Poverty/statistics & numerical data"
23280227,Association of all-cause mortality with overweight and obesity using standard body mass index categories: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,JAMA,Flegal KM and Kit BK and Orpana H and Graubard BI,cdc,"IMPORTANCE: Estimates of the relative mortality risks associated with normal weight, overweight, and obesity may help to inform decision making in the clinical setting. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of reported hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality for overweight and obesity relative to normal weight in the general population. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and EMBASE electronic databases were searched through September 30, 2012, without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: Articles that reported HRs for all-cause mortality using standard body mass index (BMI) categories from prospective studies of general populations of adults were selected by consensus among multiple reviewers. Studies were excluded that used nonstandard categories or that were limited to adolescents or to those with specific medical conditions or to those undergoing specific procedures. PubMed searches yielded 7034 articles, of which 141 (2.0%) were eligible. An EMBASE search yielded 2 additional articles. After eliminating overlap, 97 studies were retained for analysis, providing a combined sample size of more than 2.88 million individuals and more than 270,000 deaths. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 1 reviewer and then reviewed by 3 independent reviewers. We selected the most complex model available for the full sample and used a variety of sensitivity analyses to address issues of possible overadjustment (adjusted for factors in causal pathway) or underadjustment (not adjusted for at least age, sex, and smoking). RESULTS: Random-effects summary all-cause mortality HRs for overweight (BMI of 25-<30), obesity (BMI of >/=30), grade 1 obesity (BMI of 30-<35), and grades 2 and 3 obesity (BMI of >/=35) were calculated relative to normal weight (BMI of 18.5-<25). The summary HRs were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91-0.96) for overweight, 1.18 (95% CI, 1.12-1.25) for obesity (all grades combined), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.88-1.01) for grade 1 obesity, and 1.29 (95% CI, 1.18-1.41) for grades 2 and 3 obesity. These findings persisted when limited to studies with measured weight and height that were considered to be adequately adjusted. The HRs tended to be higher when weight and height were self-reported rather than measured. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Relative to normal weight, both obesity (all grades) and grades 2 and 3 obesity were associated with significantly higher all-cause mortality. Grade 1 obesity overall was not associated with higher mortality, and overweight was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality. The use of predefined standard BMI groupings can facilitate between-study comparisons.",Adult Aged Body Mass Index Cause of Death Female Humans Male Middle Aged Obesity/classification/*mortality Overweight/*mortality Reference Values
23403684,Intermittent preventive therapy for malaria during pregnancy using 2 vs 3 or more doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and risk of low birth weight in Africa: systematic review and meta-analysis.,JAMA,Kayentao K and Garner P and van Eijk AM and Naidoo I and Roper C and Mulokozi A and MacArthur JR and Luntamo M and Ashorn P and Doumbo OK and ter Kuile FO,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Intermittent preventive therapy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to control malaria during pregnancy is used in 37 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and 31 of those countries use the standard 2-dose regimen. However, 2 doses may not provide protection during the last 4 to 10 weeks of pregnancy, a pivotal period for fetal weight gain. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials to determine whether regimens containing 3 or more doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for intermittent preventive therapy during pregnancy are associated with a higher birth weight or lower risk of low birth weight (LBW) (<2500 g) than standard 2-dose regimens. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: ISI Web of Knowledge, EMBASE, SCOPUS, PubMed, LILACS, the Malaria in Pregnancy Library, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries from their inception to December 2012, without language restriction. Eligible studies included randomized and quasi-randomized trials of intermittent preventive therapy during pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine monotherapy. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were independently abstracted by 2 investigators. Relative risk (RR), mean differences, and 95% CIs were calculated with random-effects models. RESULTS: Of 241 screened studies, 7 trials of 6281 pregnancies were included. The median birth weight in the 2-dose group was 2870 g (range, 2722-3239 g) and on average 56 g higher (95% CI, 29-83 g; I2 = 0%) in the >/=3-dose group. Three or more doses were associated with fewer LBW births (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69-0.94; I 2 = 0%), with a median LBW risk per 1000 women in the 2-dose group (assumed control group risk) of 167 per 1000 vs 134 per 1000 in the >/=3-dose group (absolute risk reduction, 33 per 1000 [95% CI, 10-52]; number needed to treat = 31). The association was consistent across a wide range of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance (0% to 96% dihydropteroate-synthase K540E mutations). There was no evidence of small-study bias. The >/=3-dose group had less placental malaria (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.38-0.68; I 2 = 0%, in 6 trials, 63 vs 32 per 1000; absolute risk reduction, 31 per 1000 [95% CI, 20-39]). In primigravid plus secundigravid women, the risk of moderate to severe maternal anemia was lower in the >/=3-dose group (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.36-0.99; I2 = 20%; in 6 trials, 36 vs 22 per 1000; absolute risk reduction, 14 per 1000 [95% CI, 0.4-23]). There were no differences in rates of serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa, intermittent preventive therapy with 3 or more doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was associated with a higher birth weight and lower risk of LBW than the standard 2-dose regimens. These data provide support for the new WHO recommendations to provide at least 3 doses of intermittent preventive therapy during pregnancy at each scheduled antenatal care visit in the second and third trimester.","Africa/epidemiology Antimalarials/*administration & dosage Drug Administration Schedule Drug Combinations Female Humans *Infant, Low Birth Weight Infant, Newborn Malaria/epidemiology/*prevention & control Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/epidemiology/*prevention & control Pyrimethamine/*administration & dosage Risk Sulfadoxine/*administration & dosage"

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between publicly reported Medicare Advantage plan quality ratings and enrollment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of 2011 Medicare Advantage enrollments among 952,352 first-time enrollees and 322,699 enrollees switching plans. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Association between star ratings and enrollment was modeled using conditional logit regression, controlling for beneficiary and plan characteristics. RESULTS: Among the 952,352 included first-time enrollees, a 1-star higher rating was associated with a 9.5 (95% CI, 9.3-9.6) percentage-point increase in likelihood to enroll. The highest rating available to a beneficiary was associated with a 1.9 (95% CI, 1.8-2.1) percentage-point increase in likelihood to enroll. Among the 322,699 enrollees switching plans, a 1-star higher rating was associated with a 4.4 (95% CI, 4.2-4.7) percentage-point increase in likelihood to enroll. A rating at least as high as a beneficiary's prior plan was associated with a 6.3 (95% CI, 6.0-6.6) percentage-point increase in likelihood to enroll. Star ratings were less strongly associated with enrollment for black, rural, low-income, and the youngest beneficiaries.

This study suggests that highly active ART (HAART) does not appear to impair heart function. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cardiac effects of prolonged exposure to HAART on HIV-infected children. DESIGN: In the National Institutes of Health-funded Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study's Adolescent Master Protocol (AMP), we used linear regression models to compare echocardiographic measures. SETTING: A total of 14 US pediatric HIV clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Perinatally HIV-infected children receiving HAART (n = 325), HIV-exposed but uninfected children (n = 189), and HIV-infected (mostly HAART-unexposed) historical pediatric controls from the National Institutes of Health-funded Pulmonary and Cardiovascular Complications of Vertically Transmitted HIV Infection (P2C2-HIV) Study (n = 70). EXPOSURE Long-term HAART. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Echocardiographic measures of left ventricular (LV) function and structure. RESULTS: The 325 AMP HIV-infected children had lower viral loads, higher CD4 counts, and longer durations of ART than did the 70 HIV-infected children from the P2C2-HIV Study (all P < .001). The z scores for LV fractional shortening (a measure of cardiac function) were significantly lower among HIV-infected children from the P2C2-HIV Study than among the AMP HIV-infected group or the 189 AMP HIV-exposed but uninfected controls (P < .05). For HIV-infected children, a lower nadir CD4 percentage and a higher current viral load were associated with significantly lower cardiac function (LV contractility and LV fractional shortening z scores; all P = .001) and an increased LV end-systolic dimension z score (all P < .03). In an interaction analysis by HIV-infected cohort, the HIV-infected children from the P2C2-HIV Study with a longer ART exposure or a lower nadir CD4 percentage had lower mean LV fractional shortening z scores, whereas the mean z scores were relatively constant among AMP HIV-infected children (P < .05 for all interactions).

24108317,Relationship between asking an older adult about falls and surgical outcomes.,JAMA Surg,Jones TS and Dunn CL and Wu DS and Cleveland JC Jr and Kile D and Robinson TN,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: More than one-third of all US inpatient operations are performed on patients aged 65 years and older. Existing preoperative risk assessment strategies are not adequate to meet the needs of the aging population. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship of a history of falls (a geriatric syndrome) to postoperative outcomes in older adults undergoing major elective operations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, cohort study was conducted at a referral medical center. Persons aged 65 years and older undergoing elective colorectal and cardiac operations were enrolled. The predictor variable was having fallen in the 6 months prior to the operation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Postoperative outcomes measured included 30-day complications, the need for discharge institutionalization, and 30-day readmission. RESULTS: There were 235 subjects with a mean (SD) age of 74 (6) years. Preoperative falls occurred in 33%. One or more postoperative complications occurred more frequently in the group with prior falls compared with the nonfallers following both colorectal (59% vs 25%; P = .004) and cardiac (39% vs 15%; P = .002) operations. These findings were independent of advancing chronologic age. The need for discharge to an institutional care facility occurred more frequently in the group that had fallen in comparison with the nonfallers in both the colorectal (52% vs 6%; P < .001) and cardiac (62% vs 32%; P = .001) groups. Similarly, 30-day readmission was higher in the group with prior falls following both colorectal (P = .04) and cardiac (P = .02) operations. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A history of 1 or more falls in the 6 months prior to an operation forecasts increased postoperative complications, the need for discharge institutionalization, and 30-day readmission across surgical specialties. Using a history of prior falls in preoperative risk assessment for an older adult represents a shift from current preoperative assessment strategies.","Academic Medical Centers Accidental Falls/*statistics & numerical data Aged Aged, 80 and over Cardiac Surgical Procedures/adverse effects/methods Cohort Studies Colorectal Surgery/adverse effects/methods Female Geriatric Assessment/*methods Hospital Mortality Humans Male Medical History Taking/methods Postoperative Complications/*mortality/physiopathology Predictive Value of Tests Preoperative Care/methods Prognosis Prospective Studies Surgical Procedures, Elective/*adverse effects/methods/*mortality Survival Rate Treatment Outcome"

OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and importance of time elapsed between stroke and surgery in the risk of perioperative cardiovascular events and mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Danish nationwide cohort study (2005-2011) including all patients aged 20 years or older undergoing elective noncardiac surgeries (n=481,183 surgeries). EXPOSURES: Time elapsed between stroke and surgery in categories and as a continuous measure. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; including ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality) and all-cause mortality up to 30 days after surgery. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Crude incidence rates of MACE among patients with (n = 7137) and without (n = 474,046) prior stroke were 54.4 (95% CI, 49.1-59.9) vs 4.1 (95% CI, 3.9-4.2) per 1000 patients. Compared with patients without stroke, ORs for MACE were 14.23 (95% CI, 11.61-17.45) for stroke less than 3 months prior to surgery, 4.85 (95% CI, 3.32-7.08) for stroke 3 to less than 6 months prior, 3.04 (95% CI, 2.13-4.34) for stroke 6 to less than 12 months prior, and 2.47 (95% CI, 2.07-2.95) for stroke 12 months or more prior. MACE risks were at least as high for low-risk (OR, 9.96; 95% CI, 5.49-18.07 for stroke <3 months) and intermediate-risk (OR, 17.12; 95% CI, 13.68-21.42 for stroke <3 months) surgery compared with high-risk surgery (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 0.98-9.01 for stroke <3 months) (P = .003 for interaction). Similar patterns were found for 30-day mortality: ORs were 3.07 (95% CI, 2.30-4.09) for stroke less than 3 months prior, 1.97 (95% CI, 1.22-3.19) for stroke 3 to less than 6 months prior, 1.45 (95% CI, 0.95-2.20) for stroke 6 to less than 12 months prior, and 1.46 (95% CI, 1.21-1.77) for stroke 12 months or more prior to surgery compared with patients without stroke. Cubic regression splines performed on the stroke subgroup supported that risk leveled off after 9 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A history of stroke was associated with adverse outcomes following surgery, in particular if time between stroke and surgery was less than 9 months. After 9 months, the associated risk appeared stable yet still increased compared with patients with no stroke. The time dependency of risk may warrant attention in future guidelines.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Brain Ischemia/complications/*mortality Cardiovascular Diseases/*mortality Cohort Studies Denmark/epidemiology Female Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Postoperative Complications/mortality Risk Stroke Surgical Procedures, Elective/*mortality Time Factors"

Across 3 decades of age, the mean (95% CI) AMI events per 1000 person-years was consistently and significantly higher for HIV-positive compared with uninfected veterans: for those aged 40 to 49 years, 2.0 (1.6-2.4) vs 1.5 (1.3-1.7); for those aged 50 to 59 years, 3.9 (3.3-4.5) vs 2.2 (1.9-2.5); and for those aged 60 to 69 years, 5.0 (3.8-6.7) vs 3.3 (2.6-4.2) (P < .05 for all). After adjusting for Framingham risk factors, comorbidities, and substance use, HIV-positive veterans had an increased risk of incident AMI compared with uninfected veterans (hazard ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.27-1.72). An excess risk remained among those achieving an HIV-1 RNA level less than 500 copies/mL compared with uninfected veterans in time-updated analyses (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.17-1.66).

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of developing SSHL in patients with HIV. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cohort population-based study using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 8760 patients with HIV and 43,800 control subjects without HIV were selected from insurance claims between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The incidence of SSHL was assessed and determined at the end of 2009. RESULTS: Among patients aged 18 to 35 years, the incidence of SSHL was 2.17-fold higher in the HIV group than in the control group (4.32 vs 1.99 per 10,000 person-years, P = .03). The risk of developing SSHL increased with HIV infection; an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.169 (95% CI, 1.071-4.391) was calculated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Among male patients, the incidence of developing SSHL was 2.23-fold higher (95% CI, 1.06-4.69) in the HIV group than in the control group. The incidence of SSHL did not differ significantly between the HIV group and the control group for patients 36 years or older. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Human immunodeficiency virus infection is significantly associated with an increased risk of developing SSHL in patients aged 18 to 35 years, particularly among male patients.","Adolescent Adult Chi-Square Distribution Female HIV Infections/*complications/epidemiology Hearing Loss, Sensorineural/epidemiology/*etiology Hearing Loss, Sudden/epidemiology/*etiology Humans Incidence Male Propensity Score Proportional Hazards Models Retrospective Studies Risk Survival Rate Taiwan/epidemiology"
24687044,Optimization of human immunodeficiency virus treatment during incarceration: viral suppression at the prison gate.,JAMA Intern Med,Meyer JP and Cepeda J and Wu J and Trestman RL and Altice FL and Springer SA,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) management in correctional settings is logistically feasible, but HIV-related outcomes before release have not been recently systematically examined. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate HIV treatment outcomes throughout incarceration, including jail and prison. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of longitudinally linked demographic, pharmacy, and laboratory data on 882 prisoners within the Connecticut Department of Correction (2005-2012) with confirmed HIV infection, who were continually incarcerated 90 days or more, had at least 2 HIV-1 RNA and CD4 lymphocyte measurements, and were prescribed antiretroviral therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Three electronic databases (correctional, laboratory, and pharmacy) were integrated to assess HIV viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA levels, <400 copies/mL) on intake and release. Secondary outcomes were mean change in log-transformed HIV-1 RNA levels and mean change in CD4 lymphocyte count during incarceration. Demographic characteristics, prescribed pharmacotherapies, receipt of directly observed therapy, and duration of incarceration were analyzed as possible explanatory variables for HIV viral suppression in logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among 882 HIV-infected prisoners with 1185 incarceration periods, mean HIV-1 RNA level decreased by 1.1 log10 and CD4 lymphocyte count increased by 98 cells/microL over time, with a higher proportion achieving viral suppression by release compared with entry (70.0% vs 29.8%; P < .001); 36.9% of antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens were changed during incarceration. After adjusting for baseline HIV-1 RNA level, prerelease viral suppression correlated with female sex (adjusted odds ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.26-2.59) and psychiatric disorder severity below the sample median (adjusted odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.12-1.99), but not race/ethnicity, incarceration duration, ART regimen or dosing strategy, or directly observed therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Though just one-third of HIV-infected prisoners receiving ART entered correctional facilities with viral suppression, HIV treatment was optimized during incarceration, resulting in the majority achieving viral suppression by release. Treatment for HIV within prison is facilitated by a highly structured environment and, when combined with simple well-tolerated ART regimens, can result in viral suppression during incarceration. In the absence of important and effective community-based resources, incarceration can be an opportunity of last resort to initiate continuous ART for individual health and, following the ""treatment as prevention"" paradigm, potentially reduce the likelihood of HIV transmission to others after release if continuity of HIV care is sustained.",Anti-Retroviral Agents/*therapeutic use CD4 Lymphocyte Count Cohort Studies Connecticut Female HIV Infections/*drug therapy/virology HIV-1/*isolation & purification Humans Male Prisoners/*statistics & numerical data Prisons/*statistics & numerical data Regression Analysis Retrospective Studies Treatment Outcome Viral Load/drug effects/*trends
24549550,Effect of a home-based exercise program on functional recovery following rehabilitation after hip fracture: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Latham NK and Harris BA and Bean JF and Heeren T and Goodyear C and Zawacki S and Heislein DM and Mustafa J and Pardasaney P and Giorgetti M and Holt N and Goehring L and Jette AM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: For many older people, long-term functional limitations persist after a hip fracture. The efficacy of a home exercise program with minimal supervision after formal hip fracture rehabilitation ends has not been established. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a home exercise program with minimal contact with a physical therapist improved function after formal hip fracture rehabilitation ended. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial conducted from September 2008 to October 2012 in the homes of 232 functionally limited older adults who had completed traditional rehabilitation after a hip fracture. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group (n = 120) received functionally oriented exercises (such as standing from a chair, climbing a step) taught by a physical therapist and performed independently by the participants in their homes for 6 months. The attention control group (n = 112) received in-home and telephone-based cardiovascular nutrition education. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Physical function assessed at baseline, 6 months (ie, at completion of the intervention), and 9 months by blinded assessors. The primary outcome was change in function at 6 months measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; range 0-12, higher score indicates better function) and the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) mobility and daily activity (range, 23-85 and 9-101, higher score indicates better function). RESULTS: Among the 232 randomized patients, 195 were followed up at 6 months and included in the primary analysis. The intervention group (n=100) showed significant improvement relative to the control group (n=95) in functional mobility (mean SPPB scores for intervention group: 6.2 [SD, 2.7] at baseline, 7.2 [SD, 3] at 6 months; control group: 6.0 [SD, 2.8] at baseline, 6.2 [SD, 3] at 6 months; and between-group differences: 0.8 [95% CI, 0.4 to 1.2], P < .001; mean AM-PAC mobility scores for intervention group: 56.2 [SD, 7.3] at baseline, 58.1 [SD, 7.9] at 6 months; control group: 56 [SD, 7.1] at baseline, 56.6 [SD, 8.1] at 6 months; and between-group difference, 1.3 [95% CI, 0.2 to 2.4], P = .03; and mean AM-PAC daily activity scores for intervention group: 57.4 [SD, 13.7] at baseline, 61.3 [SD, 15.7] at 6 months; control group: 58.2 [SD, 15.2] at baseline, 58.6 [SD, 15.3] at 6 months; and between-group difference, 3.5 [95% CI, 0.9 to 6.0], P = .03). In multiple imputation analyses, between-group differences remained significant for SPPB and AM-PAC daily activity, but not for mobility. Significant between-group differences persisted at 9 months for all functional measures with and without imputation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients who had completed standard rehabilitation after hip fracture, the use of a home-based functionally oriented exercise program resulted in modest improvement in physical function at 6 months after randomization. The clinical importance of these findings remains to be determined.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a home-based walking exercise program that uses a group-mediated cognitive behavioral intervention, incorporating both group support and self-regulatory skills, can improve functional performance compared with a health education control group in patients with PAD with and without intermittent claudication. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized controlled clinical trial of 194 patients with PAD, including 72.2% without classic symptoms of intermittent claudication, performed in Chicago, Illinois between July 22, 2008, and December 14, 2012. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 parallel groups: a home-based group-mediated cognitive behavioral walking intervention or an attention control condition. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month change in 6-minute walk performance. Secondary outcomes included 6-month change in treadmill walking, physical activity, the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), and Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores from the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey. RESULTS: Participants randomized to the intervention group significantly increased their 6-minute walk distance ([reported in meters] 357.4 to 399.8 vs 353.3 to 342.2 for those in the control group; mean difference, 53.5 [95% CI, 33.2 to 73.8]; P < .001), maximal treadmill walking time (intervention, 7.91 to 9.44 minutes vs control, 7.56 to 8.09; mean difference, 1.01 minutes [95% CI, 0.07 to 1.95]; P = .04), accelerometer-measured physical activity over 7 days (intervention, 778.0 to 866.1 vs control, 671.6 to 645.0; mean difference, 114.7 activity units [95% CI, 12.82 to 216.5]; P = .03), WIQ distance score (intervention, 35.3 to 47.4 vs control, 33.3 to 34.4; mean difference, 11.1 [95% CI, 3.9 to 18.1]; P = .003), and WIQ speed score (intervention, 36.1 to 47.7 vs control, 35.3-36.6; mean difference, 10.4 [95% CI, 3.4 to 17.4]; P = .004). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: A home-based walking exercise program significantly improved walking endurance, physical activity, and patient-perceived walking endurance and speed in PAD participants with and without classic claudication symptoms. These findings have implications for the large number of patients with PAD who are unable or unwilling to participate in supervised exercise programs.

25003802,Effect of Home Visiting by Nurses on Maternal and Child Mortality: Results of a 2-Decade Follow-up of a Randomized Clinical Trial.,JAMA Pediatr,Olds DL and Kitzman H and Knudtson MD and Anson E and Smith JA and Cole R,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Mothers and children living in adverse contexts are at risk of premature death. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of prenatal and infant/toddler nurse home visiting on maternal and child mortality during a 2-decade period (1990-2011). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial was designed originally to assess the home visiting program's effect on pregnancy outcomes and maternal and child health through child age 2 years. The study was conducted in a public system of obstetric and pediatric care in Memphis, Tennessee. Participants included primarily African American women and their first live-born children living in highly disadvantaged urban neighborhoods, who were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: treatment 1 (transportation for prenatal care [n = 166]), treatment 2 (transportation plus developmental screening for infants and toddlers [n = 514]), treatment 3 (transportation plus prenatal/postpartum home visiting [n = 230]), and treatment 4 (transportation, screening, and prenatal, postpartum, and infant/toddler home visiting [n = 228]). Treatments 1 and 3 were included originally to increase statistical power for testing pregnancy outcomes. For determining mortality, background information was available for all 1138 mothers assigned to all 4 treatments and all but 2 live-born children in treatments 2 and 4 (n = 704). Inclusion of children in treatments 1 and 3 was not possible because background information was missing on too many children. INTERVENTIONS: Nurses sought to improve the outcomes of pregnancy, children's health and development, and mothers' health and life-course with home visits beginning during pregnancy and continuing through child age 2 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause mortality in mothers and preventable-cause mortality in children (sudden infant death syndrome, unintentional injury, and homicide) derived from the National Death Index. RESULTS: The mean (SE) 21-year maternal all-cause mortality rate was 3.7% (0.74%) in the combined control group (treatments 1 and 2), 0.4% (0.43%) in treatment 3, and 2.2% (0.97%) in treatment 4. The survival contrast of treatments 1 and 2 combined with treatment 3 was significant (P = .007); the contrast of treatments 1 and 2 combined with treatment 4 was not significant (P = .19), and the contrast of treatments 1 and 2 combined with treatments 3 and 4 combined was significant (post hoc P = .008). At child age 20 years, the preventable-cause child mortality rate was 1.6% (0.57%) in treatment 2 and 0.0% (SE not calculable) in treatment 4; the survival contrast was significant (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Prenatal and infant/toddler home visitation by nurses is a promising means of reducing all-cause mortality among mothers and preventable-cause mortality in their first-born children living in highly disadvantaged settings.

24402245,Explaining racial disparities in outcomes after cardiac surgery: the role of hospital quality.,JAMA Surg,Rangrass G and Ghaferi AA and Dimick JB,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Racial disparities in mortality rates after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are well established. We have yet to fully understand how care at high-mortality, low-quality hospitals contributes to racial disparities in surgical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of hospital quality on racial disparities in mortality rates after CABG surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The national Medicare database (2007-2008) was used to identify 173,925 patients undergoing CABG surgery in US hospitals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Our primary measure of quality was the risk-adjusted mortality rate for each hospital. Logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between race and mortality rates, accounting for patient characteristics, socioeconomic status, and hospital quality. RESULTS: Nonwhite patients had 33% higher risk-adjusted mortality rates after CABG surgery than white patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95% CI, 1.23-1.45). In hospitals treating the highest proportion of nonwhite patients (>17.7%), the mortality was 4.8% in nonwhite and 3.8% in white patients. When assessed independently, differences in hospital quality explained 35% of the observed disparity in mortality rates (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.12-1.34). We were able to explain 53% of the observed disparity after adjusting for differences in socioeconomic status and hospital quality. However, even after these factors were taken into account, nonwhite patients had a 16% higher mortality (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.27). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hospital quality contributes significantly to racial disparities in outcomes after CABG surgery. However, a significant fraction of this racial disparity remains unexplained. Efforts to decrease racial disparities in health care should focus on underperforming centers of care treating disproportionately high numbers of nonwhite patients.","African Americans/statistics & numerical data Aged Continental Population Groups/*statistics & numerical data Coronary Artery Bypass/*mortality Coronary Disease/ethnology/surgery European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Female *Health Status Disparities Hispanic Americans/statistics & numerical data Hospital Mortality/*ethnology Hospitals/*standards Humans Logistic Models Male Medicare/statistics & numerical data Odds Ratio *Outcome Assessment (Health Care) *Quality Indicators, Health Care/statistics & numerical data Quality of Health Care Social Class United States/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVE: To examine readmission diagnoses and timing among Medicare beneficiaries readmitted within 30 days after hospitalization for HF, acute MI, or pneumonia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We analyzed 2007-2009 Medicare fee-for-service claims data to identify patterns of 30-day readmission by patient demographic characteristics and time after hospitalization for HF, acute MI, or pneumonia. Readmission diagnoses were categorized using an aggregated version of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Condition Categories. Readmission timing was determined by day after discharge. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We examined the percentage of 30-day readmissions occurring on each day (0-30) after discharge; the most common readmission diagnoses occurring during cumulative periods (days 0-3, 0-7, 0-15, and 0-30) and consecutive periods (days 0-3, 4-7, 8-15, and 16-30) after hospitalization; median time to readmission for common readmission diagnoses; and the relationship between patient demographic characteristics and readmission diagnoses and timing. RESULTS: From 2007 through 2009, we identified 329,308 30-day readmissions after 1,330,157 HF hospitalizations (24.8% readmitted), 108,992 30-day readmissions after 548,834 acute MI hospitalizations (19.9% readmitted), and 214,239 30-day readmissions after 1,168,624 pneumonia hospitalizations (18.3% readmitted). The proportion of patients readmitted for the same condition was 35.2% after the index HF hospitalization, 10.0% after the index acute MI hospitalization, and 22.4% after the index pneumonia hospitalization. Of all readmissions within 30 days of hospitalization, the majority occurred within 15 days of hospitalization: 61.0%, HF cohort; 67.6%, acute MI cohort; and 62.6%, pneumonia cohort. The diverse spectrum of readmission diagnoses was largely similar in both cumulative and consecutive periods after discharge. Median time to 30-day readmission was 12 days for patients initially hospitalized for HF, 10 days for patients initially hospitalized for acute MI, and 12 days for patients initially hospitalized for pneumonia and was comparable across common readmission diagnoses. Neither readmission diagnoses nor timing substantively varied by age, sex, or race. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries hospitalized for HF, acute MI, or pneumonia, 30-day readmissions were frequent throughout the month after hospitalization and resulted from a similar spectrum of readmission diagnoses regardless of age, sex, race, or time after discharge.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies Fee-for-Service Plans/statistics & numerical data Female Heart Failure/*diagnosis/therapy Humans Insurance Claim Review International Classification of Diseases/*statistics & numerical data Male Medicare/statistics & numerical data Myocardial Infarction/*diagnosis/therapy Outcome Assessment (Health Care) Patient Readmission/*statistics & numerical data Pneumonia/*diagnosis/therapy Retrospective Studies Time Factors United States"

Research is needed to determine the rates and factors related to readmission in this patient population. OBJECTIVE: To determine 30-day readmission rates and factors related to readmission for patients receiving postacute inpatient rehabilitation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective cohort study of records for 736,536 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries (mean age, 78.0 [SD, 7.3] years) discharged from 1365 inpatient rehabilitation facilities to the community in 2006 through 2011. Sixty-three percent of patients were women, and 85.1% were non-Hispanic white. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Thirty-day readmission rates for the 6 largest diagnostic impairment categories receiving inpatient rehabilitation. These included stroke, lower extremity fracture, lower extremity joint replacement, debility, neurologic disorders, and brain dysfunction. RESULTS: Mean rehabilitation length of stay was 12.4 (SD, 5.3) days. The overall 30-day readmission rate was 11.8% (95% CI, 11.7%-11.8%). Rates ranged from 5.8% (95% CI, 5.8%-5.9%) for patients with lower extremity joint replacement to 18.8% (95% CI, 18.8%-18.9%). for patients with debility.

Higher motor and cognitive functional status were associated with lower hospital readmission rates across the 6 impairment categories. Adjusted readmission rates by state ranged from 9.2% to 13.6%. Approximately 50% of patients rehospitalized within the 30-day period were readmitted within 11 days of discharge. Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related Group codes for heart failure, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, septicemia, nutritional and metabolic disorders, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, and digestive disorders were common reasons for readmission. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among postacute rehabilitation facilities providing services to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, 30-day readmission rates ranged from 5.8% to 18.8% for selected impairment groups.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of a home-based intervention to improve household routines known to be associated with childhood obesity among a sample of low-income, racial/ethnic minority families with young children. DESIGN: Randomized trial. SETTING: The intervention was delivered in the families' homes. PARTICIPANTS: The study involved 121 families with children aged 2 to 5 years who had a television (TV) in the room where he or she slept; 111 (92%) had 6-month outcome data (55 intervention and 56 control). The mean (SD) age of the children was 4.0 (1.1) years; 45% were overweight/obese. Fifty-two percent of the children were Hispanic, 34% were black, and 14% were white/other. Nearly 60% of the families had household incomes of $20,000 or less. INTERVENTIONS: The 6-month intervention promoted 4 household routines, family meals, adequate sleep, limiting TV time, and removing the TV from the child's bedroom, using (1) motivational coaching at home and by phone, (2) mailed educational materials, and (3) text messages. Control subjects were mailed materials focused on child development. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in parent report of frequency of family meals (times/wk), child sleep duration (hours/d), child weekday and weekend day TV viewing (hours/d), and the presence of a TV in the room where the child slept from baseline to 6 months. A secondary outcome was change in age- and sex-adjusted body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, intervention participants had increased sleep duration (0.75 hours/d; 95% CI, 0.06 to 1.44; P = .03), greater decreases in TV viewing on weekend days (-1.06 hours/d; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.15; P = .02), and decreased body mass index (-0.40; 95% CI, -0.79 to 0.00; P = .05). No significant intervention effect was found for the presence of a TV in the room where the child slept or family meal frequency. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results suggest that promoting household routines, particularly increasing sleep duration and reducing TV viewing, may be an effective approach to reduce body mass index among low-income, racial/ethnic minority children. Longer-term studies are needed to determine maintenance of behavior change.

Early exposure to complex dietary proteins may increase the risk of beta-cell autoimmunity in children at genetic risk for type 1 diabetes. Extensively hydrolyzed formulas do not contain intact proteins. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that weaning to an extensively hydrolyzed formula decreases the cumulative incidence of diabetes-associated autoantibodies in young children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A double-blind randomized clinical trial of 2159 infants with HLA-conferred disease susceptibility and a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes recruited from May 2002 to January 2007 in 78 study centers in 15 countries; 1078 were randomized to be weaned to the extensively hydrolyzed casein formula and 1081 were randomized to be weaned to a conventional cows' milk-based formula. The participants were observed to April 16, 2013. INTERVENTIONS: The participants received either a casein hydrolysate or a conventional cows' milk formula supplemented with 20% of the casein hydrolysate. MAIN OUTCOMES: AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was positivity for at least 2 diabetes-associated autoantibodies out of 4 analyzed. Autoantibodies to insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and the insulinoma-associated-2 (IA-2) molecule were analyzed using radiobinding assays and islet cell antibodies with immunofluorescence during a median observation period of 7.0 years (mean, 6.3 years). RESULTS: The absolute risk of positivity for 2 or more islet autoantibodies was 13.4% among those randomized to the casein hydrolysate formula (n = 139) vs 11.4% among those randomized to the conventional formula (n = 117). The unadjusted hazard ratio for positivity for 2 or more autoantibodies among those randomized to be weaned to the casein hydrolysate was 1.21 (95% CI, 0.94-1.54), compared with those randomized to the conventional formula, while the hazard ratio adjusted for HLA risk, duration of breastfeeding, vitamin D use, study formula duration and consumption, and region was 1.23 (95% CI, 0.96-1.58). There were no clinically significant differences in the rate of reported adverse events between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among infants at risk for type 1 diabetes, the use of a hydrolyzed formula, when compared with a conventional formula, did not reduce the incidence of diabetes-associated autoantibodies after 7 years. These findings do not support a benefit from hydrolyzed formula.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of self-monitoring with self-titration of antihypertensive medication compared with usual care on systolic blood pressure among patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A primary care, unblinded, randomized clinical trial involving 552 patients who were aged at least 35 years with a history of stroke, coronary heart disease, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease and with baseline blood pressure of at least 130/80 mm Hg being treated at 59 UK primary care practices was conducted between March 2011 and January 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Self-monitoring of blood pressure combined with an individualized self-titration algorithm. During the study period, the office visit blood pressure measurement target was 130/80 mm Hg and the home measurement target was 120/75 mm Hg. Control patients received usual care consisting of seeing their health care clinician for routine blood pressure measurement and adjustment of medication if necessary. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the difference in systolic blood pressure between intervention and control groups at the 12-month office visit. RESULTS: Primary outcome data were available from 450 patients (81%). The mean baseline blood pressure was 143.1/80.5 mm Hg in the intervention group and 143.6/79.5 mm Hg in the control group. After 12 months, the mean blood pressure had decreased to 128.2/73.8 mm Hg in the intervention group and to 137.8/76.3 mm Hg in the control group, a difference of 9.2 mm Hg (95% CI, 5.7-12.7) in systolic and 3.4 mm Hg (95% CI, 1.8-5.0) in diastolic blood pressure following correction for baseline blood pressure. Multiple imputation for missing values gave similar results: the mean baseline was 143.5/80.2 mm Hg in the intervention group vs 144.2/79.9 mm Hg in the control group, and at 12 months, the mean was 128.6/73.6 mm Hg in the intervention group vs 138.2/76.4 mm Hg in the control group, with a difference of 8.8 mm Hg (95% CI, 4.9-12.7) for systolic and 3.1 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.7-5.5) for diastolic blood pressure between groups. These results were comparable in all subgroups, without excessive adverse events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with hypertension at high risk of cardiovascular disease, self-monitoring with self-titration of antihypertensive medication compared with usual care resulted in lower systolic blood pressure at 12 months.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism with MCI in a large population-based cohort. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, cross-sectional, population-based cohort study was conducted in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Participants were aged 70 to 89 years on October 1, 2004, and were without documented prevalent dementia. A total of 2050 participants were evaluated and underwent in-person interview, neurologic evaluation, and neuropsychological testing to assess performance in memory, attention/executive function, and visuospatial and language domains. Participants were categorized by consensus as being cognitively normal, having MCI, or having dementia according to published criteria. Clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism were ascertained from a medical records linkage system. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association of clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism with MCI. RESULTS: Among 1904 eligible participants, the frequency of MCI was 16% in 1450 individuals with normal thyroid function, 17% in 313 persons with clinical hypothyroidism, and 18% in 141 individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism. After adjusting for covariates (age, educational level, sex, apolipoprotein E epsilon4, depression, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, body mass index, and coronary artery disease) we found no significant association between clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism and MCI (odds ratio [OR], 0.99 [95% CI, 0.66-1.48] and 0.88 [0.38-2.03], respectively). No effect of sex interaction was seen on these effects. In stratified analysis, the odds of MCI with clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism among men was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.57-1.82) and 1.29 (0.68-2.44) and, among women, was 1.04 (0.66-1.66) and 0.86 (0.37-2.02), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this population-based cohort of elderly people, neither clinical nor subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with MCI. Our findings need to be validated in a separate setting using the published criteria for MCI and confirmed in a longitudinal study.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies Cross-Sectional Studies Female Humans Hypothyroidism/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology Male Mild Cognitive Impairment/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology Population Surveillance/*methods Registries Risk Factors"

Objectives: To identify independent prognostic factors for the development of renal scarring and to combine these factors in prediction models that could be useful in clinical practice. Data Sources: MEDLINE and EMBASE. Study Selection: We included patients aged 0 to 18 years with a first urinary tract infection who underwent follow-up renal scanning with technetium Tc 99m succimer at least 5 months later. Data Extraction and Synthesis: We pooled individual patient data from 9 cohort studies. Main Outcomes and Measures: We examined the association between predictor variables assessed at the time of the first urinary tract infection and the development of renal scarring. Renal scarring was defined by the presence of photopenia on the renal scan. We assessed the following 3 models: clinical (demographic information, fever, and etiologic organism) and ultrasonographic findings (model 1); model 1 plus serum levels of inflammatory markers (model 2); and model 2 plus voiding cystourethrogram findings (model 3). Results: Of the 1280 included participants, 199 (15.5%) had renal scarring. A temperature of at least 39 degrees C, an etiologic organism other than Escherichia coli, an abnormal ultrasonographic finding, polymorphonuclear cell count of greater than 60%, C-reactive protein level of greater than 40 mg/L, and presence of vesicoureteral reflux were all associated with the development of renal scars (P </= .01 for all). Although the presence of grade IV or V vesicoureteral reflux was the strongest predictor of renal scarring, this degree of reflux was present in only 4.1% of patients. The overall predictive ability of model 1 with 3 variables (temperature, ultrasonographic findings, and etiologic organism) was only 3% to 5% less than the predictive ability of models requiring a blood draw and/or a voiding cystourethrogram. Patients with a model 1 score of 2 or more (21.7% of the sample) represent a particularly high-risk group in whom the risk for renal scarring was 30.7%. At this cutoff, model 1 identified 44.9% of patients with eventual renal scarring. Conclusions and Relevance: Children and adolescents with an abnormal renal ultrasonographic finding or with a combination of high fever (>/=39 degrees C) and an etiologic organism other than E coli are at high risk for the development of renal scarring.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: To determine how methamphetamine-dependent and control participants differ in brain activation during a risky decision-making task, resting-state functional connectivity within mesolimbic and executive control circuits, and the relationships between these measures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A case-control, functional magnetic resonance imaging study of methamphetamine-dependent and healthy comparison participants at rest and when performing the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, which involves the choice to pump a balloon or to cash out in the context of uncertain risk. Conducted at a clinical research center at an academic institution, this study involved 25 methamphetamine-dependent and 27 control participants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Parametric modulation of activation in the striatum and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC; ie, the degree to which activation changed as a linear function of risk and potential reward), both indexed by pump number, and resting-state functional connectivity, measured in the whole brain with seeds in the midbrain and rDLPFC. Relationships between these outcomes were also tested. RESULTS: Parametric modulation of cortical and striatal activation by pump number during risk taking differed with group. It was stronger in the ventral striatum but weaker in the rDLPFC in methamphetamine-dependent participants than control individuals. Methamphetamine-dependent participants also exhibited greater resting-state functional connectivity of the midbrain with the putamen, amygdala, and hippocampus (P < .05, whole brain, cluster corrected). This connectivity was negatively related to modulation of rDLPFC activation by risk level during risky decision making. In control participants, parametric modulation of rDLPFC activation by risk during decision making was positively related to resting-state functional connectivity of the rDLPFC with the striatum. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Maladaptive decision making by methamphetamine users may reflect circuit-level dysfunction, underlying deficits in task-based activation. Heightened resting-state connectivity within the mesocorticolimbic system, coupled with reduced prefrontal cortical connectivity, may create a bias toward reward-driven behavior over cognitive control in methamphetamine users. Interventions to improve this balance may enhance treatments for stimulant dependence and other disorders that involve maladaptive decision making.",Adult Amphetamine-Related Disorders/*physiopathology/psychology Amygdala/drug effects/physiopathology Basal Ganglia/drug effects/physiopathology Case-Control Studies Connectome/instrumentation/*methods Decision Making/*drug effects/physiology Female Hippocampus/drug effects/physiopathology Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Methamphetamine/*adverse effects Prefrontal Cortex/drug effects/*physiopathology Risk-Taking
23280226,Effects of fructose vs glucose on regional cerebral blood flow in brain regions involved with appetite and reward pathways.,JAMA,Page KA and Chan O and Arora J and Belfort-Deaguiar R and Dzuira J and Roehmholdt B and Cline GW and Naik S and Sinha R and Constable RT and Sherwin RS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Increases in fructose consumption have paralleled the increasing prevalence of obesity, and high-fructose diets are thought to promote weight gain and insulin resistance. Fructose ingestion produces smaller increases in circulating satiety hormones compared with glucose ingestion, and central administration of fructose provokes feeding in rodents, whereas centrally administered glucose promotes satiety. OBJECTIVE: To study neurophysiological factors that might underlie associations between fructose consumption and weight gain. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty healthy adult volunteers underwent 2 magnetic resonance imaging sessions at Yale University in conjunction with fructose or glucose drink ingestion in a blinded, random-order, crossover design. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative changes in hypothalamic regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) after glucose or fructose ingestion. Secondary outcomes included whole-brain analyses to explore regional CBF changes, functional connectivity analysis to investigate correlations between the hypothalamus and other brain region responses, and hormone responses to fructose and glucose ingestion. RESULTS: There was a significantly greater reduction in hypothalamic CBF after glucose vs fructose ingestion (-5.45 vs 2.84 mL/g per minute, respectively; mean difference, 8.3 mL/g per minute [95% CI of mean difference, 1.87-14.70]; P = .01). Glucose ingestion (compared with baseline) increased functional connectivity between the hypothalamus and the thalamus and striatum. Fructose increased connectivity between the hypothalamus and thalamus but not the striatum. Regional CBF within the hypothalamus, thalamus, insula, anterior cingulate, and striatum (appetite and reward regions) was reduced after glucose ingestion compared with baseline (P < .05 significance threshold, family-wise error [FWE] whole-brain corrected). In contrast, fructose reduced regional CBF in the thalamus, hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex, fusiform, and visual cortex (P < .05 significance threshold, FWE whole-brain corrected). In whole-brain voxel-level analyses, there were no significant differences between direct comparisons of fructose vs glucose sessions following correction for multiple comparisons. Fructose vs glucose ingestion resulted in lower peak levels of serum glucose (mean difference, 41.0 mg/dL [95% CI, 27.7-54.5]; P < .001), insulin (mean difference, 49.6 muU/mL [95% CI, 38.2-61.1]; P < .001), and glucagon-like polypeptide 1 (mean difference, 2.1 pmol/L [95% CI, 0.9-3.2]; P = .01). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In a series of exploratory analyses, consumption of fructose compared with glucose resulted in a distinct pattern of regional CBF and a smaller increase in systemic glucose, insulin, and glucagon-like polypeptide 1 levels.",Adult Animals Appetite/drug effects/physiology Beverages Blood-Brain Barrier Brain/*blood supply/*drug effects Cross-Over Studies Female Fructose/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology Glucagon-Like Peptide 1/drug effects/metabolism Glucose/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology Humans Hunger/drug effects/physiology Hypothalamus/blood supply/drug effects Insulin/metabolism Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Rats Regional Blood Flow/*drug effects Reward Single-Blind Method
23989679,Improved blood pressure control associated with a large-scale hypertension program.,JAMA,Jaffe MG and Lee GA and Young JD and Sidney S and Go AS,kp,"IMPORTANCE: Hypertension control for large populations remains a major challenge. OBJECTIVE: To describe a large-scale hypertension program in Northern California and to compare rates of hypertension control in that program with statewide and national estimates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) hypertension program included a multifaceted approach to blood pressure control. Patients identified as having hypertension within an integrated health care delivery system in Northern California from 2001-2009 were included. The comparison group comprised insured patients in California between 2006-2009 who were included in the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) commercial measurement by California health insurance plans participating in the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) quality measure reporting process. A secondary comparison group was included to obtain the reported national mean NCQA HEDIS commercial rates of hypertension control between 2001-2009 from health plans that participated in the NCQA HEDIS quality measure reporting process. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hypertension control as defined by NCQA HEDIS. RESULTS: The KPNC hypertension registry included 349,937 patients when established in 2001 and increased to 652,763 by 2009. The NCQA HEDIS commercial measurement for hypertension control within KPNC increased from 43.6% (95% CI, 39.4%-48.6%) to 80.4% (95% CI, 75.6%-84.4%) during the study period (P < .001 for trend). In contrast, the national mean NCQA HEDIS commercial measurement increased from 55.4% to 64.1%. California mean NCQA HEDIS commercial rates of hypertension were similar to those reported nationally from 2006-2009 (63.4% to 69.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults diagnosed with hypertension, implementation of a large-scale hypertension program was associated with a significant increase in hypertension control compared with state and national control rates. Key elements of the program included a comprehensive hypertension registry, development and sharing of performance metrics, evidence-based guidelines, medical assistant visits for blood pressure measurement, and single-pill combination pharmacotherapy.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use Blood Pressure Determination California Delivery of Health Care, Integrated *Disease Management Evidence-Based Medicine Female Health Maintenance Organizations Humans Hypertension/*therapy Male Middle Aged Practice Guidelines as Topic Process Assessment (Health Care) *Quality Improvement Registries/*statistics & numerical data Treatment Outcome Young Adult"

Relatively few studies have investigated changes in these domains following bariatric surgery. OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in sexual functioning, sex hormone levels, and relevant psychosocial constructs in women who underwent bariatric surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort study of 106 women from phase 2 of the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery who underwent bariatric surgery (median [interquartile range] body mass index, 44.5 [41.4-49.7]). Assessments were completed between 2006 and 2012. INTERVENTIONS: Bariatric surgery was performed by a surgeon certified by the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (85 women underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and 21 women underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sexual functioning was assessed by use of the Female Sexual Function Index. Hormones were assessed by use of a blood assay. Quality of life, body image, depressive symptoms, and marital adjustment were assessed by use of validated questionnaires. RESULTS: Women lost a mean 32.7% (95% CI, 30.7%-34.7%) of initial body weight at postoperative year 1 and a mean 33.5% (95% CI, 31.5%-35.6%) at postoperative year 2. Two years following surgery, women reported significant improvements in overall sexual functioning and specific domains of sexual functioning: arousal, lubrication, desires, and satisfaction. They also experienced significant changes at 2 years in all hormones of interest. Women reported significant improvements in most domains of quality of life, as well as body image and depressive symptoms, within the first year after surgery, with these improvements being maintained through the second postoperative year. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Women who underwent bariatric surgery had significant improvements in overall sexual functioning, in most reproductive hormones of interest, and in psychosocial status.

Traditional hospital personnel often lack the time, skills, and community linkages required to address these factors. OBJECTIVE To determine whether a tailored community health worker (CHW) intervention would improve posthospital outcomes among low-SES patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 2-armed, single-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted between April 10, 2011, and October 30, 2012, at 2 urban, academically affiliated hospitals. Of 683 eligible general medical inpatients (ie, low-income, uninsured, or Medicaid) that we screened, 237 individuals (34.7%) declined to participate. The remaining 446 patients (65.3%) were enrolled and randomly assigned to study arms. Nearly equal percentages of control and intervention group patients completed the follow-up interview (86.6% vs 86.9%). INTERVENTIONS During hospital admission, CHWs worked with patients to create individualized action plans for achieving patients' stated goals for recovery. The CHWs provided support tailored to patient goals for a minimum of 2 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The prespecified primary outcome was completion of primary care follow-up within 14 days of discharge. Prespecified secondary outcomes were quality of discharge communication, self-rated health, satisfaction, patient activation, medication adherence, and 30-day readmission rates. RESULTS Using intention-to-treat analysis, we found that intervention patients were more likely to obtain timely posthospital primary care (60.0% vs 47.9%; P = .02; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.52; 95% CI, 1.03-2.23), to report high-quality discharge communication (91.3% vs 78.7%; P = .002; adjusted OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.5-5.8), and to show greater improvements in mental health (6.7 vs 4.5; P = .02) and patient activation (3.4 vs 1.6; P = .05). There were no significant differences between groups in physical health, satisfaction with medical care, or medication adherence. Similar proportions of patients in both arms experienced at least one 30-day readmission; however, intervention patients were less likely to have multiple 30-day readmissions (2.3% vs 5.5%; P = .08; adjusted OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.14-1.06). Among the subgroup of 63 readmitted patients, recurrent readmission was reduced from 40.0% vs 15.2% (P = .03; adjusted OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.89). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patient-centered CHW intervention improves access to primary care and quality of discharge while controlling recurrent readmissions in a high-risk population. Health systems may leverage the CHW workforce to improve posthospital outcomes by addressing behavioral and socioeconomic drivers of disease.

24366269,Preoperative consultations for medicare patients undergoing cataract surgery.,JAMA Intern Med,Thilen SR and Treggiari MM and Lange JM and Lowy E and Weaver EM and Wijeysundera DN,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Low-risk elective surgical procedures are common, but there are no clear guidelines for when preoperative consultations are required. Such consultations may therefore represent a substantial discretionary service. OBJECTIVE: To assess temporal trends, explanatory factors, and geographic variation for preoperative consultation in Medicare beneficiaries undergoing cataract surgery, a common low-risk elective procedure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort study using a 5% national random sample of Medicare part B claims data including a cohort of 556,637 patients 66 years or older who underwent cataract surgery from 1995 to 2006. Temporal trends in consultations were evaluated within this entire cohort, whereas explanatory factors and geographic variation were evaluated within the 89,817 individuals who underwent surgery from 2005 to 2006. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Separately billed preoperative consultations (performed by family practitioners, general internists, pulmonologists, endocrinologists, cardiologists, nurse practitioners, or anesthesiologists) within 42 days before index surgery. RESULTS: The frequency of preoperative consultations increased from 11.3% in 1998 to 18.4% in 2006. Among individuals who underwent surgery in 2005 to 2006, hierarchical logistic regression modeling found several factors to be associated with preoperative consultation, including increased age (75-84 years vs 66-74 years: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.13]), race (African American race vs other: AOR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.65-0.78]), urban residence (urban residence vs isolated rural town: AOR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.49-1.81]), facility type (outpatient hospital vs ambulatory surgical facility: AOR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.05-1.15]), anesthesia provider (anesthesiologist vs non-medically directed nurse anesthetist: AOR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.10-1.24), and geographic region (Northeast vs South: AOR, 3.09 [95% CI, 2.33-4.10]). The burden of comorbidity was associated with consultation, but the effect size was small (<10%). Variation in frequency of consultation across hospital referral regions was substantial (median [range], 12% [0-69%]), even after accounting for differences in patient-level, anesthesia provider-level, and facility-level characteristics. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Between 1995 and 2006, the frequency of preoperative consultation for cataract surgery increased substantially. Referrals for consultation seem to be primarily driven by nonmedical factors, with substantial geographic variation.","Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over *Cataract Extraction Female Humans Male Medicare *Preoperative Care Referral and Consultation Retrospective Studies Risk Factors United States"

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1378 patients younger than 12 years evaluated for unintentional ingestions: 790 patients before September 30, 2009, and 588 patients after October 1, 2009. MAIN EXPOSURE: Marijuana ingestion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Marijuana exposure visits, marijuana source, symptoms, and patient disposition. RESULTS: The proportion of ingestion visits in patients younger than 12 years (age range, 8 months to 12 years)that were related to marijuana exposure increased after September 30, 2009, from 0 of 790 (0%; 95% CI, 0%-0.6%) to 14 of 588 (2.4%; 95% CI, 1.4%-4.0%) (P < .001). Nine patients had lethargy, 1 had ataxia, and 1 had respiratory insufficiency. Eight patients were admitted, 2 to the intensive care unit. Eight of the 14 cases involved medical marijuana, and 7 of these exposures were from food products. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We found a new appearance of unintentional marijuana ingestions by young children after modification of drug enforcement laws for marijuana possession in Colorado. The consequences of unintentional marijuana exposure in children should be part of the ongoing debate on legalizing marijuana.","Accidents/*statistics & numerical data Cannabis/*poisoning Child Child, Preschool Colorado/epidemiology Emergency Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical data Female Hospitals, Pediatric/statistics & numerical data Humans Infant *Legislation, Drug Male Phytotherapy/*adverse effects Plant Preparations/*poisoning Retrospective Studies Risk Factors"
24135860,"Trends and outcomes for donor oocyte cycles in the United States, 2000-2010.",JAMA,Kawwass JF and Monsour M and Crawford S and Kissin DM and Session DR and Kulkarni AD and Jamieson DJ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of oocyte donation for in vitro fertilization (IVF) has increased in the United States, but little information is available regarding maternal or infant outcomes to improve counseling and clinical decision making. OBJECTIVES: To quantify trends in donor oocyte cycles in the United States and to determine predictors of a good perinatal outcome among IVF cycles using fresh (noncryopreserved) embryos derived from donor oocytes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National ART Surveillance System, to which fertility centers are mandated to report and which includes data on more than 95% of all IVF cycles performed in the United States. Data from 2000 to 2010 described trends. Data from 2010 determined predictors. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Good perinatal outcome, defined as a singleton live-born infant delivered at 37 weeks or later and weighing 2500 g or more. RESULTS: From 2000 to 2010, data from 443 clinics (93% of all US fertility centers) were included. The annual number of donor oocyte cycles significantly increased, from 10,801 to 18,306. Among all donor oocyte cycles, an increasing trend was observed from 2000 to 2010 in the proportion of cycles using frozen (vs fresh) embryos (26.7% [95% CI, 25.8%-27.5%] to 40.3% [95% CI, 39.6%-41.1%]) and elective single-embryo transfers (vs transfer of multiple embryos) (0.8% [95% CI, 0.7%-1.0%] to 14.5% [95% CI, 14.0%-15.1%]). Good perinatal outcomes increased from 18.5% (95% CI, 17.7%-19.3%) to 24.4% (95% CI, 23.8%-25.1%) (P < .001 for all listed trends). Mean donor and recipient ages remained stable at 28 (SD, 2.8) years and 41 (SD, 5.3) years, respectively. In 2010, 396 clinics contributed data. For donor oocyte cycles using fresh embryos (n = 9865), 27.5% (95% CI, 26.6%-28.4%) resulted in good perinatal outcome. Transfer of an embryo at day 5 (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.17 [95% CI, 1.04-1.32]) and elective single-embryo transfers (adjusted OR, 2.32 [95% CI, 1.92-2.80]) were positively associated with good perinatal outcome; tubal (adjusted OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60-0.86]) or uterine (adjusted OR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.58-0.94]) factor infertility and non-Hispanic black recipient race/ethnicity (adjusted OR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.35-0.67]) were associated with decreased odds of good outcome. Recipient age was not associated with likelihood of good perinatal outcome. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the United States from 2000 to 2010, there was an increase in number of donor oocyte cycles, accompanied by an increase in good outcomes. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the factors associated with less successful outcomes.","Adult Birth Weight Counseling Decision Making Female Fertilization in Vitro/*statistics & numerical data Humans Infant, Newborn Middle Aged Oocyte Donation/*statistics & numerical data/trends Pregnancy Pregnancy Outcome Retrospective Studies Single Embryo Transfer/*statistics & numerical data United States"
23800935,Use of advanced treatment technologies among men at low risk of dying from prostate cancer.,JAMA,Jacobs BL and Zhang Y and Schroeck FR and Skolarus TA and Wei JT and Montie JE and Gilbert SM and Strope SA and Dunn RL and Miller DC and Hollenbeck BK,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The use of advanced treatment technologies (ie, intensity-modulated radiotherapy [IMRT] and robotic prostatectomy) for prostate cancer is increasing. The extent to which these advanced treatment technologies have disseminated among patients at low risk of dying from prostate cancer is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the use of advanced treatment technologies, compared with prior standards (ie, traditional external beam radiation treatment [EBRT] and open radical prostatectomy) and observation, among men with a low risk of dying from prostate cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, we identified a retrospective cohort of men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2004 and 2009 who underwent IMRT (n = 23,633), EBRT (n = 3926), robotic prostatectomy (n = 5881), open radical prostatectomy (n = 6123), or observation (n = 16,384). Follow-up data were available through December 31, 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The use of advanced treatment technologies among men unlikely to die from prostate cancer, as assessed by low-risk disease (clinical stage </=T2a, biopsy Gleason score </=6, and prostate-specific antigen level </=10 ng/mL), high risk of noncancer mortality (based on the predicted probability of death within 10 years in the absence of a cancer diagnosis), or both. RESULTS: In our cohort, the use of advanced treatment technologies increased from 32% (95% CI, 30%-33%) to 44% (95% CI, 43%-46%) among men with low-risk disease (P < .001) and from 36% (95% CI, 35%-38%) to 57% (95% CI, 55%-59%) among men with high risk of noncancer mortality (P < .001). The use of these advanced treatment technologies among men with both low-risk disease and high risk of noncancer mortality increased from 25% (95% CI, 23%-28%) to 34% (95% CI, 31%-37%) (P < .001). Among all patients diagnosed in SEER, the use of advanced treatment technologies for men unlikely to die from prostate cancer increased from 13% (95% CI, 12%-14%), or 129.2 per 1000 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, to 24% (95% CI, 24%-25%), or 244.2 per 1000 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (P < .001).

25182099,"Use of and mortality after bilateral mastectomy compared with other surgical treatments for breast cancer in California, 1998-2011.",JAMA,Kurian AW and Lichtensztajn DY and Keegan TH and Nelson DO and Clarke CA and Gomez SL,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Bilateral mastectomy is increasingly used to treat unilateral breast cancer. Because it may have medical and psychosocial complications, a better understanding of its use and outcomes is essential to optimizing cancer care. OBJECTIVE: To compare use of and mortality after bilateral mastectomy, breast-conserving therapy with radiation, and unilateral mastectomy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational cohort study within the population-based California Cancer Registry; participants were women diagnosed with stages 0-III unilateral breast cancer in California from 1998 through 2011, with median follow-up of 89.1 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Factors associated with surgery use (from polytomous logistic regression); overall and breast cancer-specific mortality (from propensity score weighting and Cox proportional hazards analysis). RESULTS: Among 189,734 patients, the rate of bilateral mastectomy increased from 2.0% (95% CI, 1.7%-2.2%) in 1998 to 12.3% (95% CI, 11.8%-12.9%) in 2011, an annual increase of 14.3% (95% CI, 13.1%-15.5%); among women younger than 40 years, the rate increased from 3.6% (95% CI, 2.3%-5.0%) in 1998 to 33% (95% CI, 29.8%-36.5%) in 2011. Bilateral mastectomy was more often used by non-Hispanic white women, those with private insurance, and those who received care at a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated cancer center (8.6% [95% CI, 8.1%-9.2%] among NCI cancer center patients vs 6.0% [95% CI, 5.9%-6.1%] among non-NCI cancer center patients; odds ratio [OR], 1.13 [95% CI, 1.04-1.22]); in contrast, unilateral mastectomy was more often used by racial/ethnic minorities (Filipina, 52.8% [95% CI, 51.6%-54.0%]; OR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.90-2.11] and Hispanic, 45.6% [95% CI, 45.0%-46.2%]; OR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.13-1.20] vs non-Hispanic white, 35.2% [95% CI, 34.9%-35.5%]) and those with public/Medicaid insurance (48.4% [95% CI, 47.8%-48.9%]; OR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.05-1.11] vs private insurance, 36.6% [95% CI, 36.3%-36.8%]). Compared with breast-conserving surgery with radiation (10-year mortality, 16.8% [95% CI, 16.6%-17.1%]), unilateral mastectomy was associated with higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35 [95% CI, 1.32-1.39]; 10-year mortality, 20.1% [95% CI, 19.9%-20.4%]). There was no significant mortality difference compared with bilateral mastectomy (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.94-1.11]; 10-year mortality, 18.8% [95% CI, 18.6%-19.0%]). Propensity analysis showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Use of bilateral mastectomy increased significantly throughout California from 1998 through 2011 and was not associated with lower mortality than that achieved with breast-conserving surgery plus radiation. Unilateral mastectomy was associated with higher mortality than were the other 2 surgical options.","Adult Aged Breast Neoplasms/*mortality/*surgery California/epidemiology Cohort Studies Female Humans Mastectomy, Segmental/*utilization Middle Aged Radiotherapy, Adjuvant Registries/statistics & numerical data Risk SEER Program Surgical Procedures, Elective/*utilization"
23423414,Robotically assisted vs laparoscopic hysterectomy among women with benign gynecologic disease.,JAMA,Wright JD and Ananth CV and Lewin SN and Burke WM and Lu YS and Neugut AI and Herzog TJ and Hershman DL,columbia,"IMPORTANCE: Although robotically assisted hysterectomy for benign gynecologic conditions has been reported, little is known about the incorporation of the procedure into practice, its complication profile, or its costs compared with other routes of hysterectomy. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the uptake of robotically assisted hysterectomy, to determine the association between use of robotic surgery and rates of abdominal and laparoscopic hysterectomy, and to compare the in-house complications of robotically assisted hysterectomy vs abdominal and laparoscopic procedures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Cohort study of 264,758 women who underwent hysterectomy for benign gynecologic disorders at 441 hospitals across the United States from 2007 to 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Uptake of and factors associated with utilization of robotically assisted hysterectomy. Complications, transfusion, reoperation, length of stay, death, and cost for women who underwent robotic hysterectomy compared with both abdominal and laparoscopic procedures were analyzed. RESULTS: Use of robotically assisted hysterectomy increased from 0.5% in 2007 to 9.5% of all hysterectomies in 2010. During the same time period, laparoscopic hysterectomy rates increased from 24.3% to 30.5%. Three years after the first robotic procedure at hospitals where robotically assisted hysterectomy was performed, robotically assisted hysterectomy accounted for 22.4% of all hysterectomies. The rates of abdominal hysterectomy decreased both in hospitals where robotic-assisted hysterectomy was performed as well as in those where it was not performed. In a propensity score-matched analysis, the overall complication rates were similar for robotic-assisted and laparoscopic hysterectomy (5.5% vs 5.3%; relative risk [RR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.86-1.24). Although patients who underwent a robotic-assisted hysterectomy were less likely to have a length of stay longer than 2 days (19.6% vs 24.9%; RR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.67-0.92), transfusion requirements (1.4% vs 1.8%; RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.55-1.16) and the rate of discharge to a nursing facility (0.2% vs 0.3%; RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.35-1.76) were similar. Total costs associated with robotically assisted hysterectomy were $2189 (95% CI, $2030-$2349) more per case than for laparoscopic hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Between 2007 and 2010, the use of robotically assisted hysterectomy for benign gynecologic disorders increased substantially. Robotically assisted and laparoscopic hysterectomy had similar morbidity profiles, but the use of robotic technology resulted in substantially more costs.","Adult Aged Cohort Studies Female Genital Diseases, Female/surgery Health Care Costs Humans Hysterectomy/economics/*methods Laparoscopy/economics/methods/*utilization Middle Aged Postoperative Complications Propensity Score Robotics/economics/methods/*utilization Treatment Outcome United States"
24557566,Current thyroid cancer trends in the United States.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Davies L and Welch HG,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: We have previously reported on a doubling of thyroid cancer incidence-largely due to the detection of small papillary cancers. Because they are commonly found in people who have died of other causes, and because thyroid cancer mortality had been stable, we argued that the increased incidence represented overdiagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether thyroid cancer incidence has stabilized. DESIGN: Analysis of secular trends in patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer, 1975 to 2009, using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and thyroid cancer mortality from the National Vital Statistics System. SETTING: Nine SEER areas (SEER 9): Atlanta, Georgia; Connecticut; Detroit, Michigan; Hawaii; Iowa; New Mexico; San Francisco-Oakland, California; Seattle-Puget Sound, Washington; and Utah. PARTICIPANTS: Men and women older than 18 years diagnosed as having a thyroid cancer between 1975 and 2009 who lived in the SEER 9 areas. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Thyroid cancer incidence, histologic type, tumor size, and patient mortality. RESULTS Since 1975, the incidence of thyroid cancer has now nearly tripled, from 4.9 to 14.3 per 100,000 individuals (absolute increase, 9.4 per 100,000; relative rate [RR], 2.9; 95% CI, 2.7-3.1). Virtually the entire increase was attributable to papillary thyroid cancer: from 3.4 to 12.5 per 100,000 (absolute increase, 9.1 per 100,000; RR, 3.7; 95% CI, 3.4-4.0). The absolute increase in thyroid cancer in women (from 6.5 to 21.4 = 14.9 per 100,000 women) was almost 4 times greater than that of men (from 3.1 to 6.9 = 3.8 per 100,000 men). The mortality rate from thyroid cancer was stable between 1975 and 2009 (approximately 0.5 deaths per 100,000). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is an ongoing epidemic of thyroid cancer in the United States. The epidemiology of the increased incidence, however, suggests that it is not an epidemic of disease but rather an epidemic of diagnosis. The problem is particularly acute for women, who have lower autopsy prevalence of thyroid cancer than men but higher cancer detection rates by a 3:1 ratio.",Adult Aged Female Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Thyroid Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality/pathology/therapy United States/epidemiology

Clinical criteria (ie, the Rome criteria) have been established to aid diagnosis. Studies of adults have shown an increased prevalence of celiac disease among patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); few data are available with regard to children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of celiac disease among children with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders classified according to the Rome criteria. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Six-year (2006-2012) prospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary referral center for the diagnosis and follow-up of gastrointestinal disorders in southern Italy (ie, Bari, Italy). A total of 992 children (42.8% male; median age, 6.8 years) consecutively referred for recurrent abdominal pain by their primary care physicians without previous investigation were evaluated. EXPOSURE: Patients were classified according to Rome III criteria as having IBS, functional dyspepsia, functional abdominal pain, or abdominal migraine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of celiac disease in each category of abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder. Concentrations of IgA, IgA antitissue transglutaminase, and endomysial antibodies were measured, and a duodenal biopsy was performed in case of antibody positivity. RESULTS: A total of 992 children were evaluated: 270 were classified as having IBS, 201 as having functional dyspepsia, and 311 as having functional abdominal pain, and 210 children were excluded from the study because they had an organic disorder or some other functional gastrointestinal disorder (not related to abdominal pain). Serologic testing was performed for all 782 children included in the study, and 15 patients tested positive for celiac disease (12 of 270 patients with IBS [4.4%], 2 of 201 patients with functional dyspepsia [1%], and 1 of 311 patients with functional abdominal pain [0.3%]). Children presenting with IBS have a 4 times higher risk of having celiac disease than children without IBS (odds ratio, 4.19 [95% CI, 2.03-8.49]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The prevalence of celiac disease among children with IBS is 4 times higher than among the general pediatric population. Rome III classification of abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders might help to select children who deserve screening for celiac disease.","Abdominal Pain/epidemiology Adolescent Celiac Disease/*epidemiology Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Female Humans Irritable Bowel Syndrome/*epidemiology Italy/epidemiology Male Prevalence Prospective Studies Questionnaires Severity of Illness Index"

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of VTE in postoperative patients with head and neck cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective study of 100 consecutive patients hospitalized at a tertiary care academic surgical center who underwent surgery to treat head and neck cancer. Routine chemoprophylaxis was not used. On postoperative day (POD) 2 or 3, participants received clinical examination and duplex ultrasonographic evaluation (US). Participants with negative findings on clinical examination and US were followed up clinically; participants with evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) were given therapeutic anticoagulation. Participants with superficial VTE underwent repeated US on POD 4, 5, or 6. Participants were monitored for 30 days after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Total number of new cases of VTE (superficial and deep) identified within 30 days of surgery and confirmed on diagnostic imaging. RESULTS: Of the 111 participants enrolled, 11 withdrew before completing the study; thus, 100 participants were included. The overall incidence of VTE was 13%. Eight participants were identified with clinically significant VTE: 7 DVT and 1 PE. An additional 5 participants had asymptomatic lower extremity superficial VTE detected on US alone. Fourteen percent of patients received some form of postoperative anticoagulation therapy; the rate of bleeding complications in these patients (30.1%) was higher than that in patients without anticoagulation therapy (5.6%) (P = .01).

However, the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC) in patients with DM has seldom been explored. OBJECTIVE: To examine the risk of HNC in patients with DM. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective cohort study using Taiwan's Longitudinal Health Insurance Research Database, we compared 89 089 patients newly diagnosed as having DM and controls without DM-related medical claims matched for comorbidities (obesity, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension), sex, and age. Patients were assessed from the index date until the end of follow-up on December 31, 2011, or until the patient was censored because of death. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The incidence of HNC at the end of 2011. RESULTS: The incidence of HNC was 1.47 times higher in patients newly diagnosed as having DM than was the risk of a first malignant tumor in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.31-1.67). The risks of oral cancer (AHR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.47-2.06), oropharyngeal cancer (AHR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.01-2.31), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (AHR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.03-1.89) were significantly higher in patients with DM than in controls.

DESIGN: The study used 2 waves of longitudinal data from the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence. SETTING: Conducted in 2008 and 2010 on the telephone with respondents from the contiguous United States. PARTICIPANTS: National sample of 1186 youth aged 10 to 17 years in wave 1. MAIN EXPOSURES: Peer victimization, sexual assault, witnessing family violence, exposure to community violence, and maltreatment by a parent/caregiver. OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-report suicidal ideation in the past month. RESULTS: Controlling for demographic characteristics, internalizing disorder diagnoses, and wave 1 suicidal ideation, findings showed independent effects of peer victimization, sexual assault, and maltreatment by a parent/caregiver on suicidal ideation at wave 2. The risk of suicidal ideation was 2.4 times greater among youth who experienced peer victimization in the past year, 3.4 times greater among those who were sexually assaulted, and 4.4 times greater among those exposed to maltreatment, relative to children who were not exposed to these types of victimization. Findings also showed substantial effects of polyvictimization (exposure to 7 or more individual types of victimization in the past year), with polyvictims almost 6 times more likely to report suicidal ideation. CONCLUSION: Findings point to the importance of recent victimization in increasing risk of suicidal ideation in adolescents and suggest the need for victimization assessments among all youth who are believed to be at risk for suicidal ideation.",Adolescent Bullying/*psychology Child Crime Victims/*psychology Domestic Violence/psychology Female Health Surveys Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Self Report Sex Offenses/psychology *Suicidal Ideation United States Violence/*psychology
24686924,Effect of hospitalist workload on the quality and efficiency of care.,JAMA Intern Med,Elliott DJ and Young RS and Brice J and Aguiar R and Kolm P,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Hospitalist physicians face increasing pressure to maximize productivity, which may undermine the efficiency and quality of care. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between hospitalist workload and the efficiency and quality of inpatient care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 20,241 admissions of inpatients cared for by a private hospitalist group at a large academic community hospital system between February 1, 2008, and January 31, 2011. EXPOSURES: Daily hospitalist workload as measured by relative value units and patient encounters from the hospitalist billing records. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were length of stay (LOS), cost, rapid response team activation, in-hospital mortality, patient satisfaction, and 30-day readmission rates. Key covariates included hospital occupancy and patient-level characteristics. RESULTS: The LOS increased as workload increased, particularly at lower hospital occupancy. For hospital occupancies less than 75%, LOS increased from 5.5 to 7.5 days as workload increased. For occupancies of 75% to 85%, LOS increased exponentially above a daily relative value unit of approximately 25 and a census value of approximately 15. At high occupancy (>85%), LOS was J-shaped, with significant increases at higher ranges of workload. After controlling for LOS, cost increased by $111 for each 1-unit increase in relative value unit and $205 for each 1-unit increase in census across the range of values. Changes in workload were not associated with the remaining outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Increasing hospitalist workload is associated with clinically meaningful increases in LOS and cost. Although our findings should be validated in different clinical settings, our results suggest the need for methods to mitigate the potential negative effects of increased hospitalist workload on the efficiency and cost of care.","Academic Medical Centers/economics/organization & administration Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies *Efficiency, Organizational Female Hospital Costs/statistics & numerical data *Hospital Mortality Hospital Rapid Response Team/*utilization Hospitalists/*organization & administration/standards Humans Length of Stay/*statistics & numerical data Male Middle Aged Patient Readmission/*statistics & numerical data Patient Satisfaction/statistics & numerical data Quality of Health Care/economics/statistics & numerical data Retrospective Studies United States Workload/economics/*statistics & numerical data"
24577222,"Indoor tanning among high school students in the United States, 2009 and 2011.",JAMA Dermatol,Guy GP Jr and Berkowitz Z and Tai E and Holman DM and Everett Jones S and Richardson LC,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Indoor tanning is associated with an increased risk of skin cancer, including melanoma, and is particularly dangerous for younger and more frequent indoor tanners. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of indoor tanning and frequent indoor tanning (>/=10 times during the 12 months before each survey) and their association with health-related behaviors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study examined data from the 2009 and 2011 national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys, which used nationally representative samples of US high school students representing approximately 15.5 million students each survey year. The study included 25,861 students who answered the indoor tanning question. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The prevalence of indoor tanning and frequent indoor tanning were examined as well as their association with demographic characteristics and health-related behaviors using multivariable logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: The prevalence of indoor tanning was greater among female, older, and non-Hispanic white students. Indoor tanning was highest among female students aged 18 years or older, with 31.5% engaging in indoor tanning in 2011, and among non-Hispanic white female students, with 29.3% engaging in indoor tanning in 2011. Among female students, the adjusted prevalence of indoor tanning decreased from 26.4% in 2009 to 20.7% in 2011. Among female and male students, indoor tanning was associated with other risk-taking behaviors, such as binge drinking (P < .001 and P = .006, respectively), unhealthy weight control practices (P < .001, for both), and having sexual intercourse (P < .001, for both). Additionally, indoor tanning among female students was associated with using illegal drugs (P < .001) and having sexual intercourse with 4 or more persons (P = .03); use among male students was associated with taking steroids without a physician's prescription (P < .001), smoking cigarettes daily (P = .03), and attempting suicide (P = .006). More than half of respondents engaging in indoor tanning reported frequent use of the devices. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Indoor tanning is common among high school students. Public health efforts are needed to change social norms regarding tanned skin and to increase awareness, knowledge, and behaviors related to indoor tanning.

23938610,Association of autism with induced or augmented childbirth in North Carolina Birth Record (1990-1998) and Education Research (1997-2007) databases.,JAMA Pediatr,Gregory SG and Anthopolos R and Osgood CE and Grotegut CA and Miranda ML,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: One in 88 children in the United States is diagnosed as having autism spectrum disorder. Significant interest centers on understanding the environmental factors that may contribute to autism risk. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether induced (stimulating uterine contractions prior to the onset of spontaneous labor) and/or augmented (increasing the strength, duration, or frequency of uterine contractions with spontaneous onset of labor) births are associated with increased odds of autism. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed an epidemiological analysis using multivariable logistic regression modeling involving the North Carolina Detailed Birth Record and Education Research databases. The study featured 625,042 live births linked with school records, including more than 5500 children with a documented exceptionality designation for autism. EXPOSURES: Induced or augmented births. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Autism as assessed by exceptionality designations in child educational records. RESULTS: Compared with children born to mothers who received neither labor induction nor augmentation, children born to mothers who were induced and augmented, induced only, or augmented only experienced increased odds of autism after controlling for potential confounders related to socioeconomic status, maternal health, pregnancy-related events and conditions, and birth year. The observed associations between labor induction/augmentation were particularly pronounced in male children. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our work suggests that induction/augmentation during childbirth is associated with increased odds of autism diagnosis in childhood. While these results are interesting, further investigation is needed to differentiate among potential explanations of the association including underlying pregnancy conditions requiring the eventual need to induce/augment, the events of labor and delivery associated with induction/augmentation, and the specific treatments and dosing used to induce/augment labor (e.g., exogenous oxytocin and prostaglandins).","Autistic Disorder/epidemiology/*etiology Birth Certificates Child Female Humans Labor, Induced/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data Labor, Obstetric/*drug effects Logistic Models Male North Carolina/epidemiology Obstetric Labor Complications Pregnancy Risk Schools Sex Factors"

Darapladib is an oral, selective inhibitor of the Lp-PLA2 enzyme. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of darapladib in patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: SOLID-TIMI 52 was a multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized 13,026 participants within 30 days of hospitalization with an ACS (non-ST-elevation or ST-elevation myocardial infarction [MI]) at 868 sites in 36 countries. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to either once-daily darapladib (160 mg) or placebo on a background of guideline-recommended therapy. Patients were followed up for a median of 2.5 years between December 7, 2009, and December 6, 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point (major coronary events) was the composite of coronary heart disease (CHD) death, MI, or urgent coronary revascularization for myocardial ischemia. Kaplan-Meier event rates are reported at 3 years. RESULTS: During a median duration of 2.5 years, the primary end point occurred in 903 patients in the darapladib group and 910 in the placebo group (16.3% vs 15.6% at 3 years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.00 [95% CI, 0.91-1.09]; P = .93). The composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke occurred in 824 in the darapladib group and 838 in the placebo group (15.0% vs 15.0% at 3 years; HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.90-1.09]; P = .78). There were no differences between the treatment groups for additional secondary end points, for individual components of the primary end point, or in all-cause mortality (371 events in the darapladib group and 395 in the placebo group [7.3% vs 7.1% at 3 years; HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.82-1.08]; P = .40). Patients were more likely to report an odor-related concern in the darapladib group vs the placebo group (11.5% vs 2.5%) and also more likely to report diarrhea (10.6% vs 5.6%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients who experienced an ACS event, direct inhibition of Lp-PLA2 with darapladib added to optimal medical therapy and initiated within 30 days of hospitalization did not reduce the risk of major coronary events.

2013,"Rapid infusion of sodium bicarbonate and albumin into high-risk premature infants soon after birth: a controlled, prospective trial.",Am J Obstet Gynecol,Bland RD and Clarke TL and Harden LB,Missing,"We conducted a controlled, prospective trial to evaluate the effectiveness of rapidly infusing sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and salt-poor albumin into high-risk, premature infants in the first 2 hours of life. Fifty-three infants, randomized into one of four treatment groups, received 8 ml. per kilogram of a solution containing either (A) glucose in water, (B) salt-poor albumin, (C) NaHCO3, or (D) a combination of albumin and NaHCO3. After the initial infusion, the babies received no colloid or alkali solutions until 4 hours of age. We managed them supportively with warmth, appropriate oxygen administration, isotonic fluid infusion, and close monitoring. Among the infants who received alkali, 14 of 26 acquired the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 11 died, and four had intracranial hemorrhage. Among babies who received no alkali, RDS occurred in 11 of 27, 5 died, and none had intracranial hemorrhage. These results do not support the common practice of rapidly infusing NaHCO3 into high-risk, premature infants, and they suggest that the early management of such infants needs renewed critical evaluation.","Acidosis/*drug therapy Albumins/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Bicarbonates/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Carbon Dioxide/blood Cerebral Hemorrhage/mortality Female Hawaii Humans Hydrogen-Ion Concentration Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature, Diseases/blood/*drug therapy/mortality Infusions, Parenteral Male Prospective Studies Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/mortality Sodium/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Time Factors"

OBJECTIVE: To describe the US burden, rates, and characteristics of emergency department (ED) visits and emergency hospitalizations for IHEs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative public health surveillance of adverse drug events among insulin-treated patients seeking ED care (National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance project) and a national household survey of insulin use (the National Health Interview Survey) were used to obtain data from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2011. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimated annual numbers and estimated annual rates of ED visits and hospitalizations for IHEs among insulin-treated patients with diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: Based on 8100 National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance cases, an estimated 97,648 (95% CI, 64,410-130,887) ED visits for IHEs occurred annually; almost one-third (29.3%; 95% CI, 21.8%-36.8%) resulted in hospitalization. Severe neurologic sequelae were documented in an estimated 60.6% (95% CI, 51.3%-69.9%) of ED visits for IHEs, and blood glucose levels of 50 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555) or less were recorded in more than half of cases (53.4%). Insulin-treated patients 80 years or older were more than twice as likely to visit the ED (rate ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.3) and nearly 5 times as likely to be subsequently hospitalized (rate ratio, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.6-9.1) for IHEs than those 45 to 64 years. The most commonly identified IHE precipitants were reduced food intake and administration of the wrong insulin product. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Rates of ED visits and subsequent hospitalizations for IHEs were highest in patients 80 years or older; the risks of hypoglycemic sequelae in this age group should be considered in decisions to prescribe and intensify insulin. Meal-planning misadventures and insulin product mix-ups are important targets for hypoglycemia prevention efforts.","Age Factors Data Collection Diabetes Mellitus/drug therapy Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/economics/epidemiology Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data Female Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data Humans Hypoglycemia/*chemically induced Hypoglycemic Agents/*adverse effects Insulin/*adverse effects Male Medication Errors/economics/*statistics & numerical data Public Health Surveillance Sex Factors United States/epidemiology"
24554245,Use of hospital-based services among young adults with behavioral health diagnoses before and after health insurance expansions.,JAMA Psychiatry,Meara E and Golberstein E and Zaha R and Greenfield SF and Beardslee WR and Busch SH,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Young adults have high levels of behavioral health needs but often lack health insurance. Recent health reforms have increased coverage, but it is unclear how use of hospital-based care changed after expanding insurance. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between health insurance coverage expansions and use of hospital-based care among young adults with behavioral health diagnoses. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Quasi-experimental analyses of community hospital inpatient and emergency department use from 2003-2009 based on hospital discharge data, comparing differential changes in service use among young adults with behavioral health diagnoses in Massachusetts vs other states before and after Massachusetts' 2006 health reform. This population-based sample included inpatient admissions (n = 2,533,307, representing 12,821,746 weighted admissions across 7 years) nationwide and emergency department visits (n = 6,817,855 across 7 years) from Maryland and Massachusetts for 12- to 25-year-old patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Inpatient admission rates per 1000 population for primary diagnosis of any behavioral health disorder by diagnosis; emergency department visit rates per 1000 population by behavioral health diagnosis; and insurance coverage for hospital discharges. RESULTS: After 2006, uninsurance among 19- to 25-year-old individuals in Massachusetts decreased from 26% to 10% (16 percentage points; 95% CI, 13-20). Young adults experienced relative declines in inpatient admission rates of 2.0 per 1000 for primary diagnoses of any behavioral health disorder (95% CI, 0.95-3.2), 0.38 for depression (95% CI, 0.18-0.58), and 1.3 for substance use disorder (95% CI, 0.68-1.8). The increase in emergency department visits with any behavioral health diagnosis after 2006 was lower among young adults in Massachusetts compared with Maryland (16.5 per 1000; 95% CI, 11.4-21.6). Among young adults in Massachusetts, the percentage of behavioral health discharges that were uninsured decreased by 5.0 (95% CI, 3.0-7.2) percentage points in inpatient settings and 5.0 (95% CI, 1.7-7.8) percentage points in emergency departments relative to other states. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Expanded health insurance coverage for young adults was not associated with large increases in hospital-based care for behavioral health, but it increased financial protection for young adults with behavioral health diagnoses and for the hospitals that care for them.","Adolescent Child Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy Emergency Service, Hospital/utilization Female Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data Hospitals, Community/utilization Humans Insurance Coverage/*utilization Insurance, Psychiatric/*utilization Male Maryland Massachusetts Medically Uninsured/statistics & numerical data Mental Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*therapy Substance-Related Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy Utilization Review Young Adult"
24493100,Cognitive function and brain structure in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus after intensive lowering of blood pressure and lipid levels: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA Intern Med,Williamson JD and Launer LJ and Bryan RN and Coker LH and Lazar RM and Gerstein HC and Murray AM and Sullivan MD and Horowitz KR and Ding J and Marcovina S and Lovato L and Lovato J and Margolis KL and Davatzikos C and Barzilay J and Ginsberg HN and Linz PE and Miller ME,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at increased risk for decline in cognitive function, reduced brain volume, and increased white matter lesions in the brain. Poor control of blood pressure (BP) and lipid levels are risk factors for T2DM-related cognitive decline, but the effect of intensive treatment on brain function and structure is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether intensive therapy for hypertension and combination therapy with a statin plus a fibrate reduces the risk of decline in cognitive function and total brain volume (TBV) in patients with T2DM. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A North American multicenter clinical trial including 2977 participants without baseline clinical evidence of cognitive impairment or dementia and with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels less than 7.5% randomized to a systolic BP goal of less than 120 vs less than 140 mm Hg (n = 1439) or to a fibrate vs placebo in patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels less than 100 mg/dL (n = 1538). Participants were recruited from August 1, 2003, through October 31, 2005, with the final follow-up visit by June 30, 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognition was assessed at baseline and 20 and 40 months. A subset of 503 participants underwent baseline and 40-month brain magnetic resonance imaging to assess for change in TBV and other structural measures of brain health. RESULTS: Baseline mean HbA1c level was 8.3%; mean age, 62 years; and mean duration of T2DM, 10 years. At 40 months, no differences in cognitive function were found in the intensive BP-lowering trial or in the fibrate trial. At 40 months, TBV had declined more in the intensive vs standard BP-lowering group (difference, -4.4 [95% CI, -7.8 to -1.1] cm(3); P = .01). Fibrate therapy had no effect on TBV compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In participants with long-standing T2DM and at high risk for cardiovascular events, intensive BP control and fibrate therapy in the presence of controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not produce a measurable effect on cognitive decline at 40 months of follow-up. Intensive BP control was associated with greater decline in TBV at 40 months relative to standard therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of a long-term intensive weight-loss intervention with the frequency of remission from type 2 diabetes to prediabetes or normoglycemia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Ancillary observational analysis of a 4-year randomized controlled trial (baseline visit, August 2001-April 2004; last follow-up, April 2008) comparing an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) with a diabetes support and education control condition (DSE) among 4503 US adults with body mass index of 25 or higher and type 2 diabetes. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive the ILI, which included weekly group and individual counseling in the first 6 months followed by 3 sessions per month for the second 6 months and twice-monthly contact and regular refresher group series and campaigns in years 2 to 4 (n=2241) or the DSE, which was an offer of 3 group sessions per year on diet, physical activity, and social support (n=2262). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Partial or complete remission of diabetes, defined as transition from meeting diabetes criteria to a prediabetes or nondiabetic level of glycemia (fasting plasma glucose <126 mg/dL and hemoglobin A1c <6.5% with no antihyperglycemic medication). RESULTS Intensive lifestyle intervention participants lost significantly more weight than DSE participants at year 1 (net difference, -7.9%; 95% CI, -8.3% to -7.6%) and at year 4 (-3.9%; 95% CI, -4.4% to -3.5%) and had greater fitness increases at year 1 (net difference, 15.4%; 95% CI, 13.7%-17.0%) and at year 4 (6.4%; 95% CI, 4.7%-8.1%) (P < .001 for each). The ILI group was significantly more likely to experience any remission (partial or complete), with prevalences of 11.5% (95% CI, 10.1%-12.8%) during the first year and 7.3% (95% CI, 6.2%-8.4%) at year 4, compared with 2.0% for the DSE group at both time points (95% CIs, 1.4%-2.6% at year 1 and 1.5%-2.7% at year 4) (P < .001 for each). Among ILI participants, 9.2% (95% CI, 7.9%-10.4%), 6.4% (95% CI, 5.3%-7.4%), and 3.5% (95% CI, 2.7%-4.3%) had continuous, sustained remission for at least 2, at least 3, and 4 years, respectively, compared with less than 2% of DSE participants (1.7% [95% CI, 1.2%-2.3%] for at least 2 years; 1.3% [95% CI, 0.8%-1.7%] for at least 3 years; and 0.5% [95% CI, 0.2%-0.8%] for 4 years). CONCLUSIONS: In these exploratory analyses of overweight adults, an intensive lifestyle intervention was associated with a greater likelihood of partial remission of type 2 diabetes compared with diabetes support and education.

OBJECTIVE: To further investigate the role of IL-17F in predicting treatment response to interferon beta-1b in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis using the Singulex Erenna IL-17F immunoassay. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Serum samples were analyzed from 239 randomly selected patients treated with interferon beta-1b, 250 mug, for at least 2 years in the Betaferon Efficacy Yielding Outcomes of a New Dose Study. EXPOSURE: Treatment with interferon beta-1b, 250 mug, for at least 2 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Levels of IL-17F at baseline and month 6 as well as the difference between the IL-17F levels at month 6 and baseline were compared between the following: (1) patients with less disease activity vs more disease activity; (2) patients with no disease activity vs some disease activity; and (3) responders vs nonresponders. RESULTS: Levels of IL-17F measured at baseline and month 6 did not correlate with lack of response to treatment after 2 years using clinical and magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Relapses and new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging were not associated with pretreatment serum IL-17F levels. When patients with neutralizing antibodies were excluded, the results did not change. All patients with levels of IL-17F greater than 200 pg/mL were associated with poor response with some clinical or radiological activity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: An increase of IL-17F before and early after treatment with interferon beta-1b was not associated with poor response. These data do not support the value of IL-17F as a treatment response indicator for therapy of patients with multiple sclerosis with interferon beta, although high levels of IL-17F greater than 200 pg/mL may predict nonresponsiveness.","Adult Disability Evaluation Disease Progression Female Humans Immunoassay/methods Interferon-beta/*administration & dosage/*physiology/therapeutic use Interleukin-17/*biosynthesis/blood/physiology Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/*drug therapy/immunology/*metabolism Random Allocation Time Factors Treatment Outcome"

OBJECTIVE: To identify clinician attitudes regarding the meaning, implication, and timing of the DNR order for pediatric patients. DESIGN: Physicians and nurses from practice settings where advance care planning typically takes place were surveyed regarding their attitudes and behaviors about DNR orders. RESULTS: In total, 107 physicians and 159 nurses responded to the survey (N = 266). There was substantial variability in the interpretation of the DNR order. Most clinicians (66.9%) believe that a DNR order indicates limitation of resuscitative measures only on cardiopulmonary arrest. In reality, however, more than 85% believe that care changes beyond response to cardiopulmonary arrest, varying from increased attention to comfort to less clinician attentiveness. In addition, most clinicians reported that resuscitation status discussions take place later in the illness course than is ideal. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Clinicians use the DNR order not only as a guide for therapeutic decisions during a cardiopulmonary arrest but also as a surrogate for broader treatment directives. Most clinicians believe that DNR discussions should take place earlier than they actually do. Interventions aimed at improving clinician knowledge and skills in advance care discussions as well as the development of orders that address overall goals of care may improve care for children with serious illness.",Advance Care Planning/*organization & administration *Attitude of Health Personnel Boston Critical Illness/nursing/*therapy Data Collection *Decision Making Female Heart Arrest/therapy Humans Male Nurses/*statistics & numerical data Physicians/*statistics & numerical data Resuscitation Orders/ethics/*psychology

New weight management strategies are necessary for this population. Weight gain prevention might be an effective treatment option, with particular benefits for overweight and class 1 obese black women. OBJECTIVE: To compare changes in weight and cardiometabolic risk during a 12-month period among black women randomized to a primary care-based behavioral weight gain prevention intervention, relative to usual care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Two-arm randomized clinical trial (the Shape Program). We recruited patients from a 6-site community health center system. We randomized 194 overweight and class 1 obese (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], 25-34.9) premenopausal black women aged 25 to 44 years. Enrollment began on December 7, 2009; 12- and 18-month assessments were completed in February and October 2, 2012. INTERVENTIONS: The medium-intensity intervention included tailored behavior change goals, weekly self-monitoring via interactive voice response, monthly counseling calls, tailored skills training materials, and a gym membership. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Twelve-month change in weight and body mass index and maintenance of change at 18 months. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 35.4 years, a mean weight of 81.1 kg, and a mean body mass index of 30.2 at baseline. Most were socioeconomically disadvantaged (79.7% with educational level less than a college degree; 74.3% reporting annual income <$30,000). The 12-month weight change was larger among intervention participants (mean [SD], -1.0 [0.5] kg), relative to usual care (0.5 [0.5] kg; mean difference, -1.4 kg [95% CI, -2.8 to -0.1 kg]; P = .04). At month 12, 62% of intervention participants were at or below their baseline weights compared with 45% of usual-care participants (P = .03). By 18 months, intervention participants maintained significantly larger changes in weight (mean difference, -1.7 kg; 95% CI, -3.3 to -0.2 kg). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A medium-intensity primary care-based behavioral intervention demonstrated efficacy for weight gain prevention among socioeconomically disadvantaged black women. A ""maintain, don't gain"" approach might be a useful alternative treatment for reducing obesity-associated disease risk among some premenopausal black women.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a web-based intervention, the Teen Driving Plan (TDP), can improve the driving performance of teenagers before licensure as measured by the Teen On-road Driving Assessment (tODA). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, single-blind, clinical trial among 217 dyads (1 parent: 1 teenaged learner's-permit holder) to test TDP effectiveness on increasing the quantity and diversity of supervised practice and improving the teenagers' prelicensed driving performance. The study was conducted from December 2011 through January 2013 in Southeastern Pennsylvania. INTERVENTIONS: Dyads were randomized (3:2) to receive the TDP or the Pennsylvania driver's manual (control group). The TDP is a psychoeducational intervention designed to increase the quantity and diversity of parent-supervised practice. Materials are grouped by the following driving environments: empty parking lots, suburban residential streets, intermediate (1- or 2-lane) roads, highways, rural roads with curves and elevation changes, and commercial districts. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were self-reported practice driving across 6 environments and 2 conditions and driving performance as measured by the teenagers' completion of the standardized and validated tODA 24 weeks after enrollment. Certified professional driving evaluators blinded to randomization status terminated the tODA if they determined that the teenager could not safely complete it. We examined mean differences in the quantity of supervised practice, differences in the overall proportion of teenagers in each group that had assessments terminated for unsafe driving, and the point of termination during the assessment. RESULTS: The TDP dyads reported more practice in 5 of the 6 environments and at night and in bad weather compared with the control dyads. Overall, 5 of 86 TDP teenagers (6%) had the tODA terminated compared with 10 of 65 control teenagers (15%) (risk difference [TDP - control], -9% [95% CI, -21% to 2%]; P = .06). The hazard ratio for exposure to TDP was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.12-1.03; P = .05, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Preliminary evidence suggests that the TDP improves supervised practice and the driving performance of prelicensed teenaged drivers. Future studies can explore how to revise the TDP to enhance the treatment effect and how best to disseminate the TDP without compromising implementation fidelity.

Practical, robust, and sustainable models are needed to improve BP control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether an intervention combining home BP telemonitoring with pharmacist case management improves BP control compared with usual care and to determine whether BP control is maintained after the intervention is stopped. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A cluster randomized clinical trial of 450 adults with uncontrolled BP recruited from 14,692 patients with electronic medical records across 16 primary care clinics in an integrated health system in Minneapolis-St Paul, Minnesota, with 12 months of intervention and 6 months of postintervention follow-up. INTERVENTIONS: Eight clinics were randomized to provide usual care to patients (n = 222) and 8 clinics were randomized to provide a telemonitoring intervention (n = 228). Intervention patients received home BP telemonitors and transmitted BP data to pharmacists who adjusted antihypertensive therapy accordingly. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Control of systolic BP to less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP to less than 90 mm Hg (<130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease) at 6 and 12 months.

Blood pressure was controlled at both 6 and 12 months in 57.2% (95% CI, 44.8% to 68.7%) of patients in the telemonitoring intervention group vs 30.0% (95% CI, 23.2% to 37.8%) of patients in the usual care group (P = .001). At 18 months (6 months of postintervention follow-up), BP was controlled in 71.8% (95% CI, 65.0% to 77.8%) of patients in the telemonitoring intervention group vs 57.1% (95% CI, 51.5% to 62.6%) of patients in the usual care group (P = .003). Compared with the usual care group, systolic BP decreased more from baseline among patients in the telemonitoring intervention group at 6 months (-10.7 mm Hg [95% CI, -14.3 to -7.3 mm Hg]; P<.001), at 12 months (-9.7 mm Hg [95% CI, -13.4 to -6.0 mm Hg]; P<.001), and at 18 months (-6.6 mm Hg [95% CI, -10.7 to -2.5 mm Hg]; P = .004). Compared with the usual care group, diastolic BP decreased more from baseline among patients in the telemonitoring intervention group at 6 months (-6.0 mm Hg [95% CI, -8.6 to -3.4 mm Hg]; P<.001), at 12 months (-5.1 mm Hg [95% CI, -7.4 to -2.8 mm Hg]; P<.001), and at 18 months (-3.0 mm Hg [95% CI, -6.3 to 0.3 mm Hg]; P = .07). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Home BP telemonitoring and pharmacist case management achieved better BP control compared with usual care during 12 months of intervention that persisted during 6 months of postintervention follow-up.

25138333,Sustained care intervention and postdischarge smoking cessation among hospitalized adults: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Rigotti NA and Regan S and Levy DE and Japuntich S and Chang Y and Park ER and Viana JC and Kelley JH and Reyen M and Singer DE,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Health care systems need effective models to manage chronic diseases like tobacco dependence across transitions in care. Hospitalizations provide opportunities for smokers to quit, but research suggests that hospital-delivered interventions are effective only if treatment continues after discharge. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intervention to sustain tobacco treatment after hospital discharge increases smoking cessation rates compared with standard care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial compared sustained care (a postdischarge tobacco cessation intervention) with standard care among 397 hospitalized daily smokers (mean age, 53 years; 48% were males; 81% were non-Hispanic whites) who wanted to quit smoking after discharge and received a tobacco dependence intervention in the hospital; 92% of eligible patients and 44% of screened patients enrolled. The study was conducted from August 2010 through November 2012 at Massachusetts General Hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Sustained care participants received automated interactive voice response telephone calls and their choice of free smoking cessation medication (any type approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) for up to 90 days. The automated telephone calls promoted cessation, provided medication management, and triaged smokers for additional counseling. Standard care participants received recommendations for postdischarge pharmacotherapy and counseling. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was biochemically confirmed past 7-day tobacco abstinence at 6-month follow-up after discharge from the hospital; secondary outcomes included self-reported tobacco abstinence. RESULTS: Smokers randomly assigned to sustained care (n = 198) used more counseling and more pharmacotherapy at each follow-up assessment than those assigned to standard care (n = 199). Biochemically validated 7-day tobacco abstinence at 6 months was higher with sustained care (26%) than with standard care (15%) (relative risk [RR], 1.71 [95% CI, 1.14-2.56], P = .009; number needed to treat, 9.4 [95% CI, 5.4-35.5]). Using multiple imputation for missing outcomes, the RR for 7-day tobacco abstinence was 1.55 (95% CI, 1.03-2.21; P = .04). Sustained care also resulted in higher self-reported continuous abstinence rates for 6 months after discharge (27% vs 16% for standard care; RR, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.15-2.51]; P = .007). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among hospitalized adult smokers who wanted to quit smoking, a postdischarge intervention providing automated telephone calls and free medication resulted in higher rates of smoking cessation at 6 months compared with a standard recommendation to use counseling and medication after discharge. These findings, if replicated, suggest an approach to help achieve sustained smoking cessation after a hospital stay.

24934845,Comparative effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention to improve adherence to annual colorectal cancer screening in community health centers: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA Intern Med,Baker DW and Brown T and Buchanan DR and Weil J and Balsley K and Ranalli L and Lee JY and Cameron KA and Ferreira MR and Stephens Q and Goldman SN and Rademaker A and Wolf MS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates are lower among Latinos and people living in poverty. Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) is one recommended screening modality that may overcome cost and access barriers. However, the ability of FOBT to reduce CRC mortality depends on high rates of adherence to annual screening. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a multifaceted intervention increases adherence to annual FOBT compared with usual care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patient-level randomized controlled trial conducted in a network of community health centers. Included were 450 patients who had previously completed a home FOBT from March 2011 through February 2012 and had a negative test result: 72% of participants were women; 87% were Latino; 83% stated that Spanish was their preferred language; and 77% were uninsured. INTERVENTIONS: Usual care at participating health centers included computerized reminders, standing orders for medical assistants to give patients home fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), and clinician feedback on CRC screening rates. The intervention group also received (1) a mailed reminder letter, a free FIT with low-literacy instructions, and a postage-paid return envelope; (2) an automated telephone and text message reminding them that they were due for screening and that a FIT was being mailed to them; (3) an automated telephone and text reminder 2 weeks later for those who did not return the FIT; and (4) personal telephone outreach by a CRC screening navigator after 3 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Completion of FOBT within 6 months of the date the patient was due for annual screening. RESULTS: Intervention patients were much more likely than those in usual care to complete FOBT (82.2% vs 37.3%; P < .001). Of the 185 intervention patients completing screening, 10.2% completed prior to their due date (intervention was not given), 39.6% within 2 weeks (after initial intervention), 24.0% within 2 to 13 weeks (after automated call/text reminder), and 8.4% between 13 and 26 weeks (after personal call). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This intervention greatly increased adherence to annual CRC screening; most screenings were achieved without personal calls. It is possible to improve annual CRC screening for vulnerable populations with relatively low-cost strategies that are facilitated by health information technologies.

23757082,Effect of an outpatient antimicrobial stewardship intervention on broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing by primary care pediatricians: a randomized trial.,JAMA,Gerber JS and Prasad PA and Fiks AG and Localio AR and Grundmeier RW and Bell LM and Wasserman RC and Keren R and Zaoutis TE,chop,"IMPORTANCE: Antimicrobial stewardship programs have been effective for inpatients, often through prescribing audit and feedback. However, most antimicrobial use occurs in outpatients with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of an antimicrobial stewardship intervention on antibiotic prescribing for pediatric outpatients. DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial of outpatient antimicrobial stewardship comparing prescribing between intervention and control practices using a common electronic health record. After excluding children with chronic medical conditions, antibiotic allergies, and prior antibiotic use, we estimated prescribing rates for targeted ARTIs standardized for age, sex, race, and insurance from 20 months before the intervention to 12 months afterward (October 2008-June 2011). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A network of 25 pediatric primary care practices in Pennsylvania and New Jersey; 18 practices (162 clinicians) participated. INTERVENTIONS: One 1-hour on-site clinician education session (June 2010) followed by 1 year of personalized, quarterly audit and feedback of prescribing for bacterial and viral ARTIs or usual practice. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of broad-spectrum (off-guideline) antibiotic prescribing for bacterial ARTIs and antibiotics for viral ARTIs for 1 year after the intervention. RESULTS: Broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing decreased from 26.8% to 14.3% (absolute difference, 12.5%) among intervention practices vs from 28.4% to 22.6% (absolute difference, 5.8%) in controls (difference of differences [DOD], 6.7%; P = .01 for differences in trajectories). Off-guideline prescribing for children with pneumonia decreased from 15.7% to 4.2% among intervention practices compared with 17.1% to 16.3% in controls (DOD, 10.7%; P < .001) and for acute sinusitis from 38.9% to 18.8% in intervention practices and from 40.0% to 33.9% in controls (DOD, 14.0%; P = .12). Off-guideline prescribing was uncommon at baseline and changed little for streptococcal pharyngitis (intervention, from 4.4% to 3.4%; control, from 5.6% to 3.5%; DOD, -1.1%; P = .82) and for viral infections (intervention, from 7.9% to 7.7%; control, from 6.4% to 4.5%; DOD, -1.7%; P = .93). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this large pediatric primary care network, clinician education coupled with audit and feedback, compared with usual practice, improved adherence to prescribing guidelines for common bacterial ARTIs, and the intervention did not affect antibiotic prescribing for viral infections. Future studies should examine the drivers of these effects, as well as the generalizability, sustainability, and clinical outcomes of outpatient antimicrobial stewardship.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC) as a marker of intracranial atherosclerosis and the risk of stroke in whites. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A population-based cohort study in the general community with 6 years of follow-up was conducted (the Rotterdam Study). Between 2003 and 2006, a random sample of 2323 stroke-free persons (mean age, 69.5 years) underwent computed tomography scanning to quantify ICAC volume. All participants were continuously monitored for the occurrence of stroke until January 1, 2012. EXPOSURE: Atherosclerotic calcification in the intracranial internal carotid arteries. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Incident stroke. RESULTS: During 14,055 person-years of follow-up, 91 participants had a stroke, of which 74 were ischemic. Larger ICAC volume was related to a higher risk of stroke, independent of cardiovascular risk factors, ultrasound carotid plaque score, and calcification in other vessels (fully adjusted hazard ratio per an increase of 1 SD in ICAC volume, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.04-1.96]). Intracranial carotid artery calcification contributed to 75% of all strokes; for aortic arch and extracranial carotid artery calcification this incidence was only 45% and 25%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our findings establish intracranial atherosclerosis as a major risk factor for stroke in the general white population and suggest that its contribution to the proportion of all strokes may be greater than that of large-artery atherosclerosis in more proximally located vessel beds.",Aged Carotid Artery Diseases/*diagnosis/*ethnology Cohort Studies European Continental Ancestry Group/*ethnology Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Intracranial Arteriosclerosis/*diagnosis/*ethnology Male Middle Aged Netherlands/ethnology *Population Surveillance/methods Prospective Studies Risk Factors Stroke
23423413,Association of hydroxyethyl starch administration with mortality and acute kidney injury in critically ill patients requiring volume resuscitation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,JAMA,Zarychanski R and Abou-Setta AM and Turgeon AF and Houston BL and McIntyre L and Marshall JC and Fergusson DA,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Hydroxyethyl starch is commonly used for volume resuscitation yet has been associated with serious adverse events, including acute kidney injury and death. Clinical trials of hydroxyethyl starch are conflicting. Moreover, multiple trials from one investigator have been retracted because of scientific misconduct. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association of hydroxyethyl starch use with mortality and acute kidney injury. DATA SOURCES: Randomized controlled trials from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Global Health, HealthStar, Scopus, Web of Science, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (inception to October 2012), reference lists of relevant articles, and gray literature. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently identified randomized controlled trials comparing hydroxyethyl starch with other resuscitation fluids in critically ill patients receiving acute volume resuscitation. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted trial-level data including population characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and funding sources. Risk of bias was assessed using the risk of bias tool; the strength of evidence was adjudicated using the GRADE methodology. RESULTS: We included 38 eligible trials comparing hydroxyethyl starch to crystalloids, albumin, or gelatin. The majority of trials were categorized as having an unclear risk or high risk of bias. For the 10,880 patients in studies contributing mortality data, the risk ratio (RR) for death among patients randomized to receive hydroxyethyl starch was 1.07 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.14; I2, 0%; absolute risk [AR], 1.20%; 95% CI, -0.26% to 2.66%). This summary effect measure included results from 7 trials performed by an investigator whose subsequent research had been retracted because of scientific misconduct. When we excluded these 7 trials that involved 590 patients, hydroxyethyl starch was found to be associated with increased mortality among 10,290 patients (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.17; I2, 0%; AR, 1.51%; 95% CI, 0.02% to 3.00%), increased renal failure among 8725 patients (RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.47; I2, 26%; AR, 5.45%; 95% CI, 0.44% to 10.47%), and increased use of renal replacement therapy among 9258 patients (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.50; I2, 0%; AR, 3.12%; 95% CI, 0.47% to 5.78%). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In critically ill patients requiring acute volume resuscitation, use of hydroxyethyl starch compared with other resuscitation solutions was not associated with a decrease in mortality. Moreover, after exclusion of 7 trials performed by an investigator whose research has been retracted because of scientific misconduct, hydroxyethyl starch was associated with a significant increased risk of mortality and acute kidney injury.

24395432,Alcohol as a modifiable lifestyle factor affecting multiple sclerosis risk.,JAMA Neurol,Hedstrom AK and Hillert J and Olsson T and Alfredsson L,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Alcohol consumption may be a modifiable lifestyle factor that affects the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Results of previous studies have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible association of alcohol consumption with the risk of developing MS and to relate the influence of alcohol to the effect of smoking. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This report is based on 2 case-control studies: Epidemiological Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis (EIMS) included 745 cases and 1761 controls recruited from April 2005 to June 2011, and Genes and Environment in Multiple Sclerosis (GEMS) recruited 5874 cases and 5246 controls between November 2009 and November 2011. All cases fulfilled the McDonald criteria. Both EIMS and GEMS are population-based studies of the Swedish population aged 16 to 70 years. In EIMS, incident cases of MS were recruited via 40 study centers, including all university hospitals in Sweden. In GEMS, prevalent cases were identified from the Swedish national MS registry. In both studies, controls were randomly selected from the national population register, matched by age, sex, and residential area at the time of disease onset. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Multiple sclerosis status. RESULTS: There was a dose-dependent inverse association between alcohol consumption and risk of developing MS that was statistically significant in both sexes. In EIMS, women who reported high alcohol consumption had an odds ratio (OR) of 0.6 (95% CI, 0.4-1.0) of developing MS compared with nondrinking women, whereas men with high alcohol consumption had an OR of 0.5 (95% CI, 0.2-1.0) compared with nondrinking men. The OR for the comparison in GEMS was 0.7 (95% CI, 0.6-0.9) for women and 0.7 (95% CI, 0.2-0.9) for men. In both studies, the detrimental effect of smoking was more pronounced among nondrinkers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE; Alcohol consumption exhibits a dose-dependent inverse association with MS. Furthermore, alcohol consumption is associated with attenuation of the effect of smoking. Our findings may have relevance for clinical practice because they give no support for advising patients with MS to completely refrain from alcohol.","Adolescent Adult Aged Alcohol Drinking/*epidemiology Case-Control Studies Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Female Humans Life Style Male Middle Aged Multiple Sclerosis/*epidemiology *Registries Risk Smoking/epidemiology Sweden/epidemiology Young Adult"

A novel vaccine candidate (V710) containing the highly conserved S. aureus iron surface determinant B is immunogenic and generally well tolerated in volunteers. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative vaccination in preventing serious postoperative S. aureus infection in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Double-blind, randomized, event-driven trial conducted between December 2007 and August 2011 among 8031 patients aged 18 years or older who were scheduled for full median sternotomy within 14 to 60 days of vaccination at 165 sites in 26 countries. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single 0.5-mL intramuscular injection of either V710 vaccine, 60 mug (n = 4015), or placebo (n = 4016). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy end point was prevention of S. aureus bacteremia and/or deep sternal wound infection (including mediastinitis) through postoperative day 90. Secondary end points included all S. aureus surgical site and invasive infections through postoperative day 90. Three interim analyses with futility assessments were planned. RESULTS: The independent data monitoring committee recommended termination of the study after the second interim analysis because of safety concerns and low efficacy. At the end of the study, the V710 vaccine was not significantly more efficacious than placebo in preventing either the primary end points (22/3528 V710 vaccine recipients [2.6 per 100 person-years] vs 27/3517 placebo recipients [3.2 per 100 person-years]; relative risk, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.44-1.48; P = .58) or secondary end points despite eliciting robust antibody responses. Compared with placebo, the V710 vaccine was associated with more adverse experiences during the first 14 days after vaccination (1219/3958 vaccine recipients [30.8%; 95% CI, 29.4%-32.3%] and 866/3967 placebo recipients [21.8%; 95% CI, 20.6%-23.1%], including 797 [20.1%; 95% CI, 18.9%-21.4%] and 378 [9.5%; 95% CI, 8.6%-10.5%] with injection site reactions and 66 [1.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-2.1%] and 51 [1.3%; 95% CI, 1.0%-1.7%] with serious adverse events, respectively) and a significantly higher rate of multiorgan failure during the entire study (31 vs 17 events; 0.9 [95% CI, 0.6-1.2] vs 0.5 [95% CI, 0.3-0.8] events per 100 person-years; P = .04). Although the overall incidence of vaccine-related serious adverse events (1 in each group) and the all-cause mortality rate (201/3958 vs 177/3967; 5.7 [95% CI, 4.9-6.5] vs 5.0 [95% CI, 4.3-5.7] deaths per 100 person-years; P = .20) were not statistically different between groups, the mortality rate in patients with staphylococcal infections was significantly higher among V710 vaccine than placebo recipients (15/73 vs 4/96; 23.0 [95% CI, 12.9-37.9] vs 4.2 [95% CI, 1.2-10.8] per 100 person-years; difference, 18.8 [95% CI, 8.0-34.1] per 100 person-years). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery with median sternotomy, the use of a vaccine against S. aureus compared with placebo did not reduce the rate of serious postoperative S. aureus infections and was associated with increased mortality among patients who developed S. aureus infections. These findings do not support the use of the V710 vaccine for patients undergoing surgical interventions.

24026579,Overt irritability/anger in unipolar major depressive episodes: past and current characteristics and implications for long-term course.,JAMA Psychiatry,Judd LL and Schettler PJ and Coryell W and Akiskal HS and Fiedorowicz JG,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Although symptoms of irritability or anger are not central to the diagnosis of unipolar major depressive episodes (MDEs), these symptoms have been found, in cross-sectional studies, to be highly prevalent and associated with increased comorbidity and depressive illness burden. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of overtly expressed irritability/anger and its effect on intake presentation and the long-term course of illness. DESIGN: A prospective, naturalistic investigation of patients with unipolar MDEs, studied systematically at intake and during up to 31 years of follow-up. SETTING: Five US academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Patients entered the National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative Depression Study during an MDE in 1978, 1979, 1980, or 1981. Patients with unipolar MDE at intake (n = 536) were divided into those with and those without current comorbid overtly expressed irritability/anger. EXPOSURE: In this observational, longitudinal study, patients received treatment that was recorded but not controlled. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Groups were compared on illness severity and chronicity, psychosocial impairment, quality of life, suicidal behavior, lifetime comorbid diagnoses, impulse control, and measures associated with bipolarity. RESULTS: Overt irritability/anger was present in 292 of 536 participants with a unipolar MDE at study intake (54.5%). It was associated with significantly increased depressive severity, longer duration of the index MDE, poorer impulse control, a more chronic and severe long-term course of illness, higher rates of lifetime comorbid substance abuse and anxiety disorder, more antisocial personality disorders, greater psychosocial impairment before intake and during follow-up, reduced life satisfaction, and a higher rate of bipolar II disorder in relatives. No association was found with increased suicidal ideation or behavior. Results were not explained by comorbidity or other manic spectrum symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study extends results of cross-sectional investigations and indicates that irritability/anger during MDEs is a highly prevalent clinical marker of a more severe, chronic, and complex depressive illness.

DESIGN: Case-control diagnostic accuracy study. SETTING: Academic dermatology department. PARTICIPANTS AND MATERIALS: Digital clinical images of pigmented cutaneous lesions (60 melanoma and 128 benign control lesions) with a histologic diagnosis rendered by a board-certified dermatopathologist, obtained before biopsy from patients undergoing lesion removal as a part of routine care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 4 smartphone applications designed to aid nonclinician users in determining whether their skin lesion is benign or malignant. RESULTS: Sensitivity of the 4 tested applications ranged from 6.8% to 98.1%; specificity, 30.4% to 93.7%; positive predictive value, 33.3% to 42.1%; and negative predictive value, 65.4% to 97.0%. The highest sensitivity for melanoma diagnosis was observed for an application that sends the image directly to a board-certified dermatologist for analysis; the lowest, for applications that use automated algorithms to analyze images. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of smartphone applications in assessing melanoma risk is highly variable, and 3 of 4 smartphone applications incorrectly classified 30% or more of melanomas as unconcerning. Reliance on these applications, which are not subject to regulatory oversight, in lieu of medical consultation can delay the diagnosis of melanoma and harm users.","Algorithms *Cellular Phone *Computers, Handheld Dermoscopy Diagnosis, Differential *Diagnostic Errors Electronic Mail Humans Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/methods Melanoma/*diagnosis ROC Curve Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis *Software Telemedicine/*instrumentation User-Computer Interface Video Recording/methods"

23348366,Anatomic predictors of unsatisfactory outcomes in surgical rejuvenation of the midface.,JAMA Facial Plast Surg,Jacono AA and Ransom ER,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To aid the aesthetic surgeon in midface analysis and selection of treatment plans offering the greatest likelihood of success in midface rejuvenation. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients who underwent surgical midface rejuvenation by a single surgeon. We recorded demographics, history, procedures, outcomes, and complications. Results of physical examination and photography were used to classify patients by volume loss, midface ptosis, skin elasticity, and skeletal anatomy. Outcome was determined by patient satisfaction at the 12-month follow-up; unsatisfactory results were further analyzed by a blinded independent expert with more than 15 years' experience. RESULTS: We included 150 patients. Mean patient age was 51 years; 93.3% were women, and 20.7% had undergone previous procedures, including malar implants, autologous fat grafting, rhytidectomy, midface-lift, and extended lower blepharoplasty. Multimodality treatment was used in 34.0%. Patient dissatisfaction was encountered in 14.0% of cases; the expert concurred in each case. Autologous fat grafting alone demonstrated the greatest propensity for dissatisfaction (4 of 12 cases [33%]). Rate of dissatisfaction was significantly higher with malar hypoplasia (41% vs 7%; P < .001) or loss of elasticity (16% vs 3%; P = .01) but was not highly correlated with age (r = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Successful midface rejuvenation requires accurate diagnosis and avoidance of anatomic pitfalls. Many patients require multimodality therapy, including lifting and volumizing techniques. Unsatisfactory results are most common when midfacial aging is accompanied by skeletal insufficiency or loss of elasticity. Respective consideration of these defects should be given to placement of malar implants and rhytidectomy approaches targeting the midface.",Adult Aged Blepharoplasty/methods Endoscopy/methods Esthetics Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Middle Aged Patient Satisfaction *Rejuvenation Reoperation Retrospective Studies Rhytidoplasty/*methods
23712681,Relationship between the prognostic expectations of seriously ill patients undergoing hemodialysis and their nephrologists.,JAMA Intern Med,Wachterman MW and Marcantonio ER and Davis RB and Cohen RA and Waikar SS and Phillips RS and McCarthy EP,va,"IMPORTANCE: Patients undergoing hemodialysis have an annual mortality rate exceeding 20%, comparable to many types of cancer. Past research has shown that patients with cancer overestimate their likelihood of survival relative to their physicians, but this relationship has not been examined in patients with noncancer diagnoses. Perceptions of prognosis and transplant candidacy may influence goals of care. OBJECTIVES: To compare the perceptions of hemodialysis patients and their nephrologists concerning prognosis and the likelihood of transplant; to follow actual survival; and to explore the relationship between patients' expectations and their goals of care. DESIGN: We completed a medical record abstraction to estimate 1-year mortality risk among patients who underwent dialysis at any time from November 1, 2010, through September 1, 2011. We then conducted in-person interviews with eligible patients whose predicted 1-year mortality, based on validated prognostic tools, was at least 20%. We also interviewed their nephrologists. We compared patients' and physicians' expectations about 1- and 5-year survival and transplant candidacy and measured the association between patients' expectations and goals of care. We then followed actual survival using Kaplan-Meier methods. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Two dialysis units in Boston. Two hundred seven patients undergoing hemodialysis included in the medical record review, with 62 eligible patients interviewed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Predicted 1-year mortality risk using validated prognostic tools; actual survival; patients' and physicians' expectations about 1-year survival and likelihood of transplant; and patients' goals of care. RESULTS: Of the 207 hemodialysis patients, 72.5% had a predicted 1-year mortality of at least 20%. Of the 80 patients eligible for interview, 62 participated (response rate, 78%). Patients were significantly more optimistic than their nephrologists about 1- and 5-year survival (P < .001 for both) and were more likely to think they were transplant candidates (37 [66%] vs 22 [39%] [P = .008]). Of the 81% of patients reporting a 90% chance or greater of being alive at 1 year, 18 (44%) preferred care focused on extending life, even if it meant more discomfort, compared with 1 (9%) among patients reporting a lower chance of survival (P = .045). Actual survival was 93% at 1 year but decreased to 79% by 17 months and 56% by 23 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hemodialysis patients are more optimistic about prognosis and transplant candidacy than their nephrologists. In our sample, patients' expectations about 1-year survival were more accurate than those of their nephrologists, but their longer-term survival expectations dramatically overestimated even their 2-year survival rates. Patients' prognostic expectations are associated with their treatment preferences. Our findings suggest the need for interventions to help providers communicate effectively with patients about prognosis.","Academic Medical Centers Boston/epidemiology Hemodialysis Units, Hospital Humans Kidney Failure, Chronic/mortality/*psychology/therapy Kidney Transplantation/*psychology *Nephrology Physicians/*psychology Prognosis Questionnaires Renal Dialysis/mortality/*psychology Research Design Risk Assessment Risk Factors Survival Rate"

We conducted a qualitative analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial that demonstrated improved quality of life, mood, and survival in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who received early PC integrated with standard oncologic care vs standard oncologic care alone. Our objectives were to (1) identify key elements of early PC clinic visits, (2) explore the timing of key elements, and (3) compare the content of PC and oncologic visit notes at the critical time points of clinical deterioration and radiographic disease progression. METHODS We randomly selected 20 patients who received early PC and survived within 4 periods: less than 3 months (n = 5), 3 to 6 months (n = 5), 6 to 12 months (n = 5), and 12 to 24 months (n = 5). We performed content analysis on PC and oncologic visit notes from the electronic health records of these patients. RESULTS Addressing symptoms and coping were the most prevalent components of the PC clinic visits. Initial visits focused on building relationships and rapport with patients and their families and on illness understanding, including prognostic awareness. Discussions about resuscitation preferences and hospice predominantly occurred during later visits. Comparing PC and oncologic care visits around critical time points, both included discussions about symptoms and illness status; however, PC visits emphasized psychosocial elements, such as coping, whereas oncologic care visits focused on cancer treatment and management of medical complications. CONCLUSIONS Early PC clinic visits emphasize managing symptoms, strengthening coping, and cultivating illness understanding and prognostic awareness in a responsive and time-sensitive model. During critical clinical time points, PC and oncologic care visits have distinct features that suggest a key role for PC involvement and enable oncologists to focus on cancer treatment and managing medical complications.","*Adaptation, Psychological Aged Aged, 80 and over Ambulatory Care/organization & administration/*psychology Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*psychology/secondary/therapy Female Humans Lung Neoplasms/pathology/*psychology/therapy Male Middle Aged Palliative Care/*methods/psychology Qualitative Research Quality of Life Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Time Factors"

23329309,Driving with central field loss I: effect of central scotomas on responses to hazards.,JAMA Ophthalmol,Bronstad PM and Bowers AR and Albu A and Goldstein R and Peli E,harvard,"OBJECTIVES: To determine how central field loss (CFL) affects reaction time to pedestrians and to test the hypothesis that scotomas lateral to the preferred retinal locus will delay detection of hazards approaching from that side. METHODS: Participants with binocular CFL (scotoma diameter, 7 degrees -25 degrees ; visual acuity, 0.3-1.0 logMAR) using lateral preferred retinal fixation loci and matched controls with normal vision drove in a simulator for approximately 1(1/2) hours per session for 2 sessions a week apart. Participants responded to frequent virtual pedestrians who appeared on either the left or right sides and approached the participant's lane on a collision trajectory that, therefore, caused them to remain in approximately the same area of the visual field. RESULTS: The study included 11 individuals with CFL and 11 controls with normal vision. The CFL participants had more detection failures for pedestrians who appeared in areas of visual field loss than did controls in corresponding areas (6.4% vs 0.2%). Furthermore, the CFL participants reacted more slowly to pedestrians in blind than nonscotomatous areas (4.28 vs 2.43 seconds, P < .001) and overall had more late and missed responses than controls (29% vs 3%, P < .001). Scotoma size and contrast sensitivity predicted outcomes in blind and seeing areas, respectively. Visual acuity was not correlated with response measures. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to causing visual acuity and contrast sensitivity loss, the central scotoma per se delayed hazard detection even though small eye movements could potentially compensate for the loss. Responses in nonscotomatous areas were also delayed, although to a lesser extent, possibly because of the eccentricity of fixation. Our findings will help practitioners advise patients with CFL about specific difficulties they may face when driving.","*Accidents, Traffic Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over *Automobile Driving Computer Simulation Contrast Sensitivity/physiology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Reaction Time/*physiology Scotoma/*physiopathology Vision, Binocular/physiology Vision, Low/*physiopathology Visual Acuity/physiology Visual Field Tests Visual Fields/*physiology Visual Perception"
23307209,Radiation-related cancer risk associated with surveillance imaging for metastasis from choroidal melanoma.,JAMA Ophthalmol,Wen JC and Sai V and Straatsma BR and McCannel TA,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the lifetime attributable risk of cancer associated with whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and with CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis if performed at various frequencies and for different durations for surveillance of patients with primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma for distant metastasis. METHODS: Effective radiation doses for whole-body CT and for CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were calculated using Monte Carlo simulation studies. The effective dose of the PET scan was estimated by multiplying fludeoxyglucose F18 radioactivity with dose coefficients. Lifetime attributable risks of cancer were calculated using the approach described in the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII report. RESULTS: For a 50-year-old patient, an annual CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis for 10 years carries an estimated lifetime attributable risk of cancer of 0.9% for male patients and 1.3% for female patients, whereas an annual PET/CT each year for 10 years carries an estimated lifetime attributable risk of cancer of 1.6% for male patients and 1.9% for female patients. Lifetime risk was found to be higher in younger, female patients. The lifetime attributable risk of cancer was estimated to be as high as 7.9% for a 20-year-old female patient receiving a PET/CT scan every 6 months for 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive surveillance protocols incorporating CT scanning or PET/CT scanning for detection of metastasis from primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma appear to confer a significant substantial risk of a secondary malignant tumor in patients who do not succumb to metastatic melanoma within the first few posttreatment years.","Adult Aged Body Burden Choroid Neoplasms/pathology/*radionuclide imaging Epidemiological Monitoring Female Fluorodeoxyglucose F18/diagnostic use Humans Liver Neoplasms/*radionuclide imaging/secondary Male Melanoma/*radionuclide imaging/secondary Middle Aged Monte Carlo Method Multimodal Imaging/*adverse effects Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology *Positron-Emission Tomography Radiation Dosage Radiometry/methods Radiopharmaceuticals/diagnostic use Risk Assessment Risk Factors Tomography, X-Ray Computed/adverse effects Whole Body Imaging Whole-Body Irradiation Young Adult"

SETTING: Academic tertiary care center. DESIGN: Retrospective medical chart review. METHODS: With approval of the institutional review board, hospital records were reviewed for children diagnosed as having hearing loss. We identified 923 children with hearing loss from 2001 to 2011. Patients who passed the NHS with subsequent hearing loss were included. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients were included in our study. The suspicion of hearing loss in patients who passed the NHS was most often from parental concerns (n = 28 [36%]) and failed school hearing screens (n = 25 [32%]). Speech and language delay and failed primary care physician screens accounted for 17% and 12%, respectively. Configuration of the audiogram was bilateral symmetric (n = 42 [54%]), bilateral asymmetric (n = 16 [21%]), and unilateral (n = 20 [26%]) loss. Thirty-seven patients (47%) had severe or profound hearing loss. The etiology was unknown in 42 patients (54%); the remaining was attributed to genetics (n = 13 [17%]), anatomic abnormality (n = 11 [14%]), acquired perinatal (n = 9 [12%]), and auditory neuropathy (n = 3 [4%]). CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study to characterize children with hearing loss who passed the NHS. In our review, parental concerns and school hearing screens were the most common method to diagnose hearing loss after passing the NHS. Families and primary care physicians may have a false sense of security when patients pass the NHS and overlook symptoms of hearing loss. This study raises the question whether further screens would identify hearing loss in children after passing the NHS.","Child Child, Preschool Female Hearing Loss, Bilateral/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology Hearing Loss, Sensorineural/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology Hearing Tests Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Language Development Disorders/epidemiology Male *Neonatal Screening Parents Pennsylvania/epidemiology Primary Health Care Retrospective Studies School Health Services Severity of Illness Index"

DESIGN Retrospective matched cohort study. SETTING Eight managed care organizations of the Vaccine Safety Datalink. PARTICIPANTS Children born between 2004 and 2008. MAIN EXPOSURE Immunization records were used to calculate the average number of days undervaccinated. Two matched cohorts were created: 1 with children who were undervaccinated for any reason and 1 with children who were undervaccinated because of parental choice. For both cohorts, undervaccinated children were matched to age-appropriately vaccinated children by birth date, managed care organization, and sex. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Rates of undervaccination, specific patterns of undervaccination, and health care utilization rates. RESULTS Of 323 247 children born between 2004 and 2008, 48.7% were undervaccinated for at least 1 day before age 24 months. The prevalence of undervaccination and specific patterns of undervaccination increased over time (P &lt; .001). In a matched cohort analysis, undervaccinated children had lower outpatient visit rates compared with children who were age-appropriately vaccinated (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.89- 0.90). In contrast, undervaccinated children had increased inpatient admission rates compared with age-appropriately vaccinated children (IRR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.18-1.23). In a second matched cohort analysis, children who were undervaccinated because of parental choice had lower rates of outpatient visits (IRR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.93-0.95) and emergency department encounters (IRR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.94) than age-appropriately vaccinated children.

DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Clinical Trials, and bibliography of retrieved articles through August 11, 2012. STUDY SELECTION Randomized trials of headache treatment among children and adolescents (&lt;18 years old). INTERVENTION Any placebo-controlled trial or comparisons between 2 or more active medications. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Number of headaches per month. RESULTS Among 21 included trials, there were 13 placebo-controlled and 10 active comparator trials (2 also included placebo). Twenty trials focused on episodic migraines and 1 on chronic daily headaches. Drugs more effective than placebo for episodic migraines (&lt;15 headaches per month) included topiramate (difference in headaches per month, -0.71; 95% CI, -1.19 to -0.24) and trazodone (-0.60; 95% CI, -1.09 to -0.11). Ineffective drugs included clonidine, flunarizine, pizotifen, propranolol, and valproate. A single trial of fluoxetine for chronic daily headaches found it ineffective. Patients given placebo experienced a significant (P = .03) decline in headaches, from 5.6 (95% CI, 4.52-6.77; Q = 8.14 [Cochran Q is a measure of the heterogeneity of the included studies]) to 2.9 headaches per month (95% CI, 1.66-4.08; Q = 4.72). Among the 10 active comparator trials, flunarizine was more effective than piracetam (difference in headaches per month, -2.20; 95% CI, -3.93 to -0.47) but no better than aspirin, dihydroergotamine, or propranolol. Propranolol was compared with valproate as well as behavioral treatment, and 2 studies compared different doses of topiramate; none of these trials showed significant differences. CONCLUSIONS Topiramate and trazodone have limited evidence supporting efficacy for episodic migraines. Placebo was effective in reducing headaches. Other commonly used drugs have no evidence supporting their use in children and adolescents.

Recommendations for school-aged children include 60 minutes of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and no more than 2 hours per day of screen-time viewing. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Data from the 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a representative sample of the US population. PARTICIPANTS Analysis included 1218 children 6 to 11 years of age. MAIN EXPOSURES Age, race/ethnicity, sex, income, family structure, and obesity status. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Proxy-reported adherence to physical activity and screen-time recommendations, separately and concurrently. RESULTS Based on proxy reports, overall, 70% of children met physical activity recommendations, and 54% met screen-time viewing recommendations. Although Hispanics were less likely to meet physical activity recommendations (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.60 [95% CI, 0.38-0.95]), they were more likely to meet screen-time recommendations compared with non-Hispanic whites (aOR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.18-2.43]). Only 38% met both recommendations concurrently. Age (9-11 years vs 6-8 years: aOR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.38-0.85]) and obesity (aOR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.38-0.73]) were inversely associated with concurrent adherence to both recommendations. CONCLUSIONS Fewer than 4 in 10 children met both physical activity and screen-time recommendations concurrently. The prevalence of sedentary behavior was higher in older children.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the lifetime prevalence of suicidal behaviors among US adolescents and the associations of retrospectively reported, temporally primary DSM-IV disorders with the subsequent onset of suicidal behaviors. DESIGN: Dual-frame national sample of adolescents from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement. SETTING: Face-to-face household interviews with adolescents and questionnaires for parents. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6483 adolescents 13 to 18 years of age and their parents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime suicide ideation, plans, and attempts. RESULTS: The estimated lifetime prevalences of suicide ideation, plans, and attempts among the respondents are 12.1%, 4.0%, and 4.1%, respectively. The vast majority of adolescents with these behaviors meet lifetime criteria for at least one DSM-IV mental disorder assessed in the survey. Most temporally primary (based on retrospective age-of-onset reports) fear/anger, distress, disruptive behavior, and substance disorders significantly predict elevated odds of subsequent suicidal behaviors in bivariate models. The most consistently significant associations of these disorders are with suicide ideation, although a number of disorders are also predictors of plans and both planned and unplanned attempts among ideators. Most suicidal adolescents (>80%) receive some form of mental health treatment. In most cases (>55%), treatment starts prior to onset of suicidal behaviors but fails to prevent these behaviors from occurring. CONCLUSIONS: Suicidal behaviors are common among US adolescents, with rates that approach those of adults. The vast majority of youth with suicidal behaviors have preexisting mental disorders. The disorders most powerfully predicting ideation, though, are different from those most powerfully predicting conditional transitions from ideation to plans and attempts. These differences suggest that distinct prediction and prevention strategies are needed for ideation, plans among ideators, planned attempts, and unplanned attempts.","Adolescent Adolescent Behavior African Americans/psychology/statistics & numerical data Age of Onset Educational Status Ethnic Groups/psychology/statistics & numerical data European Continental Ancestry Group/psychology/statistics & numerical data Female Hispanic Americans/psychology/statistics & numerical data Humans Male Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/therapy Prevalence Sex Factors *Suicidal Ideation Suicide/*statistics & numerical data Suicide, Attempted/*statistics & numerical data United States/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVES: To report 24-month outcomes of the Teacher-Delivered Personality-Targeted Interventions for Substance Misuse Trial (Adventure trial) in which school staff were trained to provide interventions to students with 1 of 4 high-risk (HR) profiles: anxiety sensitivity, hopelessness, impulsivity, and sensation seeking and to examine the indirect herd effects of this program on the broader low-risk (LR) population of students who were not selected for intervention. DESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Secondary schools in London, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1210 HR and 1433 LR students in the ninth grade (mean [SD] age, 13.7 [0.33] years). INTERVENTION: Schools were randomized to provide brief personality-targeted interventions to HR youth or treatment as usual (statutory drug education in class). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were assessed for drinking, binge drinking, and problem drinking before randomization and at 6-monthly intervals for 2 years. RESULTS: Two-part latent growth models indicated long-term effects of the intervention on drinking rates (beta = -0.320, SE = 0.145, P = .03) and binge drinking rates (beta = -0.400, SE = 0.179, P = .03) and growth in binge drinking (beta = -0.716, SE = 0.274, P = .009) and problem drinking (beta = -0.452, SE = 0.193, P = .02) for HR youth. The HR youth were also found to benefit from the interventions during the 24-month follow-up on drinking quantity (beta = -0.098, SE = 0.047, P = .04), growth in drinking quantity (beta = -0.176, SE = 0.073, P = .02), and growth in binge drinking frequency (beta = -0.183, SE = 0.092, P = .047). Some herd effects in LR youth were observed, specifically on drinking rates (beta = -0.259, SE = 0.132, P = .049) and growth of binge drinking (beta = -0.244, SE = 0.073, P = .001), during the 24-month follow-up.

However, it is unclear whether these deficits become more severe during adolescence. OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of cognitive developmental trajectories in adolescence and young adulthood on the risk for psychosis in adulthood. DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Academic research. POPULATION-BASED COHORTS: Four population-based cohorts of adolescent boys and young men born in Sweden in 1953, 1967, 1972, and 1977, totaling 10,717 individuals, and followed up through December 31, 2006. EXPOSURE: Scores on tests of verbal, spatial, and inductive ability at age 13 years and in equivalent tests at army conscription (age 18 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hospital admissions for nonaffective or affective psychoses in adulthood. RESULTS: A relative decline (compared with the unaffected population) in verbal ability between ages 13 and 18 years was associated with increased risk for schizophrenia and for other nonaffective and affective psychoses (adjusted hazard ratio for schizophrenia for an increase of 1 SD in verbal ability, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.88; P = .009). Decline between ages 13 and 18 years was a much stronger predictor of psychosis than the verbal ability score at age 18 years alone. The association remained significant after adjustment for urbanicity, parental educational level, and family history of psychosis and persisted when cases with onset before age 25 years were excluded, indicating that this was not a prodromal effect. CONCLUSIONS: A relative decline in cognitive performance in adolescence and young adulthood, particularly in verbal ability, is associated with increased risk for psychosis in adulthood, and a relative decline in verbal ability between ages 13 and 18 years is a stronger predictor of psychosis than verbal ability at age 18 years alone. This suggests an impairment of late neurodevelopment affecting the acquisition of verbal skills in adolescent boys and young men who later develop psychosis.",Adolescent Adolescent Development Adult Brain/growth & development Cognition Disorders/*epidemiology Cohort Studies Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Prodromal Symptoms Psychotic Disorders/*epidemiology Risk Factors Schizophrenia/*epidemiology Sweden/epidemiology

DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING: Eleven university-based general surgery residency programs from July 2011 to May 2012. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirteen surgical interns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perceptions of the impact of the new duty hours on various aspects of surgical training, including the 6 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies, were measured on 3-point scales. Quality of life, burnout, balance between personal and professional life, and career satisfaction were measured using validated instruments. RESULTS: Half of all interns felt that the duty hour changes have decreased the coordination of patient care (53%), their ability to achieve continuity with hospitalized patients (70%), and their time spent in the operating room (57%). Less than half (44%) of interns believed that the new standards have decreased resident fatigue. In longitudinal analysis, residents' beliefs had significantly changed in 2 categories: less likely to believe that practice-based learning and improvement had improved and more likely to report no change to resident fatigue (P < .01, chi2 tests). The majority (82%) of residents reported a neutral or good overall quality of life. Compared with the normal US population, 50 interns (32%) were 0.5 SD less than the mean on the 8-item Short Form Health Survey mental quality of life score. Approximately one-third of interns demonstrated weekly symptoms of emotional exhaustion (28%) or depersonalization (28%) or reported that their personal-professional balance was either ""very poor"" or ""not great"" (32%). Although many interns (67%) reported that they daily or weekly reflect on their satisfaction from being a surgeon, 1 in 7 considered giving up their career as a surgeon on at least a weekly basis. CONCLUSIONS: The first cohort of surgical interns to train under the new regulations report decreased continuity with patients, coordination of patient care, and time spent in the operating room. Furthermore, suboptimal quality of life, burnout, and thoughts of giving up surgery were common, even under the new paradigm of reduced work hours.","Accreditation Adult Attitude of Health Personnel *Burnout, Professional Clinical Competence *Education, Medical, Graduate Female General Surgery/*education Humans *Internship and Residency Longitudinal Studies Male *Personnel Staffing and Scheduling *Quality of Life United States Work Schedule Tolerance Workload"

23917291,History of kidney stones and the risk of coronary heart disease.,JAMA,Ferraro PM and Taylor EN and Eisner BH and Gambaro G and Rimm EB and Mukamal KJ and Curhan GC,harvard,"IMPORTANCE: Kidney stone disease is common and may be associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Previous studies of the association between kidney stones and CHD have often not controlled for important risk factors, and the results have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between a history of kidney stones and the risk of CHD in 3 large prospective cohorts. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective study of 45,748 men and 196,357 women in the United States without a history of CHD at baseline who were participants in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) (45,748 men aged 40-75 years; follow-up from 1986 to 2010), Nurses' Health Study I (NHS I) (90,235 women aged 30-55 years; follow-up from 1992 to 2010), and Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II) (106,122 women aged 25-42 years; follow-up from 1991 to 2009). The diagnoses of kidney stones and CHD were updated biennially during follow-up. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Coronary heart disease was defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary revascularization. The outcome was identified by biennial questionnaires and confirmed through review of medical records. RESULTS Of a total of 242,105 participants, 19,678 reported a history of kidney stones. After up to 24 years of follow-up in men and 18 years in women, 16,838 incident cases of CHD occurred. After adjusting for potential confounders, among women, those with a reported history of kidney stones had an increased risk of CHD than those without a history of kidney stones in NHS I (incidence rate [IR], 754 vs 514 per 100,000 person-years; multivariable hazard ratio [HR], 1.18 [95% CI, 1.08-1.28]) and NHS II (IR, 144 vs 55 per 100,000 person-years; multivariable HR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.23-1.78]). There was no significant association in men (IR, 1355 vs 1022 per 100,000 person-years; multivariable HR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.99-1.13]). Similar results were found when analyzing the individual end points (fatal and nonfatal MI and revascularization). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among the 2 cohorts of women, a history of kidney stones was associated with a modest but statistically significantly increased risk of CHD; there was no significant association in a separate cohort of men.

24500799,Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in patients with preexisting gastroesophageal reflux disease : a national analysis.,JAMA Surg,DuPree CE and Blair K and Steele SR and Martin MJ,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze the effect of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and to compare the results of LSG vs gastric bypass (GB) among patients with known GERD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We performed a retrospective review of the Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2010, including inpatient and all outpatient follow-up data. We compared patients undergoing LSG with a concurrent cohort undergoing GB. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of improvement or worsening of GERD symptoms, development of new-onset GERD, and weight loss and complications. RESULTS: A total of 4832 patients underwent LSG and 33 867 underwent GB, with preexisting GERD present in 44.5% of the LSG cohort and 50.4% of the GB cohort. Most LSG patients (84.1%) continued to have GERD symptoms postoperatively, with only 15.9% demonstrating GERD resolution. Of LSG patients who did not demonstrate preoperative GERD, 8.6% developed GERD postoperatively. In comparison, GB resolved GERD in most patients (62.8%) within 6 months postoperatively (P < .001). Among the LSG cohort, the presence of preoperative GERD was associated with increased postoperative complications (15.1% vs 10.6%), gastrointestinal adverse events (6.9% vs 3.6%), and increased need for revisional surgery (0.6% vs 0.3%) (all P < .05). The presence of GERD had no effect on weight loss for the GB cohort but was associated with decreased weight loss in the LSG group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy did not reliably relieve or improve GERD symptoms and induced GERD in some previously asymptomatic patients. Preoperative GERD was associated with worse outcomes and decreased weight loss with LSG and may represent a relative contraindication.","Female Follow-Up Studies Gastrectomy/*methods Gastroesophageal Reflux/*complications/epidemiology/surgery Gastroplasty/*methods Humans Incidence Laparoscopy/*methods Male Middle Aged Obesity, Morbid/complications/epidemiology/*surgery *Population Surveillance Retrospective Studies Time Factors Treatment Outcome Washington/epidemiology Weight Loss/physiology"

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of laparoscopic compared with open ventral hernia repair (VHR) in obese patients. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: Nationwide hospital survey. PARTICIPANTS: Obese patients undergoing VHR from 2008 through 2009 were selected from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Data analysis included intraoperative and postoperative complications, length of stay, and total hospital charges. Additional patient demographics, including insurance, median income, and locations, were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 47,661 obese patients who underwent VHR during the study period, laparoscopic VHR increased more than 4-fold, from 1547 of 23,917 (6.5%) to 6629 of 23,704 (28.0%) (P < .001). Laparoscopic VHR was associated with a lower overall complication rate (6.3% vs 13.7%; P < .001), shorter median length of stay (3 vs 4 days; P < .001), and lower mean total hospital charges ($40,387 vs $48,513; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified a predictive variable for laparoscopic VHR: private insurance (odds ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15-1.27; P < .001). Ventral hernias with a gangrenous bowel were less likely to undergo laparoscopic VHR (odds ratio, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.06-0.34; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the era of laparoscopy, the overall use of laparoscopic VHR in obese patients has increased significantly and appears to be safe, with a shorter stay and a lower cost of care.","Adult Aged Female Hernia, Ventral/*complications/*surgery *Herniorrhaphy Hospitalization Humans *Laparoscopy Male Middle Aged Obesity/*complications Retrospective Studies Socioeconomic Factors Treatment Outcome"

DESIGN AND SETTING: A cohort study was conducted in Northern Manhattan, New York, New York. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2160 community-dwelling Medicare recipients aged 65 years or older were included in the study. METHODS: Depression was assessed using the 10-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) and defined by a CES-D score of 4 or more. We used logistic regression for cross-sectional association analyses and proportional hazards regression for longitudinal analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mild cognitive impairment dementia, and progression from MCI to dementia were the main outcome measures. We also used subcategories of MCI (amnestic and nonamnestic), and dementia (probable Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia, including possible Alzheimer disease with stroke). RESULTS: Baseline depression was associated with prevalent MCI (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9) and dementia (2.2; 1.6-3.1). Baseline depression was associated with an increased risk of incident dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3) but not with incident MCI (0.9; 0.7-1.2). Persons with MCI and coexisting depression at baseline had a higher risk of progression to dementia (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.4), especially vascular dementia (4.3; 1.1-17.0), but not Alzheimer disease (1.9; 1.0-3.6). CONCLUSION: The association of depression with prevalent MCI and with progression from MCI to dementia, but not with incident MCI, suggests that depression accompanies cognitive impairment but does not precede it.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies Cross-Sectional Studies Dementia/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology Depression/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology Disease Progression Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Mild Cognitive Impairment/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology Residence Characteristics"
23989797,Lateral wedge insoles as a conservative treatment for pain in patients with medial knee osteoarthritis: a meta-analysis.,JAMA,Parkes MJ and Maricar N and Lunt M and LaValley MP and Jones RK and Segal NA and Takahashi-Narita K and Felson DT,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: There is no consensus regarding the efficacy of lateral wedge insoles as a treatment for pain in medial knee osteoarthritis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether lateral wedge insoles reduce pain in patients with medial knee osteoarthritis compared with an appropriate control. DATA SOURCES: Databases searched include the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, AMED, MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, ScienceDirect, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and BIOSIS from inception to May 2013, with no limits on study date or language. The metaRegister of Controlled Trials and the NHS Evidence website were also searched. STUDY SELECTION: Included were randomized trials comparing shoe-based treatments (lateral heel wedge insoles or shoes with variable stiffness soles) aimed at reducing medial knee load, with a neutral or no wedge control condition in patients with painful medial knee osteoarthritis. Studies must have included patient-reported pain as an outcome. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Trial data were extracted independently by 2 researchers using a standardized form. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool by 2 observers. Eligible studies were pooled using a random-effects approach. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Change in self-reported knee pain at follow-up. RESULTS: Twelve trials met inclusion criteria with a total of 885 participants of whom 502 received lateral wedge treatment. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) suggested a favorable association with lateral wedges compared with control (SMD, -0.47; 95% CI, -0.80 to -0.14); however, substantial heterogeneity was present (I2 = 82.7%). This effect size represents an effect of -2.12 points on the 20-point Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scale. Larger trials with a lower risk of bias suggested a null association. Meta-regression analyses showed that higher effect sizes (unstandardized beta, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.28 to 1.87] for trials using a no treatment control) were seen in trials using a no wedge treatment control group (n = 4 trials; SMD, -1.20 [95% CI, -2.09 to -0.30]) and lower effect sizes (unstandardized beta, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.002 to 0.52] for each bias category deemed low risk) when the study method was deemed at low risk of bias. Among trials in which the control treatment was a neutral insole (n = 7), lateral wedges showed no association (SMD, -0.03 [95% CI, -0.18 to 0.12] on WOMAC; this represents an effect of -0.12 points), and results showed little heterogeneity (I2 = 7.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although meta-analytic pooling of all studies showed a statistically significant association between use of lateral wedges and lower pain in medial knee osteoarthritis, restriction of studies to those using a neutral insole comparator did not show a significant or clinically important association. These findings do not support the use of lateral wedges for this indication.","*Foot Orthoses Humans Osteoarthritis, Knee/complications/*therapy Pain/etiology Pain Management/*methods Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Shoes"

OBJECTIVE: To identify the incidence of medical professional liability claims stemming from cutaneous laser surgery performed by nonphysician operators (NPOs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Search of an online national database of public legal documents involving laser surgery by NPOs. EXPOSURE: Laser surgery by nonphysicians. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Frequency and nature of cases, including year of litigation, certification of provider and operator, type of procedure performed, clinical setting of injury, and cause of legal action. RESULTS: From January 1999, to December 2012, we identified 175 cases related to injury secondary to cutaneous laser surgery. Of these, 75 (42.9%) were cases involving an NPO. From 2008 to 2011, the percentage of cases with NPOs increased from 36.3% to 77.8%. Laser hair removal was the most commonly performed procedure. Despite the fact that approximately only one-third of laser hair removal procedures are performed by NPOs, 75.5% of hair removal lawsuits from 2004 to 2012 were performed by NPOs. From 2008 to 2012, this number increased to 85.7%. Most cases (64.0%) by NPOs were performed outside of a traditional medical setting. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Claims related to cutaneous laser surgery by NPOs, particularly outside of a traditional medical setting, are increasing. Physicians and other laser operators should be aware of their state laws, especially in regard to physician supervision of NPOs.","Allied Health Personnel/*legislation & jurisprudence Beauty Culture/*legislation & jurisprudence Databases, Factual Hair Removal/*adverse effects Humans Intense Pulsed Light Therapy/adverse effects Laser Therapy/*adverse effects *Liability, Legal Physician's Role Physicians/*legislation & jurisprudence Rejuvenation United States"

Studies are needed that evaluate whether sleep variables are associated with neuroimaging evidence of beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition. OBJECTIVE To determine the association between self-reported sleep variables and Abeta deposition in community-dwelling older adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of 70 adults (mean age, 76 [range, 53-91] years) from the neuroimaging substudy of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, a normative aging study. EXPOSURE Self-reported sleep variables. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES beta-Amyloid burden, measured by carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography distribution volume ratios (DVRs). RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, reports of shorter sleep duration were associated with greater Abeta burden, measured by mean cortical DVR (B = 0.08 [95% CI, 0.03-0.14]; P = .005) and precuneus DVR (B = 0.11 [0.03-0.18]; P = .007). Reports of lower sleep quality were associated with greater Abeta burden measured by precuneus DVR (B = 0.08 [0.01-0.15]; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among community-dwelling older adults, reports of shorter sleep duration and poorer sleep quality are associated with greater Abeta burden.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between hours of sleep and the risk for motor vehicle crash, including the time of day of crash and types of crash (single, multiple vehicle, run off road, and intersection). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: New South Wales, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Questionnaire responses were obtained from 20,822 newly licensed drivers aged 17 to 24 years. Participants held a first-stage provisional license between June 2003 and December 2004 prospectively linked to licensing and police-reported crash data, with an average of 2 years of follow-up. Analyses were conducted on a subsample of 19,327 participants for which there was full information. EXPOSURE: Sleeping 6 or fewer hours per night. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome variable was police-reported crash. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to investigate the role of sleep duration on the risk for crash. RESULTS: On average, those who reported sleeping 6 or fewer hours per night had an increased risk for crash compared with those who reported sleeping more than 6 hours (relative risk [RR], 1.21; 95% CI, 1.04-1.41). Less weekend sleep was significantly associated with an increased risk for run-off-road crashes (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.21-2.00). Crashes for individuals who had less sleep per night (on average and on weekends) were significantly more likely to occur between 8 pm and 6 am (RR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.11-3.13, for midnight to 5:59 am and RR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.15-2.39, for 8:00 pm to 11:59 pm). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Less sleep per night significantly increased the risk for crash for young drivers. Less sleep on weekend nights increased the risk for run-off-road crashes and crashes occurring in the late-night hours. This provides rationale for governments and health care providers to address sleep-related crashes among young drivers.","Accidents, Traffic/*statistics & numerical data Adolescent Automobile Driving/*statistics & numerical data Female Humans Male New South Wales/epidemiology Prospective Studies Risk Factors Sleep Deprivation/*epidemiology Time Factors Young Adult"

OBJECTIVE: To test if fasting plasma concentration of a stable 117-amino acid fragment from the neurotensin precursor hormone proneurotensin is associated with development of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, and mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Proneurotensin was measured in plasma from 4632 fasting participants of the population-based Malmo Diet and Cancer Study baseline examination 1991-1994. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to relate baseline proneurotensin to first events and death during long-term follow-up until January 2009, with median follow-up ranging from 13.2 to 15.7 years depending on the disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, and mortality.

23117780,Lifetime risk and years lived free of total cardiovascular disease.,JAMA,Wilkins JT and Ning H and Berry J and Zhao L and Dyer AR and Lloyd-Jones DM,northwestern,"CONTEXT: Estimates of lifetime risk for total cardiovascular disease (CVD) may provide projections of the future population burden of CVD and may assist in clinician-patient risk communication. To date, no lifetime risk estimates of total CVD have been reported. OBJECTIVES: To calculate lifetime risk estimates of total CVD by index age (45, 55, 65, 75 years) and risk factor strata and to estimate years lived free of CVD across risk factor strata. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Pooled survival analysis of as many as 905,115 person-years of data from 1964 through 2008 from 5 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded community-based cohorts: Framingham Heart Study, Framingham Offspring Study, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Chicago Heart Association Detection Project in Industry Study, and Cardiovascular Health Study. All participants were free of CVD at baseline with risk factor data (blood pressure [BP], total cholesterol [TC], diabetes, and smoking status) and total CVD outcome data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Any total CVD event (including fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease, all forms of stroke, congestive heart failure, and other CVD deaths). RESULTS: At an index age of 45 years, overall lifetime risk for total CVD was 60.3% (95% CI, 59.3%-61.2%) for men and 55.6% (95% CI, 54.5%-56.7%) for women. Men had higher lifetime risk estimates than women across all index ages. At index ages 55 and 65 years, men and women with at least 1 elevated risk factor (BP, 140-149/90-99 mm Hg; or TC, 200-239 mg/dL; but no diabetes or smoking), 1 major risk factor, or at least 2 major risk factors (BP, >/=160/100 mm Hg or receiving treatment; TC, >/=240 mg/dL or receiving treatment; diabetes mellitus; or current smoking) had lifetime risk estimates to age 95 years that exceeded 50%. Despite an optimal risk factor profile (BP, <120/80 mm Hg; TC, <180 mg/dL; and no smoking or diabetes), men and women at the index age of 55 years had lifetime risks (through 85 years of age) for total CVD of greater than 40% and 30%, respectively. Compared with participants with at least 2 major risk factors, those with an optimal risk factor profile lived up to 14 years longer free of total CVD. CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime risk estimates for total CVD were high (>30%) for all individuals, even those with optimal risk factors in middle age. However, maintenance of optimal risk factor levels in middle age was associated with substantially longer morbidity-free survival.",Adult Aged Blood Pressure Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology Cohort Studies Diabetes Mellitus Female Forecasting Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged Morbidity *Risk Risk Factors Smoking
23288416,Long-term use of aspirin and age-related macular degeneration.,JAMA,Klein BE and Howard KP and Gangnon RE and Dreyer JO and Lee KE and Klein R,wisc,"CONTEXT: Aspirin is widely used for relief of pain and for cardioprotective effects. Its use is of concern to ophthalmologists when ocular surgery is being considered and also in the presence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of regular aspirin use with incidence of AMD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Beaver Dam Eye Study, a longitudinal population-based study of age-related eye diseases conducted in Wisconsin. Examinations were performed every 5 years over a 20-year period (1988-1990 through 2008-2010). Study participants (N = 4926) were aged 43 to 86 years at the baseline examination. At subsequent examinations, participants were asked if they had regularly used aspirin at least twice a week for more than 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of early AMD, late AMD, and 2 subtypes of late AMD (neovascular AMD and pure geographic atrophy), assessed in retinal photographs according to the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System. RESULTS: The mean duration of follow-up was 14.8 years. There were 512 incident cases of early AMD (of 6243 person-visits at risk) and 117 incident cases of late AMD (of 8621 person-visits at risk) over the course of the study. Regular aspirin use 10 years prior to retinal examination was associated with late AMD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63 [95% CI, 1.01-2.63]; P = .05), with estimated incidence of 1.76% (95% CI, 1.17%-2.64%) in regular users and 1.03% (95% CI, 0.70%-1.51%) in nonusers. For subtypes of late AMD, regular aspirin use 10 years prior to retinal examination was significantly associated with neovascular AMD (HR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.20-4.15]; P = .01) but not pure geographic atrophy (HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.25-1.95]; P = .45). Aspirin use 5 years (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.71-1.05]; P = .13) or 10 years (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.65-1.13]; P = .28) prior to retinal examination was not associated with incident early AMD. CONCLUSIONS: Among an adult cohort, aspirin use 5 years prior to observed incidence was not associated with incident early or late AMD. However, regular aspirin use 10 years prior was associated with a small but statistically significant increase in the risk of incident late and neovascular AMD.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Aspirin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Cohort Studies Drug Administration Schedule Female Humans Incidence Macular Degeneration/classification/*epidemiology Male Middle Aged Risk Time Factors Wisconsin/epidemiology"
23921840,Use of antihypertensive medications and breast cancer risk among women aged 55 to 74 years.,JAMA Intern Med,Li CI and Daling JR and Tang MT and Haugen KL and Porter PL and Malone KE,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Antihypertensive agents are the most commonly prescribed class of medications in the United States. Evidence regarding the relationship between different types of antihypertensives and breast cancer risk is sparse and inconsistent, and prior studies have lacked the capacity to assess impacts of long-term use. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between use of various classes of antihypertensive medications and risks of invasive ductal and invasive lobular breast cancers among postmenopausal women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based case-control study in the 3-county Seattle-Puget Sound metropolitan area. Participants were women aged 55 to 74 years, 880 of them with invasive ductal breast cancer, 1027 with invasive lobular breast cancer, and 856 with no cancer serving as controls. EXPOSURES: Recency and duration of use of antihypertensive medications. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risks of invasive ductal and invasive lobular breast cancers. RESULTS: Current use of calcium-channel blockers for 10 or more years was associated with higher risks of ductal breast cancer (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-4.9) (P= .04 for trend) and lobular breast cancer (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.3) (P= .01 for trend). This relationship did not vary appreciably by type of calcium-channel blocker used (short-acting vs long-acting, dihydropyridines vs non-dihydropyridines). In contrast, use of diuretics, beta-blockers, and angiotensin II antagonists were not associated with risk. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: While some studies have suggested a positive association between calcium-channel blocker use and breast cancer risk, this is the first study to observe that long-term current use of calcium-channel blockers in particular are associated with breast cancer risk. Additional research is needed to confirm this finding and to evaluate potential underlying biological mechanisms.","Aged Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/*epidemiology/etiology Carcinoma, Lobular/*epidemiology/etiology Female Humans Hypertension/complications/*drug therapy Incidence Middle Aged Odds Ratio *Postmenopause Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment/*methods Risk Factors Survival Rate/trends Time Factors Washington/epidemiology"

The long-term outcomes for remission and diabetes-related complications are not known. OBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term diabetes remission rates and the cumulative incidence of microvascular and macrovascular diabetes complications after bariatric surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) is a prospective matched cohort study conducted at 25 surgical departments and 480 primary health care centers in Sweden. Of patients recruited between September 1, 1987, and January 31, 2001, 260 of 2037 control patients and 343 of 2010 surgery patients had type 2 diabetes at baseline. For the current analysis, diabetes status was determined at SOS health examinations until May 22, 2013. Information on diabetes complications was obtained from national health registers until December 31, 2012. Participation rates at the 2-, 10-, and 15-year examinations were 81%, 58%, and 41% in the control group and 90%, 76%, and 47% in the surgery group. For diabetes assessment, the median follow-up time was 10 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2-15) and 10 years (IQR, 10-15) in the control and surgery groups, respectively. For diabetes complications, the median follow-up time was 17.6 years (IQR, 14.2-19.8) and 18.1 years (IQR, 15.2-21.1) in the control and surgery groups, respectively. INTERVENTIONS: Adjustable or nonadjustable banding (n = 61), vertical banded gastroplasty (n = 227), or gastric bypass (n = 55) procedures were performed in the surgery group, and usual obesity and diabetes care was provided to the control group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diabetes remission, relapse, and diabetes complications. Remission was defined as blood glucose <110 mg/dL and no diabetes medication. RESULTS: The diabetes remission rate 2 years after surgery was 16.4% (95% CI, 11.7%-22.2%; 34/207) for control patients and 72.3% (95% CI, 66.9%-77.2%; 219/303) for bariatric surgery patients (odds ratio [OR], 13.3; 95% CI, 8.5-20.7; P < .001). At 15 years, the diabetes remission rates decreased to 6.5% (4/62) for control patients and to 30.4% (35/115) for bariatric surgery patients (OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 2.1-18.9; P < .001). With long-term follow-up, the cumulative incidence of microvascular complications was 41.8 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 35.3-49.5) for control patients and 20.6 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 17.0-24.9) in the surgery group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% CI, 0.34-0.56; P < .001). Macrovascular complications were observed in 44.2 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 37.5-52.1) in control patients and 31.7 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 27.0-37.2) for the surgical group (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.85; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this very long-term follow-up observational study of obese patients with type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery was associated with more frequent diabetes remission and fewer complications than usual care.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of long-term aldosterone receptor blockade in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The primary objective was to determine whether spironolactone is superior to placebo in improving diastolic function and maximal exercise capacity in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. DESIGN AND SETTING: The Aldo-DHF trial, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between March 2007 and April 2012 at 10 sites in Germany and Austria that included 422 ambulatory patients (mean age, 67 [SD, 8] years; 52% female) with chronic New York Heart Association class II or III heart failure, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% or greater, and evidence of diastolic dysfunction. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone once daily (n=213) or matching placebo (n=209) with 12 months of follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The equally ranked co-primary end points were changes in diastolic function (E/e') on echocardiography and maximal exercise capacity (peak VO2) on cardiopulmonary exercise testing, both measured at 12 months. RESULTS: Diastolic function (E/e') decreased from 12.7 (SD, 3.6) to 12.1 (SD, 3.7) with spironolactone and increased from 12.8 (SD, 4.4) to 13.6 (SD, 4.3) with placebo (adjusted mean difference, -1.5; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.9; P < .001). Peak VO2 did not significantly change with spironolactone vs placebo (from 16.3 [SD, 3.6] mL/min/kg to 16.8 [SD, 4.6] mL/min/kg and from 16.4 [SD, 3.5] mL/min/kg to 16.9 [SD, 4.4] mL/min/kg, respectively; adjusted mean difference, +0.1 mL/min/kg; 95% CI, -0.6 to +0.8 mL/min/kg; P = .81). Spironolactone induced reverse remodeling (left ventricular mass index declined; difference, -6 g/m2; 95% CI, -10 to-1 g/m2; P = .009) and improved neuroendocrine activation (N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide geometric mean ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.99; P = .03) but did not improve heart failure symptoms or quality of life and slightly reduced 6-minute walking distance (-15 m; 95% CI, -27 to -2 m; P = .03). Spironolactone also modestly increased serum potassium levels (+0.2 mmol/L; 95% CI, +0.1 to +0.3; P < .001) and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (-5 mL/min/1.73 m2; 95% CI, -8 to -3 mL/min/1.73 m2; P < .001) without affecting hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized controlled trial, long-term aldosterone receptor blockade improved left ventricular diastolic function but did not affect maximal exercise capacity, patient symptoms, or quality of life in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Whether the improved left ventricular function observed in the Aldo-DHF trial is of clinical significance requires further investigation in larger populations.

23860986,Association between duration of overall and abdominal obesity beginning in young adulthood and coronary artery calcification in middle age.,JAMA,Reis JP and Loria CM and Lewis CE and Powell-Wiley TM and Wei GS and Carr JJ and Terry JG and Liu K,nih,"IMPORTANCE: Younger individuals are experiencing a greater cumulative exposure to excess adiposity over their lifetime. However, few studies have determined the consequences of long-term obesity. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the duration of overall and abdominal obesity was associated with the presence and 10-year progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC), a subclinical predictor of coronary heart disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study of 3275 white and black adults aged 18 to 30 years at baseline in 1985-1986 who did not initially have overall obesity (body mass index [BMI] >/=30) or abdominal obesity (men: waist circumference [WC] >102 cm; women: >88 cm) in the multicenter, community-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Participants completed computed tomography scanning for the presence of CAC during the 15-, 20-, or 25-year follow-up examinations. Duration of overall and abdominal obesity was calculated using repeat measurements of BMI and WC, respectively, performed 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years after baseline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Presence of CAC was measured by computed tomography at the year 15 (2000-2001), year 20 (2005-2006), or year 25 (2010-2011) follow-up examinations. Ten-year progression of CAC (2000-2001 to 2010-2011) was defined as incident CAC in 2010-2011 or an increase in CAC score of 20 Agatston units or greater. RESULTS: During follow-up, 40.4% and 41.0% developed overall and abdominal obesity, respectively. Rates of CAC per 1000 person-years were higher for those who experienced more than 20 years vs 0 years of overall obesity (16.0 vs 11.0, respectively) and abdominal obesity (16.7 vs 11.0). Approximately 25.2% and 27.7% of those with more than 20 years of overall and abdominal obesity, respectively, experienced progression of CAC vs 20.2% and 19.5% of those with 0 years. After adjustment for BMI or WC and potential confounders, the hazard ratios for CAC for each additional year of overall or abdominal obesity were 1.02 (95% CI, 1.01-1.03) and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.02-1.05), respectively. The adjusted odds ratios for CAC progression were 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01-1.06) and 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01-1.07), respectively. Associations were attenuated but largely persisted following additional adjustment for potential intermediate metabolic factors during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Longer duration of overall and abdominal obesity was associated with subclinical coronary heart disease and its progression through midlife independent of the degree of adiposity. Preventing or at least delaying the onset of obesity in young adulthood may lower the risk of developing atherosclerosis through middle age.","*Abdominal Fat *Adiposity Adolescent Adult Body Mass Index Coronary Artery Disease/*epidemiology/radiography Disease Progression Female Humans Male Middle Aged Obesity/*epidemiology Prospective Studies Risk Time Factors Tomography, X-Ray Computed Vascular Calcification/*epidemiology/radiography Young Adult"

Standard courses of pharmacotherapeutic cessation aids improve short-term abstinence, but most who attain abstinence relapse rapidly after discontinuation of pharmacotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether smokers diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disease have higher rates of prolonged tobacco abstinence with maintenance pharmacotherapy than with standard treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, relapse-prevention clinical trial conducted in 10 community mental-health centers. Of 247 smokers with schizophrenia or bipolar disease recruited from March 2008-April 2012, 203 received 12-weeks' open-label varenicline and cognitive behavioral therapy and 87 met abstinence criteria to enter the relapse prevention intervention. INTERVENTIONS: Participants who had 2 weeks or more of continuous abstinence at week 12 of open treatment were randomly assigned to receive cognitive behavioral therapy and double-blind varenicline (1 mg, 2 per day) or placebo from weeks 12 to 52. Participants then discontinued study treatment and were followed up to week 76. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Seven-day rate of continuous abstinence at study week 52, the end of the relapse-prevention phase, confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide. Secondary outcomes were continuous abstinence rates for weeks 12 through 64 based on biochemically verified abstinence and weeks 12 through 76, based on self-reported smoking behavior. RESULTS: Sixty-one participants completed the relapse-prevention phase; 26 discontinued participation (7 varenicline, 19 placebo) and were considered to have relapsed for the analyses; 18 of these had relapsed prior to dropout. At week 52, point-prevalence abstinence rates were 60% in the varenicline group (24 of 40) vs 19% (9 of 47) in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR], 6.2; 95% CI, 2.2-19.2; P < .001). From weeks 12 through 64, 45% (18 of 40) among those in the varenicline group vs 15% (7 of 47) in the placebo group were continuously abstinent (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.5-15.7; P = .004), and from weeks 12 through 76, 30% (12 of 40) in the varenicline group vs 11% (5 of 47) in the placebo group were continuously abstinent (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.02-13.6; P = .03). There were no significant treatment effects on psychiatric symptom ratings or psychiatric adverse events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among smokers with serious mental illness who attained initial abstinence with standard treatment, maintenance pharmacotherapy with varenicline and cognitive behavioral therapy improved prolonged tobacco abstinence rates compared with cognitive behavioral therapy alone after 1 year of treatment and at 6 months after treatment discontinuation.

2013,"Rapid infusion of sodium bicarbonate and albumin into high-risk premature infants soon after birth: a controlled, prospective trial.",Am J Obstet Gynecol,Bland RD and Clarke TL and Harden LB,Missing,"We conducted a controlled, prospective trial to evaluate the effectiveness of rapidly infusing sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and salt-poor albumin into high-risk, premature infants in the first 2 hours of life. Fifty-three infants, randomized into one of four treatment groups, received 8 ml. per kilogram of a solution containing either (A) glucose in water, (B) salt-poor albumin, (C) NaHCO3, or (D) a combination of albumin and NaHCO3. After the initial infusion, the babies received no colloid or alkali solutions until 4 hours of age. We managed them supportively with warmth, appropriate oxygen administration, isotonic fluid infusion, and close monitoring. Among the infants who received alkali, 14 of 26 acquired the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 11 died, and four had intracranial hemorrhage. Among babies who received no alkali, RDS occurred in 11 of 27, 5 died, and none had intracranial hemorrhage. These results do not support the common practice of rapidly infusing NaHCO3 into high-risk, premature infants, and they suggest that the early management of such infants needs renewed critical evaluation.","Acidosis/*drug therapy Albumins/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Bicarbonates/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Carbon Dioxide/blood Cerebral Hemorrhage/mortality Female Hawaii Humans Hydrogen-Ion Concentration Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature, Diseases/blood/*drug therapy/mortality Infusions, Parenteral Male Prospective Studies Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/mortality Sodium/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use Time Factors"

High BP in midlife has been associated with more brain atrophy later in life, whereas studies in older populations have shown a relation between low BP and more brain atrophy. Yet, prospective evidence is limited, and the relation remains unclear in patients with manifest arterial disease. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of baseline BP and change in BP over time with progression of brain atrophy. DESIGN: The Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease-Magnetic Resonance (SMART-MR) Study is a prospective cohort study with baseline measurements in 2001-2005 and follow-up measurements in 2006-2009. The mean follow-up time was 3.9 years. SETTING: University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 663 patients (mean [SD] age, 57 [9] years; 81% male) with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, or abdominal aortic aneurysm were included. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Using automated segmentation at baseline and follow-up, change in brain parenchymal fraction, cortical gray matter fraction, and ventricular fraction (%ICV) were quantified as indicators of progression of global, cortical, and subcortical brain atrophy. RESULTS: Multivariable adjusted regression analysis showed that patients with lower baseline diastolic BP (DBP) or mean arterial pressure had more progression of subcortical atrophy. The mean differences in the change in ventricular fraction between low and high DBP was 0.07% (95% CI, 0.01-0.14) and between low and high mean arterial pressure was 0.05% (95% CI, 0.00-0.10). Furthermore, in patients with higher baseline BP (DBP, mean arterial pressure, or systolic BP), those with declining BP levels over time had less progression of subcortical atrophy compared with those with rising BP levels. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with manifest arterial disease, low baseline DBP was associated with more progression of subcortical atrophy, irrespective of the BP course during follow-up. Furthermore, in patients with higher baseline BP, declining BP levels over time were associated with less progression of subcortical atrophy. This could imply that BP lowering is beneficial in patients with higher BP levels, but caution should be taken with further BP lowering in patients who already have a low DBP.",Adult Aged Atrophy/etiology/pathology Blood Pressure/*physiology Brain/blood supply/*pathology/physiopathology Cerebral Cortex/pathology/physiopathology Cohort Studies Disease Progression Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Netherlands Prospective Studies Vascular Diseases/*complications
23793267,"Health status, risk factors, and medical conditions among persons enrolled in Medicaid vs uninsured low-income adults potentially eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.",JAMA,Decker SL and Kostova D and Kenney GM and Long SK,cdc,"IMPORTANCE: Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), states can extend Medicaid eligibility to nearly all adults with income no more than 138% of the federal poverty level. Uncertainty exists regarding the scope of medical services required for new enrollees. OBJECTIVE: To document the health care needs and health risks of uninsured adults who could gain Medicaid coverage under the ACA. These data will help physicians, other clinicians, and state Medicaid programs prepare for the possible expansions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2010 were used to analyze health conditions among a nationally representative sample of 1042 uninsured adults aged 19 through 64 years with income no more than 138% of the federal poverty level, compared with 471 low-income adults currently enrolled in Medicaid. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence and control of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia based on examinations and laboratory tests, measures of self-reported health status including medical conditions, and risk factors such as measured obesity status. RESULTS: Compared with those already enrolled in Medicaid, uninsured adults were less likely to be obese and sedentary and less likely to report a physical, mental, or emotional limitation. They also were less likely to have several chronic conditions. For example, 30.1% (95% CI, 26.8%-33.4%) of uninsured adults had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes compared with 38.6% (95% CI, 32.0%-45.3%) of those enrolled in Medicaid (P = .02). However, if they had these conditions, uninsured adults were less likely to be aware of them and less likely to have them controlled. For example, 80.1% (95% CI, 75.2%-85.1%) of the uninsured adults with at least 1 of these 3 conditions had at least 1 uncontrolled condition, compared with 63.4% (95% CI, 53.7%-73.1%) of adults enrolled in Medicaid. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Compared with adults currently enrolled in Medicaid, uninsured low-income adults potentially eligible to enroll in Medicaid under the ACA had a lower prevalence of many chronic conditions. A substantial proportion of currently uninsured adults with chronic conditions did not have good disease control; projections based on sample weighting suggest this may represent 3.5 million persons (95% CI, 2.9 million-4.2 million).

23212502,General medicine vs subspecialty career plans among internal medicine residents.,JAMA,West CP and Dupras DM,mayo,"CONTEXT: Current medical training models in the United States are unlikely to produce sufficient numbers of general internists and primary care physicians. Differences in general internal medicine (GIM) career plans between internal medicine residency program types and across resident demographics are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the general medicine career plans of internal medicine residents and how career plans evolve during training. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A study of US internal medicine residents using an annual survey linked to the Internal Medicine In-Training Examination taken in October of 2009-2011 to evaluate career plans by training program, sex, and medical school location. Of 67,207 US eligible categorical and primary care internal medicine residents, 57,087 (84.9%) completed and returned the survey. Demographic data provided by the National Board of Medical Examiners were available for 52,035 (77.4%) of these residents, of whom 51,390 (76.5%) responded to all survey items and an additional 645 (1.0%) responded to at least 1 survey item. Data were analyzed from the 16,781 third-year residents (32.2%) in this sample. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported ultimate career plans of internal medicine residents. RESULTS: A GIM career plan was reported by 3605 graduating residents (21.5%). A total of 562 primary care program (39.6%) and 3043 categorical (19.9%) residents reported GIM as their ultimate career plan (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.76; 99% CI, 2.35-3.23; P < .001). Conversely, 10 008 categorical (65.3%) and 745 primary care program (52.5%) residents reported a subspecialty career plan (AOR, 1.90; 99% CI, 1.62-2.23; P < .001).

24820907,"Rates of adverse events associated with male circumcision in U.S. medical settings, 2001 to 2010.",JAMA Pediatr,El Bcheraoui C and Zhang X and Cooper CS and Rose CE and Kilmarx PH and Chen RT,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Approximately 1.4 million male circumcisions (MCs) are performed annually in US medical settings. However, population-based estimates of MC-associated adverse events (AEs) are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the incidence rate of MC-associated AEs and to assess whether AE rates differed by age at circumcision. DESIGN: We selected 41 possible MC AEs based on a literature review and on medical billing codes. We estimated a likely risk window for the incidence calculation for each MC AE based on pathogenesis. We used 2001 to 2010 data from SDI Health, a large administrative claims data set, to conduct a retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: SDI Health provided administrative claims data from inpatient and outpatient US medical settings. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For each AE, we calculated the incidence per million MCs. We compared the incidence risk ratio and the incidence rate difference for circumcised vs uncircumcised newborn males and for males circumcised at younger than 1 year, age 1 to 9 years, or 10 years or older. An AE was considered probably related to MC if the incidence risk ratio significantly exceeded 1 at P < .05 or occurred only in circumcised males. RESULTS: Records were available for 1,400,920 circumcised males, 93.3% as newborns. Of 41 possible MC AEs, 16 (39.0%) were probable. The incidence of total MC AEs was slightly less than 0.5%. Rates of potentially serious MC AEs ranged from 0.76 (95% CI, 0.10-5.43) per million MCs for stricture of male genital organs to 703.23 (95% CI, 659.22-750.18) per million MCs for repair of incomplete circumcision. Compared with boys circumcised at younger than 1 year, the incidences of probable AEs were approximately 20-fold and 10-fold greater for males circumcised at age 1 to 9 years and at 10 years or older, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Male circumcision had a low incidence of AEs overall, especially if the procedure was performed during the first year of life, but rose 10-fold to 20-fold when performed after infancy.","Age Factors Child Child, Preschool Circumcision, Male/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Male Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/etiology Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Treatment Outcome United States/epidemiology"

25154332,"Medical Cannabis Laws and Opioid Analgesic Overdose Mortality in the United States, 1999-2010.",JAMA Intern Med,Bachhuber MA and Saloner B and Cunningham CO and Barry CL,Missing,"Importance: Opioid analgesic overdose mortality continues to rise in the United States, driven by increases in prescribing for chronic pain. Because chronic pain is a major indication for medical cannabis, laws that establish access to medical cannabis may change overdose mortality related to opioid analgesics in states that have enacted them. Objective: To determine the association between the presence of state medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic overdose mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: A time-series analysis was conducted of medical cannabis laws and state-level death certificate data in the United States from 1999 to 2010; all 50 states were included. Exposures: Presence of a law establishing a medical cannabis program in the state. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-adjusted opioid analgesic overdose death rate per 100 000 population in each state. Regression models were developed including state and year fixed effects, the presence of 3 different policies regarding opioid analgesics, and the state-specific unemployment rate. Results: Three states (California, Oregon, and Washington) had medical cannabis laws effective prior to 1999. Ten states (Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Vermont) enacted medical cannabis laws between 1999 and 2010. States with medical cannabis laws had a 24.8% lower mean annual opioid overdose mortality rate (95% CI, -37.5% to -9.5%; P = .003) compared with states without medical cannabis laws. Examination of the association between medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic overdose mortality in each year after implementation of the law showed that such laws were associated with a lower rate of overdose mortality that generally strengthened over time: year 1 (-19.9%; 95% CI, -30.6% to -7.7%; P = .002), year 2 (-25.2%; 95% CI, -40.6% to -5.9%; P = .01), year 3 (-23.6%; 95% CI, -41.1% to -1.0%; P = .04), year 4 (-20.2%; 95% CI, -33.6% to -4.0%; P = .02), year 5 (-33.7%; 95% CI, -50.9% to -10.4%; P = .008), and year 6 (-33.3%; 95% CI, -44.7% to -19.6%; P < .001). In secondary analyses, the findings remained similar. Conclusions and Relevance: Medical cannabis laws are associated with significantly lower state-level opioid overdose mortality rates. Further investigation is required to determine how medical cannabis laws may interact with policies aimed at preventing opioid analgesic overdose.",Missing

This has been cited as evidence that persons dying in the United States are using more supportive care. OBJECTIVE: To describe changes in site of death, place of care, and health care transitions between 2000, 2005, and 2009. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective cohort study of a random 20% sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, aged 66 years and older, who died in 2000 (n = 270,202), 2005 (n = 291,819), or 2009 (n = 286,282). A multivariable regression model examined outcomes in 2000 and 2009 after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics. Based on billing data, patients were classified as having a medical diagnosis of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or dementia in the last 180 days of life. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Site of death, place of care, rates of health care transitions, and potentially burdensome transitions (eg, health care transitions in the last 3 days of life). RESULTS: Our random 20% sample included 848,303 fee-for-service Medicare decedents (mean age, 82.3 years; 57.9% female, 88.1% white). Comparing 2000, 2005, and 2009, the proportion of deaths in acute care hospitals decreased from 32.6% (95% CI, 32.4%-32.8%) to 26.9% (95% CI, 26.7%-27.1%) to 24.6% (95% CI, 24.5%-24.8%), respectively. However, intensive care unit (ICU) use in the last month of life increased from 24.3% (95% CI, 24.1%-24.5%) to 26.3% (95% CI, 26.1%-26.5%) to 29.2% (95% CI, 29.0%-29.3%). (Test of trend P value was <.001 for each variable.) Hospice use at the time of death increased from 21.6% (95% CI, 21.4%-21.7%) to 32.3% (95% CI, 32.1%-32.5%) to 42.2% (95% CI, 42.0%-42.4%), with 28.4% (95% CI, 27.9%-28.5%) using a hospice for 3 days or less in 2009. Of these late hospice referrals, 40.3% (95% CI, 39.7%-40.8%) were preceded by hospitalization with an ICU stay. The mean number of health care transitions in the last 90 days of life increased from 2.1 (interquartile range [IQR], 0-3.0) to 2.8 (IQR, 1.0-4.0) to 3.1 per decedent (IQR, 1.0-5.0). The percentage of patients experiencing transitions in the last 3 days of life increased from 10.3% (95% CI, 10.1%-10.4%) to 12.4% (95% CI, 12.3%-2.5%) to 14.2% (95% CI, 14.0%-14.3%).

23073953,Association between a chloride-liberal vs chloride-restrictive intravenous fluid administration strategy and kidney injury in critically ill adults.,JAMA,Yunos NM and Bellomo R and Hegarty C and Story D and Ho L and Bailey M,Missing,"CONTEXT: Administration of traditional chloride-liberal intravenous fluids may precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI). OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of a chloride-restrictive (vs chloride-liberal) intravenous fluid strategy with AKI in critically ill patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Prospective, open-label, sequential period pilot study of 760 patients admitted consecutively to the intensive care unit (ICU) during the control period (February 18 to August 17, 2008) compared with 773 patients admitted consecutively during the intervention period (February 18 to August 17, 2009) at a university-affiliated hospital in Melbourne, Australia. INTERVENTIONS: During the control period, patients received standard intravenous fluids. After a 6-month phase-out period (August 18, 2008, to February 17, 2009), any use of chloride-rich intravenous fluids (0.9% saline, 4% succinylated gelatin solution, or 4% albumin solution) was restricted to attending specialist approval only during the intervention period; patients instead received a lactated solution (Hartmann solution), a balanced solution (Plasma-Lyte 148), and chloride-poor 20% albumin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes included increase from baseline to peak creatinine level in the ICU and incidence of AKI according to the risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage (RIFLE) classification. Secondary post hoc analysis outcomes included the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), length of stay in ICU and hospital, and survival. RESULTS Chloride administration decreased by 144 504 mmol (from 694 to 496 mmol/patient) from the control period to the intervention period. Comparing the control period with the intervention period, the mean serum creatinine level increase while in the ICU was 22.6 mumol/L (95% CI, 17.5-27.7 mumol/L) vs 14.8 mumol/L (95% CI, 9.8-19.9 mumol/L) (P = .03), the incidence of injury and failure class of RIFLE-defined AKI was 14% (95% CI, 11%-16%; n = 105) vs 8.4% (95% CI, 6.4%-10%; n = 65) (P <.001), and the use of RRT was 10% (95% CI, 8.1%-12%; n = 78) vs 6.3% (95% CI, 4.6%-8.1%; n = 49) (P = .005). After adjustment for covariates, this association remained for incidence of injury and failure class of RIFLE-defined AKI (odds ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.37-0.75]; P <.001) and use of RRT (odds ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.33-0.81]; P = .004). There were no differences in hospital mortality, hospital or ICU length of stay, or need for RRT after hospital discharge. CONCLUSION The implementation of a chloride-restrictive strategy in a tertiary ICU was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of AKI and use of RRT.

In populations with endemic infectious lung disease, FDG-PET may not accurately identify malignant lesions. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET for pulmonary nodules suspicious for lung cancer in regions where infectious lung disease is endemic and compare the test accuracy in regions where infectious lung disease is rare. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Web of Science were searched from October 1, 2000, through April 28, 2014. Articles reporting information sufficient to calculate sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET to diagnose lung cancer were included. Only studies that enrolled more than 10 participants with benign and malignant lesions were included. Database searches yielded 1923 articles, of which 257 were assessed for eligibility. Seventy studies were included in the analysis. Studies reported on a total of 8511 nodules; 5105 (60%) were malignant. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Abstracts meeting eligibility criteria were collected by a research librarian and reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. Hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed. A random-effects logistic regression model was used to summarize and assess the effect of endemic infectious lung disease on test performance. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The sensitivity and specificity for FDG-PET test performance. RESULTS: Heterogeneity for sensitivity (I2 = 87%) and specificity (I2 = 82%) was observed across studies. The pooled (unadjusted) sensitivity was 89% (95% CI, 86%-91%) and specificity was 75% (95% CI, 71%-79%). There was a 16% lower average adjusted specificity in regions with endemic infectious lung disease (61% [95% CI, 49%-72%]) compared with nonendemic regions (77% [95% CI, 73%-80%]). Lower specificity was observed when the analysis was limited to rigorously conducted and well-controlled studies. In general, sensitivity did not change appreciably by endemic infection status, even after adjusting for relevant factors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The accuracy of FDG-PET for diagnosing lung nodules was extremely heterogeneous. Use of FDG-PET combined with computed tomography was less specific in diagnosing malignancy in populations with endemic infectious lung disease compared with nonendemic regions. These data do not support the use of FDG-PET to diagnose lung cancer in endemic regions unless an institution achieves test performance accuracy similar to that found in nonendemic regions.",Missing

They occur in ductal carcinoma in situ, in breast cancers, and in breast cancer stem and progenitor cells (BCSCs). OBJECTIVES: To determine if variability in clinical presentation at diagnosis correlates with PI3K/Akt mutations in BCSCs and provides an early prognostic indicator of increased progression and metastatic potential. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Malignant (BCSCs) and benign stem cells were collected from fresh surgical specimens via cell sorting and tested for oncogene mutations in a university hospital surgical oncology research laboratory from 30 invasive ductal breast cancers (stages IA through IIIB). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Presence of AKT1, HRAS, and PIK3CA mutations in BCSCs and their correlation with tumor mutations, pathologic tumor stage, tumor histologic grade, tumor hormone receptor status, lymph node metastases, and patient age and condition at the last follow-up contact. RESULTS: Ten tumors had mutations in their BCSCs. In total, 9 tumors with BCSC mutations and 4 tumors with BCSCs without mutations had associated tumor present in the lymph nodes (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Tumors in which BCSCs have defects in PI3K/Akt signaling are significantly more likely to manifest nodal metastases. These oncogenic defects may be missed by gross molecular testing of the tumor and are markers of more aggressive breast cancer. Molecular profiling of BCSCs may identify patients who would likely benefit from PI3K/Akt inhibitors, which are being tested in clinical trials.","Age Factors *Axilla Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/*genetics/pathology Disease Progression Female Humans Lymphatic Metastasis/*genetics/pathology Middle Aged *Mutation Neoplasm Grading Neoplasm Staging Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*genetics Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*genetics Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization Stem Cells/*pathology"

OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between exposure to antenatal magnesium sulfate and neurological, cognitive, academic, and behavioral outcomes at school age. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The ACTOMgSO4 was a randomized clinical trial conducted in 16 centers in Australia and New Zealand, comparing magnesium sulfate with placebo given to pregnant women (n = 535 magnesium; n = 527 placebo) for whom imminent birth was planned or expected before 30 weeks' gestation. Children who survived from the 14 centers who participated in the school-age follow-up (n = 443 magnesium; n = 424 placebo) were invited for an assessment at 6 to 11 years of age between 2005 and 2011. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mortality, cerebral palsy, motor function, IQ, basic academic skills, attention and executive function, behavior, growth, and functional outcomes. Main analyses were imputed for missing data. RESULTS: Of the 1255 fetuses known to be alive at randomization, the mortality rate to school age was 14% (88/629) in the magnesium sulfate group and 18% (110/626) in the placebo group (risk ratio [RR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.62-1.03, P = .08). Of 867 survivors available for follow-up, outcomes at school age (corrected age 6-11 years) were determined for 669 (77%). Comparing the magnesium sulfate and placebo groups revealed no statistically significant difference in proportions with cerebral palsy (23/295 [8%] and 21/314 [7%], respectively; odds ratio [OR], 1.26; 95% CI, 0.84-1.91; P = .27) or abnormal motor function (80/297 [27%] and 80/300 [27%], respectively; OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.88-1.52; P = .28). There was also little difference between groups on any of the cognitive, behavioral, growth, or functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Magnesium sulfate given to pregnant women at imminent risk of birth before 30 weeks' gestation was not associated with neurological, cognitive, behavioral, growth, or functional outcomes in their children at school age, although a mortality advantage cannot be excluded. The lack of long-term benefit requires confirmation in additional studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12606000252516.",Missing

Knowledge on effective approaches for screening the underserved, including best test type to offer, is limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine (1) if organized mailed outreach boosts CRC screening compared with usual care and (2) if FIT is superior to colonoscopy outreach for CRC screening participation in an underserved population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We identified uninsured patients, not up to date with CRC screening, age 54 to 64 years, served by the John Peter Smith Health Network, Fort Worth and Tarrant County, Texas, a safety net health system. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 groups. One group was assigned to fecal immunochemical test (FIT) outreach, consisting of mailed invitation to use and return an enclosed no-cost FIT (n = 1593). A second was assigned to colonoscopy outreach, consisting of mailed invitation to schedule a no-cost colonoscopy (n = 479). The third group was assigned to usual care, consisting of opportunistic primary care visit-based screening (n = 3898). In addition, FIT and colonoscopy outreach groups received telephone follow-up to promote test completion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Screening participation in any CRC test within 1 year after randomization. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 59 years; 64% of patients were women. The sample was 41% white, 24% black, 29% Hispanic, and 7% other race/ethnicity. Screening participation was significantly higher for both FIT (40.7%) and colonoscopy outreach (24.6%) than for usual care (12.1%) (P < .001 for both comparisons with usual care). Screening was significantly higher for FIT than for colonoscopy outreach (P < .001). In stratified analyses, screening was higher for FIT and colonoscopy outreach than for usual care, and higher for FIT than for colonoscopy outreach among whites, blacks, and Hispanics (P < .005 for all comparisons). Rates of CRC identification and advanced adenoma detection were 0.4% and 0.8% for FIT outreach, 0.4% and 1.3% for colonoscopy outreach, and 0.2% and 0.4% for usual care, respectively (P < .05 for colonoscopy vs usual care advanced adenoma comparison; P > .05 for all other comparisons). Eleven of 60 patients with abnormal FIT results did not complete colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS AND REVELANCE: Among underserved patients whose CRC screening was not up to date, mailed outreach invitations resulted in markedly higher CRC screening compared with usual care. Outreach was more effective with FIT than with colonoscopy invitation.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether maintenance tocolysis with nifedipine will reduce adverse perinatal outcomes due to premature birth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: APOSTEL-II (Assessment of Perinatal Outcome with Sustained Tocolysis in Early Labor) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed in 11 perinatal units including all tertiary centers in The Netherlands. From June 2008 to February 2010, women with threatened preterm labor between 26 weeks (plus 0 days) and 32 weeks (plus 2 days) gestation, who had not delivered after 48 hours of tocolysis and a completed course of corticosteroids, were enrolled. Surviving infants were followed up until 6 months after birth (ended August 2010). INTERVENTION: Randomization assigned 406 women to maintenance tocolysis with nifedipine orally (80 mg/d; n = 201) or placebo (n = 205) for 12 days. Assigned treatment was masked from investigators, participants, clinicians, and research nurses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was a composite of adverse perinatal outcomes (perinatal death, chronic lung disease, neonatal sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage >grade 2, periventricular leukomalacia >grade 1, or necrotizing enterocolitis). Analyses were completed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Mean (SD) gestational age at randomization was 29.2 (1.7) weeks for both groups. Adverse perinatal outcome was not significantly different between groups: 11.9% (24/201; 95% CI, 7.5%-16.4%) for nifedipine vs 13.7% (28/205; 95% CI, 9.0%-18.4%) for placebo (relative risk, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.53-1.45). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with threatened preterm labor, nifedipine-maintained tocolysis did not result in a statistically significant reduction in adverse perinatal outcomes when compared with placebo. Although the lower than anticipated rate of adverse perinatal outcomes in the control group indicates that a benefit of nifedipine cannot completely be excluded, its use for maintenance tocolysis does not appear beneficial at this time.

23483177,Association between bleeding events and in-hospital mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention.,JAMA,Chhatriwalla AK and Amin AP and Kennedy KF and House JA and Cohen DJ and Rao SV and Messenger JC and Marso SP,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Bleeding is the most common complication after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is associated with increased morbidity and health care costs. The incidence of bleeding-related mortality after PCI has not been described in a nationally representative population. Furthermore, the relationships among bleeding risk, bleeding site, and mortality are unclear. OBJECTIVES: To describe the association between bleeding events and in-hospital mortality after PCI and to estimate the adjusted population attributable risk (estimated as the proportion of mortality risk associated with bleeding events), risk difference, and number needed to harm (NNH) for bleeding-related in-hospital mortality after PCI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Data from 3,386,688 procedures in the CathPCI Registry performed in the United States between 2004 and 2011 were analyzed. The population attributable risk was calculated after adjustment for baseline demographic, clinical, and procedural variables. To calculate the NNH for bleeding-related mortality, a propensity-matched analysis was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital mortality. RESULTS: There were 57,246 bleeding events (1.7%) and 22,165 in-hospital deaths (0.65%) in 3,386,688 PCI procedures. The adjusted population attributable risk for mortality related to major bleeding was 12.1% (95% CI, 11.4%-12.7%) in the entire CathPCI cohort. The propensity-matched population consisted of 56,078 procedures with a major bleeding event and 224 312 controls. In this matched cohort, major bleeding was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (5.26% vs 1.87%; risk difference, 3.39% [95% CI, 3.20%-3.59%]; NNH = 29 [95% CI, 28-31]; P < .001). The association between major bleeding and in-hospital mortality was observed in all strata of preprocedural bleeding risk (low: 1.62% vs 0.17%; risk difference, 1.45% [95% CI, 1.13%-1.77%], NNH = 69 [95% CI, 57-88], P < .001; intermediate: 3.27% vs 0.71%; risk difference, 2.56% [95% CI, 2.33%-2.79%], NNH = 39 [95% CI, 36-43], P < .001; and high: 8.16% vs 3.45%; risk difference, 4.71% [95% CI, 4.35%-5.07%], NNH = 21 [95% CI, 20-23], P < .001). Although both access-site and non-access-site bleeding were associated with increased in-hospital mortality (2.73% vs 1.87%; risk difference, 0.86% [95% CI, 0.66%-1.05%], NNH = 117 [95% CI, 95-151], P < .001; and 8.25% vs 1.87%; risk difference, 6.39% [95% CI, 6.04%-6.73%], NNH = 16 [95% CI, 15-17], P < .001, respectively), the NNH was lower for nonaccess bleeding. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a large registry of patients undergoing PCI, postprocedural bleeding events were associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality, with an estimated 12.1% of deaths related to bleeding complications.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Female Hemorrhage/*etiology/*mortality *Hospital Mortality Humans Male Middle Aged Percutaneous Coronary Intervention/*adverse effects/*mortality Propensity Score Registries/statistics & numerical data Risk Assessment United States/epidemiology"

Weight-loss surgery (WLS) is being used to treat severely obese adolescents, although with very limited data regarding surgical safety for currently used, minimally invasive procedures. OBJECTIVE: To assess the preoperative clinical characteristics and perioperative safety outcomes of severely obese adolescents undergoing WLS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, multisite observational study enrolled patients from February 28, 2007, through December 30, 2011. Consecutive patients aged 19 years or younger who were approved to undergo WLS (n = 277) were offered enrollment into the study at 5 academic referral centers in the United States; 13 declined participation and 22 did not undergo surgery after enrollment, thus the final analysis cohort consisted of 242 individuals. There were no withdrawals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This analysis examined preoperative anthropometrics, comorbid conditions, and major and minor complications occurring within 30 days of operation. All data were collected in a standardized fashion. Reoperations and hospital readmissions were adjudicated by independent reviewers to assess relatedness to the WLS procedure. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of participants was 17.1 (1.6) years and the median body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 50.5. Fifty-one percent demonstrated 4 or more major comorbid conditions. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical sleeve gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding were performed in 66%, 28%, and 6% of patients, respectively. There were no deaths during the initial hospitalization or within 30 days of operation; major complications (eg, reoperation) were seen in 19 patients (8%). Minor complications (eg, readmission for dehydration) were noted in 36 patients (15%). All reoperations and 85% of readmissions were related to WLS. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this series, adolescents with severe obesity presented with abundant comorbid conditions. We observed a favorable short-term complication profile, supporting the early postoperative safety of WLS in select adolescents. Further longitudinal study of this cohort will permit accurate assessment of long-term outcomes for adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery.

23842577,"The state of US health, 1990-2010: burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors.",JAMA,Missing,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Understanding the major health problems in the United States and how they are changing over time is critical for informing national health policy. OBJECTIVES: To measure the burden of diseases, injuries, and leading risk factors in the United States from 1990 to 2010 and to compare these measurements with those of the 34 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. DESIGN: We used the systematic analysis of descriptive epidemiology of 291 diseases and injuries, 1160 sequelae of these diseases and injuries, and 67 risk factors or clusters of risk factors from 1990 to 2010 for 187 countries developed for the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study to describe the health status of the United States and to compare US health outcomes with those of 34 OECD countries. Years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) were computed by multiplying the number of deaths at each age by a reference life expectancy at that age. Years lived with disability (YLDs) were calculated by multiplying prevalence (based on systematic reviews) by the disability weight (based on population-based surveys) for each sequela; disability in this study refers to any short- or long-term loss of health. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. Deaths and DALYs related to risk factors were based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses of exposure data and relative risks for risk-outcome pairs. Healthy life expectancy (HALE) was used to summarize overall population health, accounting for both length of life and levels of ill health experienced at different ages. RESULTS: US life expectancy for both sexes combined increased from 75.2 years in 1990 to 78.2 years in 2010; during the same period, HALE increased from 65.8 years to 68.1 years. The diseases and injuries with the largest number of YLLs in 2010 were ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and road injury. Age-standardized YLL rates increased for Alzheimer disease, drug use disorders, chronic kidney disease, kidney cancer, and falls. The diseases with the largest number of YLDs in 2010 were low back pain, major depressive disorder, other musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety disorders. As the US population has aged, YLDs have comprised a larger share of DALYs than have YLLs. The leading risk factors related to DALYs were dietary risks, tobacco smoking, high body mass index, high blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Among 34 OECD countries between 1990 and 2010, the US rank for the age-standardized death rate changed from 18th to 27th, for the age-standardized YLL rate from 23rd to 28th, for the age-standardized YLD rate from 5th to 6th, for life expectancy at birth from 20th to 27th, and for HALE from 14th to 26th. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: From 1990 to 2010, the United States made substantial progress in improving health. Life expectancy at birth and HALE increased, all-cause death rates at all ages decreased, and age-specific rates of years lived with disability remained stable. However, morbidity and chronic disability now account for nearly half of the US health burden, and improvements in population health in the United States have not kept pace with advances in population health in other wealthy nations.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Child Child, Preschool Chronic Disease/*mortality *Cost of Illness Developed Countries/statistics & numerical data Disabled Persons/statistics & numerical data Female *Health Status Humans Infant *Life Expectancy Male Middle Aged Morbidity Mortality, Premature Risk Factors United States/epidemiology World Health Wounds and Injuries/*mortality"

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between surgery during the initial hospitalization and death or neurodevelopmental impairment of very low-birth-weight infants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of patients enrolled in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network Generic Database from 1998 through 2009 and evaluated at 18 to 22 months' corrected age. Twenty-two academic neonatal intensive care units participated. Inclusion criteria were birth weight 401 to 1500 g, survival to 12 hours, and availability for follow-up. A total of 12 111 infants were included in analyses. EXPOSURES: Surgical procedures; surgery also was classified by expected anesthesia type as major (general anesthesia) or minor (nongeneral anesthesia). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Multivariable logistic regression analyses planned a priori were performed for the primary outcome of death or neurodevelopmental impairment and for the secondary outcome of neurodevelopmental impairment among survivors. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed as planned for the adjusted mean scores of the Mental Developmental Index and Psychomotor Developmental Index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition, for patients born before 2006. RESULTS: A total of 2186 infants underwent major surgery, 784 had minor surgery, and 9141 infants did not undergo surgery. The risk-adjusted odds ratio of death or neurodevelopmental impairment for all surgery patients compared with those who had no surgery was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.08-1.55). For patients who had major surgery compared with those who had no surgery, the risk-adjusted odds ratio of death or neurodevelopmental impairment was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.24-1.87). Patients classified as having minor surgery had no increased adjusted risk. Among survivors who had major surgery compared with those who had no surgery, the adjusted risk of neurodevelopmental impairment was greater and the adjusted mean Bayley scores were lower. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Major surgery in very low-birth-weight infants is independently associated with a greater than 50% increased risk of death or neurodevelopmental impairment and of neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 22 months' corrected age. The role of general anesthesia is implicated but remains unproven.",Missing
24449317,"FDA approval of cardiac implantable electronic devices via original and supplement premarket approval pathways, 1979-2012.",JAMA,Rome BN and Kramer DB and Kesselheim AS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluates high-risk medical devices such as cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), including pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices, via the premarket approval (PMA) process, during which manufacturers submit clinical data demonstrating safety and effectiveness. Subsequent changes to approved high-risk devices are implemented via ""supplements,"" which may not require additional clinical testing. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the prevalence and characteristics of changes to CIEDs made through the PMA supplement process. DESIGN: Using the FDA's PMA database, we reviewed all CIEDs approved as original PMAs or supplements from 1979 through 2012. For each supplement, we collected the date approved, type of supplement (panel-track, 180-day, real-time, special, and 30-day notice), and the nature of the changes. We calculated the number of supplements approved per PMA and analyzed trends relating to different supplement regulatory categories over time. For supplements approved via the 180-day regulatory pathway, which often involve significant design changes, from 2010-2012, we identified how often additional clinical data were collected. RESULTS: From 1979-2012, the FDA approved 77 original and 5829 supplement PMA applications for CIEDs, with a median of 50 supplements per original PMA (interquartile range [IQR], 23-87). Excluding manufacturing changes that do not alter device design, the number of supplements approved each year was stable around a mean (SD) of 2.6 (0.9) supplements per PMA per year. Premarket approvals remained active via successive supplements over a median period of 15 years (IQR, 8-20), and 79% of the 77 original PMAs approved during our study period were the subject of at least 1 supplement in 2012. Thirty-seven percent of approved supplements involved a change to the device's design. Among 180-day supplements approved from 2010-2012, 23% (15/64) included new clinical data to support safety and effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Many CIED models currently used by clinicians were approved via the PMA supplement process, not as original PMAs. Most new device models are deemed safe and effective without requiring new clinical data, reinforcing the importance of rigorous postapproval surveillance of these devices.","*Defibrillators, Implantable/adverse effects/standards Device Approval/*standards Equipment Safety *Pacemaker, Artificial/adverse effects/standards Product Surveillance, Postmarketing United States *United States Food and Drug Administration"

OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of progression to diabetes after islet autoantibody seroconversion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were pooled from prospective cohort studies performed in Colorado (recruitment, 1993-2006), Finland (recruitment, 1994-2009), and Germany (recruitment, 1989-2006) examining children genetically at risk for type 1 diabetes for the development of insulin autoantibodies, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) autoantibodies, insulinoma antigen 2 (IA2) autoantibodies, and diabetes. Participants were all children recruited and followed up in the 3 studies (Colorado, 1962; Finland, 8597; Germany, 2818). Follow-up assessment in each study was concluded by July 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary analysis was the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children with 2 or more autoantibodies. The secondary analysis was the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children with 1 autoantibody or no autoantibodies. RESULTS: Progression to type 1 diabetes at 10-year follow-up after islet autoantibody seroconversion in 585 children with multiple islet autoantibodies was 69.7% (95% CI, 65.1%-74.3%), and in 474 children with a single islet autoantibody was 14.5% (95% CI, 10.3%-18.7%). Risk of diabetes in children who had no islet autoantibodies was 0.4% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.6%) by the age of 15 years. Progression to type 1 diabetes in the children with multiple islet autoantibodies was faster for children who had islet autoantibody seroconversion younger than age 3 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.65 [95% CI, 1.30-2.09; P < .001]; 10-year risk, 74.9% [95% CI, 69.7%-80.1%]) vs children 3 years or older (60.9% [95% CI, 51.5%-70.3%]); for children with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype DR3/DR4-DQ8 (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.09-1.68; P = .007]; 10-year risk, 76.6% [95% CI, 69.2%-84%]) vs other HLA genotypes (66.2% [95% CI, 60.2%-72.2%]); and for girls (HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.04-1.58; P = .02];10-year risk, 74.8% [95% CI, 68.0%-81.6%]) vs boys (65.7% [95% CI, 59.3%-72.1%]).

24089326,Massachusetts health care reform and reduced racial disparities in minimally invasive surgery.,JAMA Surg,Loehrer AP and Song Z and Auchincloss HG and Hutter MM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Racial disparities in receipt of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) persist in the United States and have been shown to also be associated with a number of driving factors, including insurance status. However, little is known as to how expanding insurance coverage across a population influences disparities in surgical care. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of Massachusetts health care reform on racial disparities in MIS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study assessed the probability of undergoing MIS vs an open operation for nonwhite patients in Massachusetts compared with 6 control states. All discharges (n = 167,560) of nonelderly white, black, or Latino patients with government insurance (Medicaid or Commonwealth Care insurance) or no insurance who underwent a procedure for acute appendicitis or acute cholecystitis at inpatient hospitals between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2009, were assessed. Data are from the Hospital Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases. INTERVENTION: The 2006 Massachusetts health care reform, which expanded insurance coverage for government-subsidized, self-pay, and uninsured individuals in Massachusetts. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted probability of undergoing MIS and difference-in-difference estimates. RESULTS: Prior to the 2006 reform, Massachusetts nonwhite patients had a 5.21-percentage point lower probability of MIS relative to white patients (P < .001). Nonwhite patients in control states had a 1.39-percentage point lower probability of MIS (P = .007). After reform, nonwhite patients in Massachusetts had a 3.71-percentage point increase in the probability of MIS relative to concurrent trends in control states (P = .01). After 2006, measured racial disparities in MIS resolved in Massachusetts, with nonwhite patients having equal probability of MIS relative to white patients (0.06 percentage point greater; P = .96). However, nonwhite patients in control states without health care reform have a persistently lower probability of MIS relative to white patients (3.19 percentage points lower; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The 2006 Massachusetts insurance expansion was associated with an increased probability of nonwhite patients undergoing MIS and resolution of measured racial disparities in MIS.","Adult African Americans/statistics & numerical data Cohort Studies European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Female Health Care Reform/economics/*legislation & jurisprudence Health Care Surveys Health Status Disparities Healthcare Disparities/*statistics & numerical data Humans Incidence Insurance Coverage/*economics/legislation & jurisprudence Insurance, Health/economics/legislation & jurisprudence Male Massachusetts Middle Aged Outcome Assessment (Health Care) Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Surgical Procedures, Minimally Invasive/economics/*statistics & numerical data Young Adult"

OBJECTIVE: To study patterns of primary care malpractice types, causes, and outcomes as part of a Massachusetts ambulatory malpractice risk and safety improvement project. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective review of pooled closed claims data of 2 malpractice carriers covering most Massachusetts physicians during a 5-year period (January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009). Data were harmonized between the 2 insurers using a standardized taxonomy. Primary care practices in Massachusetts. All malpractice claims that involved primary care practices insured by the 2 largest insurers in the state were screened. A total of 551 claims from primary care practices were identified for the analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Numbers and types of claims, including whether claims involved primary care physicians or practices; classification of alleged malpractice (eg, misdiagnosis or medication error); patient diagnosis; breakdown in care process; and claim outcome (dismissed, settled, verdict for plaintiff, or verdict for defendant). RESULTS: During a 5-year period there were 7224 malpractice claims of which 551 (7.7%) were from primary care practices. Allegations were related to diagnosis in 397 (72.1%), medications in 68 (12.3%), other medical treatment in 41 (7.4%), communication in 15 (2.7%), patient rights in 11 (2.0%), and patient safety or security in 8 (1.5%). Leading diagnoses were cancer (n = 190), heart diseases (n = 43), blood vessel diseases (n = 27), infections (n = 22), and stroke (n = 16). Primary care cases were significantly more likely to be settled (35.2% vs 20.5%) or result in a verdict for the plaintiff (1.6% vs 0.9%) compared with non-general medical malpractice claims (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In Massachusetts, most primary care claims filed are related to alleged misdiagnosis.

23699867,Gestational influenza and bipolar disorder in adult offspring.,JAMA Psychiatry,Parboosing R and Bao Y and Shen L and Schaefer CA and Brown AS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Gestational influenza has been associated previously with schizophrenia in offspring, but the relationship between this exposure and bipolar disorder (BD) is unclear. The identification of gestational influenza as a risk factor for BD may have potential for preventive approaches. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that maternal influenza during pregnancy is related to BD among offspring. DESIGN: Nested case-control study of a population-based birth cohort from the Child Health and Development Study (CHDS). From January 1, 1959, through December 31, 1966, the CHDS recruited nearly all pregnant women receiving obstetric care from the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Plan, Northern California Region (KPNC). Data on treated maternal influenza from the CHDS were used. Potential cases with BD from the cohort were identified by database linkages of identifiers among the CHDS, Kaiser Permanente database, and a large county health care database; by a mailed questionnaire to the CHDS cohort with subsequent interviews; and from an earlier psychiatric follow-up study on this birth cohort. SETTING: The CHDS, Kaiser Permanente, and county health care databases. PARTICIPANTS: Cases of BD (n = 92) confirmed by structured research interviews and consensus diagnosis among the 214 subjects (48% of those ascertained) who participated and control subjects (n = 722) matched on date of birth, sex, and membership in KPNC or residence in Alameda County. EXPOSURES: Influenza. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Bipolar I or II disorder, BD not otherwise specified, or BD with psychotic features. RESULTS: We found a significant, nearly 4-fold increase in the risk of BD (odds ratio, 3.82 [95% CI, 1.58-9.24; P = .003]) after exposure to maternal influenza at any time during pregnancy. The findings were not confounded by maternal age, race, educational level, gestational age at birth, and maternal psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Maternal influenza may be a risk factor for BD. Although replication is required, the findings suggest that prevention of maternal influenza during pregnancy may reduce the risk of BD.","Adult Bipolar Disorder/*complications/epidemiology California/epidemiology Case-Control Studies Female Gestational Age Humans Influenza, Human/*complications/*congenital/epidemiology Maternal Exposure/adverse effects Models, Biological Odds Ratio Pregnancy *Pregnancy Complications, Infectious Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/psychology/*virology Prevalence Risk Factors"

Obesity increases the risk of preterm delivery, but the associations between overweight and obesity and subtypes of preterm delivery are not clear. OBJECTIVE: To study the associations between early pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and risk of preterm delivery by gestational age and by precursors of preterm delivery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study of women with live singleton births in Sweden from 1992 through 2010. Maternal and pregnancy characteristics were obtained from the nationwide Swedish Medical Birth Register. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risks of preterm deliveries (extremely, 22-27 weeks; very, 28-31 weeks; and moderately, 32-36 weeks). These outcomes were further characterized as spontaneous (related to preterm contractions or preterm premature rupture of membranes) and medically indicated preterm delivery (cesarean delivery before onset of labor or induced onset of labor). Risk estimates were adjusted for maternal age, parity, smoking, education, height, mother's country of birth, and year of delivery. RESULTS: Among 1,599,551 deliveries with information on early pregnancy BMI, 3082 were extremely preterm, 6893 were very preterm, and 67,059 were moderately preterm. Risks of extremely, very, and moderately preterm deliveries increased with BMI and the overweight and obesity-related risks were highest for extremely preterm delivery. Among normal-weight women (BMI 18.5-<25), the rate of extremely preterm delivery was 0.17%. As compared with normal-weight women, rates (%) and adjusted odds ratios (ORs [95% CIs]) of extremely preterm delivery were as follows: BMI 25 to less than 30 (0.21%; OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.15-1.37), BMI 30 to less than 35 (0.27%; OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.39-1.79), BMI 35 to less than 40 (0.35%; OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.66-2.45), and BMI of 40 or greater (0.52%; OR, 2.99; 95% CI, 2.28-3.92). Risk of spontaneous extremely preterm delivery increased with BMI among obese women (BMI>/=30). Risks of medically indicated preterm deliveries increased with BMI among overweight and obese women.

23999612,Maternal posttraumatic stress disorder and depression in pediatric primary care: association with child maltreatment and frequency of child exposure to traumatic events.,JAMA Pediatr,Chemtob CM and Gudino OG and Laraque D,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be associated with increased risk for child maltreatment and child exposure to traumatic events. Exposure to multiple traumatic events is associated with a wide range of adverse health and social outcomes in children. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of probable maternal depression, PTSD, and comorbid PTSD and depression with the risk for child maltreatment and parenting stress and with the number of traumatic events to which preschool children are exposed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational design. We used analysis of variance to determine whether probable maternal psychopathology groups differed on child maltreatment, parenting stress, and children's exposure to traumatic events. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to examine the unique and interactive effects of depression and PTSD severity scores on these outcomes. SETTING: Urban pediatric primary care outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-seven mothers of children aged 3 to 5 years. EXPOSURE: Pediatric primary care visit. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Probable maternal depression and/or PTSD, parenting stress, child exposure to traumatic events, and child maltreatment. RESULTS: Mothers with probable comorbid PTSD and depression reported greater child-directed psychological aggression and physical assault and greater parenting stress. The children of mothers with PTSD (mean number of events the child was exposed to, 5.0) or with comorbid PTSD and depression (3.5 events) experienced more traumatic events than those of mothers with depression (1.2 events) or neither disorder (1.4 events). Severity of depressive symptoms uniquely predicted physical assault and neglect. Symptom scores for PTSD and depression interacted to predict psychological aggression and child exposure to traumatic events. When PTSD symptom severity scores were high, psychological aggression and the number of traumatic events children experienced rose. Depressive symptom severity scores predicted the risk for psychological aggression and exposure to traumatic events only when PTSD symptom severity scores were low. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children of mothers with PTSD are exposed to more traumatic events. Posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with an increased risk for child maltreatment beyond that associated with depression. Screening and intervention for maternal PTSD, in addition to maternal depression, may increase our ability to reduce children's exposure to traumatic stress and maltreatment.","Adult Child Abuse/psychology/*statistics & numerical data Child, Preschool Comorbidity Cross-Sectional Studies Depression/*epidemiology Female Humans Male Mothers/*psychology Primary Health Care Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*epidemiology Stress, Psychological"

However, past research evidences difficulty in disaggregating prenatal environmental influences from genetic and postnatal environmental influences. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring conduct problems among children reared by genetically related mothers and genetically unrelated mothers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The following 3 studies using distinct but complementary research designs were used: The Christchurch Health and Development Study (a longitudinal cohort study that includes biological and adopted children), the Early Growth and Development Study (a longitudinal adoption-at-birth study), and the Cardiff IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) Study (an adoption-at-conception study among genetically related families and genetically unrelated families). Maternal smoking during pregnancy was measured as the mean number of cigarettes per day (0, 1-9, or 10) smoked during pregnancy. Possible covariates were controlled for in the analyses, including child sex, birth weight, race/ethnicity, placement age, and breastfeeding, as well as maternal education and maternal age at birth and family breakdown, parenting practices, and family socioeconomic status. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE: Offspring conduct problems (age range, 4-10 years) reported by parents or teachers using the behavior rating scales by Rutter and Conners, the Child Behavior Checklist and the Children's Behavior Questionnaire Short Form, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. RESULTS: A significant association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring conduct problems was observed among children reared by genetically related mothers and genetically unrelated mothers. Results from a meta-analysis affirmed this pattern of findings across pooled study samples. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings across 3 studies using a complement of genetically sensitive research designs suggest that smoking during pregnancy is a prenatal risk factor for offspring conduct problems when controlling for specific perinatal and postnatal confounding factors.","Adult Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Conduct Disorder/diagnosis/*etiology/*genetics Female Humans Longitudinal Studies Male *Mothers/classification/psychology Pregnancy Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/diagnosis/*etiology/*genetics Prevalence Risk Factors Smoking/*adverse effects"

25089592,Use of medical consultants for hospitalized surgical patients: an observational cohort study.,JAMA Intern Med,Chen LM and Wilk AS and Thumma JR and Birkmeyer JD and Banerjee M,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Payments around episodes of inpatient surgery vary widely among hospitals. As payers move toward bundled payments, understanding sources of variation, including use of medical consultants, is important. OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of medical consultations for hospitalized surgical patients, factors associated with use, and practice variation across hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational retrospective cohort study of fee-for-service Medicare patients undergoing colectomy or total hip replacement (THR) between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2010, at US acute care hospitals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number of inpatient medical consultations. RESULTS: More than half of patients undergoing colectomy (91 684) or THR (339 319) received at least 1 medical consultation while hospitalized (69% and 63%, respectively). Median consultant visits from a medicine physician were 9 (interquartile range [IQR], 4-19) for colectomy and 3 for THR (IQR, 2-5). The likelihood of having at least 1 medical consultation varied widely among hospitals (interquartile range [IQR], 50%-91% for colectomy and 36%-90% for THR). For colectomy, settings associated with greater use included nonteaching (adjusted risk ratio [ARR], 1.14 [95% CI, 1.04-1.26]) and for-profit (ARR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.01-1.20]). Variation in use of medical consultations was greater for colectomy patients without complications (IQR, 47%-79%) compared with those with complications (IQR, 90%-95%). Results stratified by complications were similar for THR. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The use of medical consultations varied widely across hospitals, particularly for surgical patients without complications. Understanding the value of medical consultations will be important as hospitals prepare for bundled payments and strive to enhance efficiency.",Missing
24061277,Growth in medicare expenditures for patients with acute myocardial infarction: a comparison of 1998 through 1999 and 2008.,JAMA Intern Med,Likosky DS and Zhou W and Malenka DJ and Borden WB and Nallamothu BK and Skinner JS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Medicare expenditures continue to grow rapidly, but the reasons are uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To compare expenditures from 1998 through 1999 and 2008 for Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analysis of a random 20% sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries admitted with AMI from 1998 through 1999 (n = 105,074) and a 100% sample for 2008 (n = 212,329). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Per-beneficiary expenditures, standardized for price and adjusted for risk and inflation. Expenditures were measured across 4 periods: overall (index admission to 1 year), index (within the index admission), early (postindex admission to 30 days), and late (31-365 days). RESULTS Compared with the subjects from 1998 through 1999, those in 2008 were older and had more comorbidities but slightly less ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. Although there was a 19.2% decline in the rate of hospitalizations for AMI, overall expenditures per patient increased by 16.5% (absolute difference, $6094). Of the total risk-adjusted increase in expenditures, 25.6% occurred within 30 days (22.0% attributed to the index admission), and 74.4% happened 31 to 365 days after the index admission. Spending per beneficiary within 30 days increased by $1560 (7.5%), and spending between 31 and 365 days increased by $4535 (28.0%). Expenditures for skilled nursing facilities, hospice, home health agency, durable medical equipment, and outpatient care nearly doubled 31 to 365 days after admission. Mortality within 1 year declined from 36.0% in 1998 through 1999 to 31.7% in 2008; of the decline, 3.3% was in the 30 days following admission, and 1.0% was in days 31 to 365. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Between 1998 and 2008, Medicare expenditures per patient with an AMI substantially increased, with about three-fourths of the increase in expenditures occurring 31 to 365 days after the date of hospital admission. Although current bundled payment models may contain expenditures within 30 days of an AMI, they do not contain spending beyond 30 days.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cross-Sectional Studies Fee-for-Service Plans/*economics Female *Health Expenditures Hospitalization/economics Humans Male Medicare/*economics Myocardial Infarction/*economics/mortality/therapy Time Factors United States"
24247275,Multifaceted intervention to improve medication adherence and secondary prevention measures after acute coronary syndrome hospital discharge: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA Intern Med,Ho PM and Lambert-Kerzner A and Carey EP and Fahdi IE and Bryson CL and Melnyk SD and Bosworth HB and Radcliff T and Davis R and Mun H and Weaver J and Barnett C and Baron A and Del Giacco EJ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Adherence to cardioprotective medication regimens in the year after hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is poor. OBJECTIVE: To test a multifaceted intervention to improve adherence to cardiac medications. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this randomized clinical trial, 253 patients from 4 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers located in Denver (Colorado), Seattle (Washington); Durham (North Carolina), and Little Rock (Arkansas) admitted with ACS were randomized to the multifaceted intervention (INT) or usual care (UC) prior to discharge. INTERVENTIONS: The INT lasted for 1 year following discharge and comprised (1) pharmacist-led medication reconciliation and tailoring; (2) patient education; (3) collaborative care between pharmacist and a patient's primary care clinician and/or cardiologist; and (4) 2 types of voice messaging (educational and medication refill reminder calls). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome of interest was proportion of patients adherent to medication regimens based on a mean proportion of days covered (PDC) greater than 0.80 in the year after hospital discharge using pharmacy refill data for 4 cardioprotective medications (clopidogrel, beta-blockers, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors [statins], and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers [ACEI/ARB]). Secondary outcomes included achievement of blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level targets. RESULTS Of 253 patients, 241 (95.3%) completed the study (122 in INT and 119 in UC). In the INT group, 89.3% of patients were adherent compared with 73.9% in the UC group (P = .003). Mean PDC was higher in the INT group (0.94 vs 0.87; P< .001). A greater proportion of intervention patients were adherent to clopidogrel (86.8% vs 70.7%; P = .03), statins (93.2% vs 71.3%; P < .001), and ACEI/ARB (93.1% vs 81.7%; P = .03) but not beta-blockers (88.1% vs 84.8%; P = .59). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients who achieved BP and LDL-C level goals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A multifaceted intervention comprising pharmacist-led medication reconciliation and tailoring, patient education, collaborative care between pharmacist and patients' primary care clinician and/or cardiologist, and voice messaging increased adherence to medication regimens in the year after ACS hospital discharge without improving BP and LDL-C levels. Understanding the impact of such improvement in adherence on clinical outcomes is needed prior to broader dissemination of the program.

OBJECTIVES: To determine primarily whether tadalafil preserved erectile function in men treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer, and secondarily to determine whether participant- or partner-reported overall sexual function and sexual and marital satisfaction were affected. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Stratified, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study with 1:1 randomization at 76 community-based and tertiary medical sites in the United States and Canada. Two hundred forty-two participants with intact erectile function scheduled to receive radiotherapy for prostate cancer were recruited between November 2009 and February 2012 with follow-up through March 2013. INTERVENTIONS: One hundred twenty-one participants were assigned 5 mg of tadalafil daily and 121 were assigned placebo for 24 weeks starting with external radiotherapy (63%) or brachytherapy (37%). Participant-reported International Index of Erectile Function response before radiotherapy and at weeks 2 and 4, between weeks 20 and 24, between weeks 28 and 30, and 1 year thereafter. Participants and partners could respond also to the Sexual Adjustment Questionnaire and to the Locke Marital Adjustment Test before radiotherapy, between weeks 20 and 24 and weeks 28 and 30, and at 1 year. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was off-drug spontaneous erectile function 28 to 30 weeks after radiotherapy started. Secondary end points were spontaneous erection at 1 year; overall sexual function and satisfaction; marital adjustment; and partner-reported satisfaction and marital adjustment at 28 to 30 weeks and 1 year, predictors of tadalafil response; and adverse events. RESULTS: Among 221 evaluable participants, 80 (79%; 95% CI, 70%-88%) assigned to receive tadalafil retained erectile function between weeks 28 and 30 compared with 61 (74%; 95% CI, 63%-85%) assigned to receive placebo (P = .49); an absolute difference of 5% (95% CI, -9% to 19%). A significant difference was also not observed at 1 year (72%; 95% CI, 60%-84% vs 71%; 95% CI, 59%-84%; P = .93). Tadalafil was not associated with significantly improved overall sexual function or satisfaction; a significant difference was not observed in any domain subscale. Partners of men assigned tadalafil noted no significant effect on sexual satisfaction, and marital adjustment was not significantly improved in participants or partners. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among men undergoing radiotherapy for prostate cancer, daily use of tadalafil compared with placebo did not result in improved erectile function. These findings do not support daily use of tadalafil to prevent erectile dysfunction in these patients.

Fluconazole prophylaxis reduces candidiasis, but its effect on mortality and the safety of fluconazole are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fluconazole in preventing death or invasive candidiasis in extremely low-birth-weight infants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: This study was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of fluconazole in premature infants. Infants weighing less than 750 g at birth (N = 361) from 32 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the United States were randomly assigned to receive either fluconazole or placebo twice weekly for 42 days. Surviving infants were evaluated at 18 to 22 months corrected age for neurodevelopmental outcomes. The study was conducted between November 2008 and February 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Fluconazole (6 mg/kg of body weight) or placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was a composite of death or definite or probable invasive candidiasis prior to study day 49 (1 week after completion of study drug). Secondary and safety outcomes included invasive candidiasis, liver function, bacterial infection, length of stay, intracranial hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, chronic lung disease, patent ductus arteriosus requiring surgery, retinopathy of prematurity requiring surgery, necrotizing enterocolitis, spontaneous intestinal perforation, and neurodevelopmental outcomes-defined as a Bayley-III cognition composite score of less than 70, blindness, deafness, or cerebral palsy at 18 to 22 months corrected age. RESULTS: Among infants receiving fluconazole, the composite primary end point of death or invasive candidiasis was 16% (95% CI, 11%-22%) vs 21% in the placebo group (95% CI, 15%-28%; odds ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.43-1.23]; P = .24; treatment difference, -5% [95% CI, -13% to 3%]). Invasive candidiasis occurred less frequently in the fluconazole group (3% [95% CI, 1%-6%]) vs the placebo group (9% [95% CI, 5%-14%]; P = .02; treatment difference, -6% [95% CI, -11% to -1%]). The cumulative incidences of other secondary outcomes were not statistically different between groups. Neurodevelopmental impairment did not differ between the groups (fluconazole, 31% [95% CI, 21%-41%] vs placebo, 27% [95% CI, 18%-37%]; P = .60; treatment difference, 4% [95% CI, -10% to 17%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among infants with a birth weight of less than 750 g, 42 days of fluconazole prophylaxis compared with placebo did not result in a lower incidence of the composite of death or invasive candidiasis. These findings do not support the universal use of prophylactic fluconazole in extremely low-birth-weight infants.

Aleglitazar is a dual agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors with insulin-sensitizing and glucose-lowering actions and favorable effects on lipid profiles. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the addition of aleglitazar to standard medical therapy reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: AleCardio was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 720 hospitals in 26 countries throughout North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions. The enrollment of 7226 patients hospitalized for ACS (myocardial infarction or unstable angina) with type 2 diabetes occurred between February 2010 and May 2012; treatment was planned to continue until patients were followed-up for at least 2.5 years and 950 primary end point events were positively adjudicated. INTERVENTIONS: Randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive aleglitazar 150 microg or placebo daily. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy end point was time to cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Principal safety end points were hospitalization due to heart failure and changes in renal function. RESULTS: The trial was terminated on July 2, 2013, after a median follow-up of 104 weeks, upon recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board due to futility for efficacy at an unplanned interim analysis and increased rates of safety end points. A total of 3.1% of patients were lost to follow-up and 3.2% of patients withdrew consent. The primary end point occurred in 344 patients (9.5%) in the aleglitazar group and 360 patients (10.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.83-1.11]; P = .57). Rates of serious adverse events, including heart failure (3.4% for aleglitazar vs 2.8% for placebo, P = .14), gastrointestinal hemorrhages (2.4% for aleglitazar vs 1.7% for placebo, P = .03), and renal dysfunction (7.4% for aleglitazar vs 2.7% for placebo, P < .001) were increased. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with type 2 diabetes and recent ACS, use of aleglitazar did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular outcomes. These findings do not support the use of aleglitazar in this setting with a goal of reducing cardiovascular risk.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of duloxetine, 60 mg daily, on average pain severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial at 8 National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded cooperative research networks that enrolled 231 patients who were 25 years or older being treated at community and academic settings between April 2008 and March 2011. Study follow-up was completed July 2012. Stratified by chemotherapeutic drug and comorbid pain risk, patients were randomized to receive either duloxetine followed by placebo or placebo followed by duloxetine. Eligibility required that patients have grade 1 or higher sensory neuropathy according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and at least 4 on a scale of 0 to 10, representing average chemotherapy-induced pain, after paclitaxel, other taxane, or oxaliplatin treatment. INTERVENTIONS: The initial treatment consisted of taking 1 capsule daily of either 30 mg of duloxetine or placebo for the first week and 2 capsules of either 30 mg of duloxetine or placebo daily for 4 additional weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary hypothesis was that duloxetine would be more effective than placebo in decreasing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain. Pain severity was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form ""average pain"" item with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing as bad as can be imagined. RESULTS: Individuals receiving duloxetine as their initial 5-week treatment reported a mean decrease in average pain of 1.06 (95% CI, 0.72-1.40) vs 0.34 (95% CI, 0.01-0.66) among those who received placebo (P = .003; effect size, 0.513). The observed mean difference in the average pain score between duloxetine and placebo was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.26-1.20). Fifty-nine percent of those initially receiving duloxetine vs 38% of those initially receiving placebo reported decreased pain of any amount. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, the use of duloxetine compared with placebo for 5 weeks resulted in a greater reduction in pain.

24756514,Effect of acetazolamide on visual function in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and mild visual loss: the idiopathic intracranial hypertension treatment trial.,JAMA,Wall M and McDermott MP and Kieburtz KD and Corbett JJ and Feldon SE and Friedman DI and Katz DM and Keltner JL and Schron EB and Kupersmith MJ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Acetazolamide is commonly used to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), but there is insufficient information to establish an evidence base for its use. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether acetazolamide is beneficial in improving vision when added to a low-sodium weight reduction diet in patients with IIH and mild visual loss. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study of acetazolamide in 165 participants with IIH and mild visual loss who received a low-sodium weight-reduction diet. Participants were enrolled at 38 academic and private practice sites in North America from March 2010 to November 2012 and followed up for 6 months (last visit in June 2013). All participants met the modified Dandy criteria for IIH and had a perimetric mean deviation (PMD) between -2 dB and -7 dB. The mean age was 29 years and all but 4 participants were women. INTERVENTIONS: Low-sodium weight-reduction diet plus the maximally tolerated dosage of acetazolamide (up to 4 g/d) or matching placebo for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The planned primary outcome variable was the change in PMD from baseline to month 6 in the most affected eye, as measured by Humphrey Field Analyzer. Perimetric mean deviation is a measure of global visual field loss (mean deviation from age-corrected normal values), with a range of 2 to -32 dB; larger negative values indicate greater vision loss. Secondary outcome variables included changes in papilledema grade, quality of life (Visual Function Questionnaire 25 [VFQ-25] and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey), headache disability, and weight at month 6. RESULTS: The mean improvement in PMD was greater with acetazolamide (1.43 dB, from -3.53 dB at baseline to -2.10 dB at month 6; n = 86) than with placebo (0.71 dB, from -3.53 dB to -2.82 dB; n = 79); the difference was 0.71 dB (95% CI, 0 to 1.43 dB; P = .050). Mean improvements in papilledema grade (acetazolamide: -1.31, from 2.76 to 1.45; placebo: -0.61, from 2.76 to 2.15; treatment effect, -0.70; 95% CI, -0.99 to -0.41; P < .001) and vision-related quality of life as measured by the National Eye Institute VFQ-25 (acetazolamide: 8.33, from 82.97 to 91.30; placebo: 1.98, from 82.97 to 84.95; treatment effect, 6.35; 95% CI, 2.22 to 10.47; P = .003) and its 10-item neuro-ophthalmic supplement (acetazolamide: 9.82, from 75.45 to 85.27; placebo: 1.59, from 75.45 to 77.04; treatment effect, 8.23; 95% CI, 3.89 to 12.56; P < .001) were also observed with acetazolamide. Participants assigned to acetazolamide also experienced a reduction in weight (acetazolamide: -7.50 kg, from 107.72 kg to 100.22 kg; placebo: -3.45 kg, from 107.72 kg to 104.27 kg; treatment effect, -4.05 kg, 95% CI, -6.27 to -1.83 kg; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with IIH and mild visual loss, the use of acetazolamide with a low-sodium weight-reduction diet compared with diet alone resulted in modest improvement in visual field function. The clinical importance of this improvement remains to be determined.

Postoperative use of colchicine prevented these complications in a single trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of perioperative use of oral colchicine in reducing postpericardiotomy syndrome, postoperative AF, and postoperative pericardial or pleural effusions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Investigator-initiated, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial among 360 consecutive candidates for cardiac surgery enrolled in 11 Italian centers between March 2012 and March 2014. At enrollment, mean age of the trial participants was 67.5 years (SD, 10.6 years), 69% were men, and 36% had planned valvular surgery. Main exclusion criteria were absence of sinus rhythm at enrollment, cardiac transplantation, and contraindications to colchicine. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive placebo (n=180) or colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily in patients >/=70 kg or 0.5 mg once daily in patients <70 kg; n=180) starting between 48 and 72 hours before surgery and continued for 1 month after surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Occurrence of postpericardiotomy syndrome within 3 months; main secondary study end points were postoperative AF and pericardial or pleural effusion. RESULTS: The primary end point of postpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 35 patients (19.4%) assigned to colchicine and in 53 (29.4%) assigned to placebo (absolute difference, 10.0%; 95% CI, 1.1%-18.7%; number needed to treat = 10). There were no significant differences between the colchicine and placebo groups for the secondary end points of postoperative AF (colchicine, 61 patients [33.9%]; placebo, 75 patients [41.7%]; absolute difference, 7.8%; 95% CI, -2.2% to 17.6%) or postoperative pericardial/pleural effusion (colchicine, 103 patients [57.2%]; placebo, 106 patients [58.9%]; absolute difference, 1.7%; 95% CI, -8.5% to 11.7%), although there was a reduction in postoperative AF in the prespecified on-treatment analysis (placebo, 61/148 patients [41.2%]; colchicine, 38/141 patients [27.0%]; absolute difference, 14.2%; 95% CI, 3.3%-24.7%). Adverse events occurred in 21 patients (11.7%) in the placebo group vs 36 (20.0%) in the colchicine group (absolute difference, 8.3%; 95% CI; 0.76%-15.9%; number needed to harm = 12), but discontinuation rates were similar. No serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, perioperative use of colchicine compared with placebo reduced the incidence of postpericardiotomy syndrome but not of postoperative AF or postoperative pericardial/pleural effusion. The increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects reduced the potential benefits of colchicine in this setting.

INTERVENTIONS: Participants (n = 186) were randomized to receive a psychosocial intervention plus either citalopram (n = 94) or placebo (n = 92) for 9 weeks. Dosage began at 10 mg per day with planned titration to 30 mg per day over 3 weeks based on response and tolerability. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were based on scores from the 18-point Neurobehavioral Rating Scale agitation subscale (NBRS-A) and the modified Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (mADCS-CGIC). Other outcomes were based on scores from the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), ability to complete activities of daily living (ADLs), caregiver distress, cognitive safety (based on scores from the 30-point Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE]), and adverse events. RESULTS: Participants who received citalopram showed significant improvement compared with those who received placebo on both primary outcome measures. The NBRS-A estimated treatment difference at week 9 (citalopram minus placebo) was -0.93 (95% CI, -1.80 to -0.06), P = .04. Results from the mADCS-CGIC showed 40% of citalopram participants having moderate or marked improvement from baseline compared with 26% of placebo recipients, with estimated treatment effect (odds ratio [OR] of being at or better than a given CGIC category) of 2.13 (95% CI, 1.23-3.69), P = .01. Participants who received citalopram showed significant improvement on the CMAI, total NPI, and caregiver distress scores but not on the NPI agitation subscale, ADLs, or in less use of rescue lorazepam. Worsening of cognition (-1.05 points; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.13; P = .03) and QT interval prolongation (18.1 ms; 95% CI, 6.1-30.1; P = .01) were seen in the citalopram group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with probable Alzheimer disease and agitation who were receiving psychosocial intervention, the addition of citalopram compared with placebo significantly reduced agitation and caregiver distress; however, cognitive and cardiac adverse effects of citalopram may limit its practical application at the dosage of 30 mg per day.

24567036,Antihypertensive medications and serious fall injuries in a nationally representative sample of older adults.,JAMA Intern Med,Tinetti ME and Han L and Lee DS and McAvay GJ and Peduzzi P and Gross CP and Zhou B and Lin H,Missing,"IMPORTANCE The effect of serious injuries, such as hip fracture and head injury, on mortality and function is comparable to that of cardiovascular events. Concerns have been raised about the risk of fall injuries in older adults taking antihypertensive medications. The low risk of fall injuries reported in clinical trials of healthy older adults may not reflect the risk in older adults with multiple chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE To determine whether antihypertensive medication use was associated with experiencing a serious fall injury in a nationally representative sample of older adults. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND SETTING Competing risk analysis as performed with propensity score adjustment and matching in the nationally representative Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey cohort during a 3-year follow-up through 2009. Participants included 4961 community-living adults older than 70 years with hypertension. EXPOSURES Antihypertensive medication intensity based on the standardized daily dose for each antihypertensive medication class that participants used. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Serious fall injuries, including hip and other major fractures, traumatic brain injuries, and joint dislocations, ascertained through Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services claims. RESULTS Of the 4961 participants, 14.1% received no antihypertensive medications; 54.6% were in the moderate-intensity and 31.3% in the high-intensity antihypertensive groups. During follow-up, 446 participants (9.0%) experienced serious fall injuries, and 837 (16.9%) died. The adjusted hazard ratios for serious fall injury were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.03-1.90) in the moderate-intensity and 1.28 (95% CI, 0.91-1.80) in the high-intensity antihypertensive groups compared with nonusers. Although the difference in adjusted hazard ratios across the groups did not reach statistical significance, results were similar in the propensity score-matched subcohort. Among 503 participants with a previous fall injury, the adjusted hazard ratios were 2.17 (95% CI, 0.98-4.80) for the moderate-intensity and 2.31 (95% CI, 1.01-5.29) for the high-intensity antihypertensive groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Antihypertensive medications were associated with an increased risk of serious fall injuries, particularly among those with previous fall injuries. The potential harms vs benefits of antihypertensive medications should be weighed in deciding to continue treatment with antihypertensive medications in older adults with multiple chronic conditions.","Accidental Falls/*statistics & numerical data Aged Aged, 80 and over Antihypertensive Agents/*adverse effects Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (U.S.) Female Humans Male Propensity Score Risk United States/epidemiology Wounds and Injuries/*epidemiology"

23093164,Associations between conventional cardiovascular risk factors and risk of peripheral artery disease in men.,JAMA,Joosten MM and Pai JK and Bertoia ML and Rimm EB and Spiegelman D and Mittleman MA and Mukamal KJ,harvard,"CONTEXT: Previous studies have examined the associations of individual clinical risk factors with risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD), but the combined effects of these risk factors are largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the degree to which the 4 conventional cardiovascular risk factors of smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes are associated with the risk of PAD among men. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study of 44,985 men in the United States without a history of cardiovascular disease at baseline in 1986; participants in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study were followed up for 25 years until January 2011. The presence of risk factors was updated biennially during follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinically significant PAD defined as limb amputation or revascularization, angiogram reporting vascular obstruction of 50% or greater, ankle-brachial index of less than 0.90, or physician-diagnosed PAD. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 24.2 years (interquartile range, 20.8-24.7 years), there were 537 cases of incident PAD. Each risk factor was significantly and independently associated with a higher risk of PAD after adjustment for the other 3 risk factors and confounders. The age-adjusted incidence rates were 9 (95% CI, 6-14) cases/100,000 person-years (n = 19 incident cases) for 0 risk factors, 23 (95% CI, 18-28) cases/100,000 person-years (n = 99 incident cases) for 1 risk factor, 47 (95% CI, 39-56) cases/100,000 person-years (n = 176 incident cases) for 2 risk factors, 92 (95% CI, 76-111) cases/100,000 person-years (n = 180 incident cases) for 3 risk factors, and 186 (95% CI, 141-246) cases/100,000 person-years (n = 63 incident cases) for 4 risk factors. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for each additional risk factor was 2.06 (95% CI, 1.88-2.26). Men without any of the 4 risk factors had a hazard ratio of PAD of 0.23 (95% CI, 0.14-0.36) compared with all other men in the cohort. In 96% of PAD cases (95% CI, 94%-98%), at least 1 of the 4 risk factors was present at the time of PAD diagnosis. The population-attributable risk associated with these 4 risk factors was 75% (95% CI, 64%-87%). The absolute incidence of PAD among men with all 4 risk factors was 3.5/1000 person-years. CONCLUSION: Among men in this cohort, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes account for the majority of risk associated with development of clinically significant PAD.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology Cohort Studies Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*epidemiology Humans Hypercholesterolemia/*epidemiology Hypertension/*epidemiology Male Middle Aged Peripheral Arterial Disease/*epidemiology Prospective Studies Risk Factors Smoking/*epidemiology United States/epidemiology"
23925620,Risk factors associated with suicide in current and former US military personnel.,JAMA,LeardMann CA and Powell TM and Smith TC and Bell MR and Smith B and Boyko EJ and Hooper TI and Gackstetter GD and Ghamsary M and Hoge CW,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Beginning in 2005, the incidence of suicide deaths in the US military began to sharply increase. Unique stressors, such as combat deployments, have been assumed to underlie the increasing incidence. Previous military suicide studies, however, have relied on case series and cross-sectional investigations and have not linked data during service with postservice periods. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively identify and quantify risk factors associated with suicide in current and former US military personnel including demographic, military, mental health, behavioral, and deployment characteristics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective longitudinal study with accrual and assessment of participants in 2001, 2004, and 2007. Questionnaire data were linked with the National Death Index and the Department of Defense Medical Mortality Registry through December 31, 2008. Participants were current and former US military personnel from all service branches, including active and Reserve/National Guard, who were included in the Millennium Cohort Study (N = 151,560). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Death by suicide captured by the National Death Index and the Department of Defense Medical Mortality Registry. RESULTS: Through the end of 2008, findings were 83 suicides in 707,493 person-years of follow-up (11.73/100,000 person-years [95% CI, 9.21-14.26]). In Cox models adjusted for age and sex, factors significantly associated with increased risk of suicide included male sex, depression, manic-depressive disorder, heavy or binge drinking, and alcohol-related problems. None of the deployment-related factors (combat experience, cumulative days deployed, or number of deployments) were associated with increased suicide risk in any of the models. In multivariable Cox models, individuals with increased risk for suicide were men (hazard ratio [HR], 2.14; 95% CI, 1.17-3.92; P = .01; attributable risk [AR], 3.5 cases/10,000 persons), and those with depression (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.05-3.64; P = .03; AR, 6.9/10,000 persons), manic-depressive disorder (HR, 4.35; 95% CI, 1.56-12.09; P = .005; AR, 35.6/10,000 persons), or alcohol-related problems (HR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.56-4.18; P <.001; AR, 7.7/10,000 persons). A nested, matched case-control analysis using 20:1 control participants per case confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this sample of current and former military personnel observed July 1, 2001-December 31, 2008, suicide risk was independently associated with male sex and mental disorders but not with military-specific variables. These findings may inform approaches to mitigating suicide risk in this population.","Adult Afghan Campaign 2001- Aged Cause of Death Data Collection Female Humans Incidence Iraq War, 2003-2011 Male Mental Disorders/*epidemiology *Mental Health Middle Aged Military Personnel/*psychology Prospective Studies Registries Risk Factors Sex Factors Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology Suicide/*statistics & numerical data Time Factors United States/epidemiology Young Adult"
24554114,Comparison of outcomes of synthetic mesh vs suture repair of elective primary ventral herniorrhaphy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,JAMA Surg,Nguyen MT and Berger RL and Hicks SC and Davila JA and Li LT and Kao LS and Liang MK,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: More than 350,000 ventral hernias are repaired in the United States annually, of which 75% are primary ventral hernias (eg, umbilical or epigastric hernias). Despite the volume, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of sutures vs mesh for primary ventral hernia repairs. OBJECTIVE: To compare suture vs mesh repairs for 3 outcomes: hernia recurrence, surgical site infection (SSI), and seromas. DATA SOURCES: Randomized controlled trials, case-control, and cohort studies were identified from OVID, PubMed, and reference lists from January 1, 1980, through June 1, 2012. STUDY SELECTION: English-language studies with adult patients were eligible for review if there was mention of both suture and mesh techniques used during elective repair of a primary ventral hernia. Two study authors independently reviewed the 1492 articles originally identified and selected 9 for analysis. The Downs and Black 26-item checklist was used to critically assess the risk of bias. DATA EXTRACTION: Year of publication, study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, number of patients, follow-up duration, use of preoperative antibiotics, size of hernias repaired, age, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, repair techniques, incidence of hernia recurrence, seroma, and SSI. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Three separate univariate meta-analyses for each end point followed by a multivariate meta-analysis were performed. Across all 9 studies, there were 637 mesh repairs and 1145 suture repairs. The pooled mesh repairs demonstrated a 2.7% recurrence rate, 7.7% seroma rate, and 7.3% SSI rate The pooled suture repairs demonstrated an 8.2% recurrence rate, 3.8% seroma rate, and 6.6% SSI rate. On the basis of results from the multivariate meta-analysis, recurrences (log odds ratio , -1.04; 95% CI, -1.58 to -0.52) were more common with suture repair, whereas seromas (0.84; 0.27-1.41) and SSIs (0.65; 0.12-1.18) were more common with mesh repair. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mesh repair has a small reduction in recurrence rates compared with suture repairs for primary ventral hernias, but an increased risk of seroma and SSI was observed. Further high-quality studies are necessary to determine whether suture or mesh repair leads to improved outcomes for primary ventral hernias.","Adult Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies Hernia, Ventral/*surgery Herniorrhaphy Humans Outcome Assessment (Health Care)/statistics & numerical data Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/prevention & control Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data Recurrence/prevention & control *Surgical Mesh *Suture Techniques"
23429927,Cochlear implantation in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Gaylor JM and Raman G and Chung M and Lee J and Rao M and Lau J and Poe DS,bu,"IMPORTANCE: Sensorineural hearing loss is the third leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide. Cochlear implants may provide a viable alternative to hearing aids for this type of hearing loss. The Coverage and Analysis Group at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services was interested in an evaluation of recently published literature on this topic. In addition, this meta-analysis is to our knowledge the first to evaluate quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes in adults with cochlear implants. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the communication-related outcomes and health-related QOL outcomes after unilateral or bilateral cochlear implantation in adults with sensorineural hearing loss. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and previous reports from January 1, 2004, through May 31, 2012. STUDY SELECTION: Published studies of adult patients undergoing unilateral or bilateral procedures with multichannel cochlear implants and assessments using open-set sentence tests, multisyllable word tests, or QOL measures. DATA EXTRACTION: Five researchers extracted information on population characteristics, outcomes of interest, and study design and assessed the studies for risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. RESULTS: A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most unilateral implant studies showed a statistically significant improvement in mean speech scores as measured by open-set sentence or multisyllable word tests; meta-analysis revealed a significant improvement in QOL after unilateral implantation. Results from studies assessing bilateral implantation showed improvement in communication-related outcomes compared with unilateral implantation and additional improvements in sound localization compared with unilateral device use or implantation only. Based on a few studies, the QOL outcomes varied across tests after bilateral implantation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Unilateral cochlear implants provide improved hearing and significantly improve QOL, and improvements in sound localization are noted for bilateral implantation. Future studies of longer duration, higher-quality reporting, and large databases or registries of patients with long-term follow-up data are needed to yield stronger evidence.","Adult *Cochlear Implants Hearing Loss, Sensorineural/*rehabilitation Humans *Quality of Life Sound Localization Speech Perception"

In animal experimental studies metformin preserves left ventricular function. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of metformin treatment on preservation of left ventricular function in patients without diabetes presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted among 380 patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI at the University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands, between January 1, 2011, and May 26, 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Metformin hydrochloride (500 mg) (n = 191) or placebo (n = 189) twice daily for 4 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy measure was left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after 4 months, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. A secondary efficacy measure was the N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration after 4 months. The incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE; the combined end point of death, reinfarction, or target-lesion revascularization) was recorded until 4 months as a secondary efficacy measure. RESULTS: At 4 months, all patients were alive and none were lost to follow-up. LVEF was 53.1% (95% CI, 51.6%-54.6%) in the metformin group (n = 135), compared with 54.8% (95% CI, 53.5%-56.1%) (P = .10) in the placebo group (n = 136). NT-proBNP concentration was 167 ng/L in the metformin group (interquartile range [IQR], 65-393 ng/L) and 167 ng/L in the placebo group (IQR, 74-383 ng/L) (P = .66). MACE were observed in 6 patients (3.1%) in the metformin group and in 2 patients (1.1%) in the placebo group (P = .16). Creatinine concentration (79 micromol/L [IQR, 70-87 micromol/L] vs 79 micromol/L [IQR, 72-89 micromol/L], P = .61) and glycated hemoglobin (5.9% [IQR, 5.6%-6.1%] vs 5.9% [IQR, 5.7%-6.1%], P = .15) were not significantly different between both groups. No cases of lactic acidosis were observed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients without diabetes presenting with STEMI and undergoing primary PCI, the use of metformin compared with placebo did not result in improved LVEF after 4 months. The present findings do not support the use of metformin in this setting.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency and duration of concussions in female youth soccer players and to determine if concussions result in stopping play and seeking medical care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study from March 2008 through May 2012 among 4 soccer clubs from the Puget Sound region of Washington State, involving 351 elite female soccer players, aged 11 to 14 years, from 33 randomly selected youth soccer teams. Of the players contacted, 83.1% participated and 92.4% completed the study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Concussion cumulative incidence, incidence rate, and description of the number, type, and duration of symptoms. We inquired weekly about concussion symptoms and, if present, the symptom type and duration, the event resulting in symptom onset, and whether the player sought medical attention or played while symptomatic. RESULTS: Among the 351 soccer players, there were 59 concussions with 43 742 athletic exposure hours. Cumulative concussion incidence was 13.0% per season, and the incidence rate was 1.2 per 1000 athletic exposure hours (95% CI, 0.9-1.6). Symptoms lasted a median of 4.0 days (mean, 9.4 days). Heading the ball accounted for 30.5% of concussions. Players with the following symptoms had a longer recover time than players without these symptoms: light sensitivity (16.0 vs 3.0 days, P = .001), emotional lability (15.0 vs 3.5 days, P = .002), noise sensitivity (12.0 vs 3.0 days, P = .004), memory loss (9.0 vs 4.0 days, P = .04), nausea (9.0 vs 3.0 days, P = .02), and concentration problems (7.0 vs 2.0 days, P = .02). Most players (58.6%) continued to play with symptoms, with almost half (44.1%) seeking medical attention. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Concussion rates in young female soccer players are greater than those reported in older age groups, and most of those concussed report playing with symptoms. Heading the ball is a frequent precipitating event.

Migraine is a common cause of headache pain in childhood. Whether there is an association between these 2 types of pain in unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate a possible association between infantile colic and migraines in childhood. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A case-control study of 208 consecutive children aged 6 to 18 years presenting to the emergency department and diagnosed as having migraines in 3 European tertiary care hospitals between April 2012 and June 2012. The control group was composed of 471 children in the same age range who visited the emergency department of each participating center for minor trauma during the same period. A structured questionnaire identified personal history of infantile colic for case and control participants, confirmed by health booklets. A second study of 120 children diagnosed with tension-type headaches was done to test the specificity of the association. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Difference in the prevalence of infantile colic between children with and without a diagnosis of migraine. RESULTS: Children with migraine were more likely to have experienced infantile colic than those without migraine (72.6% vs 26.5%; odds ratio [OR], 6.61 [95% CI, 4.38-10.00]; P < .001), either migraine without aura (n = 142; 73.9% vs 26.5%; OR, 7.01 [95% CI, 4.43-11.09]; P < .001), or migraine with aura (n = 66; 69.7% vs 26.5%; OR, 5.73 [95% CI, 3.07-10.73]; P < .001).

OBJECTIVE: To examine the course of MCI and its progression to dementia in an incident PD cohort. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: The Norwegian ParkWest study, an ongoing population-based study of the incidence, neurobiology, and prognosis of PD in western and southern Norway. PARTICIPANTS: A population-based cohort of 182 patients with incident PD monitored for 3 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Serial neuropsychological tests of attention, executive function, verbal memory, and visuospatial skills were administered at baseline, 1 year, and 3 years. Patients were classified as having MCI and received a diagnosis of dementia according to published consensus criteria. RESULTS: Significantly more patients with MCI than without MCI at baseline (10 of 37 [27.0%] vs 1 of 145 [0.7%]; relative risk, 39.2 [95% CI, 5.2-296.5]; P < .001) progressed to dementia during follow-up. Of those with MCI at baseline, 8 of 37 (21.6%) had MCI that reverted to normal cognition during follow-up. Mild cognitive impairment at the 1-year visit was associated with a similar progression rate to dementia (10 of 36 patients [27.8%]) and reversion rate to normal cognition (7 of 36 [19.4%]). However, among the 22 patients with persistent MCI at baseline and the 1-year visit, 10 (45.5%) developed dementia and only 2 (9.1%) had MCI that reverted to normal cognition by the end of study. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mild cognitive impairment at PD diagnosis predicts a highly increased risk for early dementia. Repeated neuropsychological testing increases the prognostic accuracy of MCI with respect to early dementia development in PD.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Dementia/*diagnosis/etiology Disease Progression Female Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Mild Cognitive Impairment/*diagnosis/etiology Neuropsychological Tests Norway Parkinson Disease/complications/epidemiology/*physiopathology Prognosis Prospective Studies Time Factors"

However it remains to be determined whether fundamental differences may exist between blast-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) and TBI due to other mechanisms. OBJECTIVES: To determine similarities and differences between clinical outcomes in US military personnel with blast-related vs. non-blast-related concussive TBI and to identify the specific domains of impairment that best correlate with overall disability. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study involving active duty US Military personnel evacuated from Iraq or Afghanistan to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, in Landstuhl, Germany. Four groups of participants were enrolled from 2010 to 2013: (1) blast plus impact complex TBI (n=53), (2) non-blast related TBI with injury due to other mechanisms (n=29), (3) blast-exposed controls evacuated for other medical reasons (n=27) (4) non-blast-exposed controls evacuated for other medical reasons (n=69). All patients with TBI met Department of Defense criteria for concussive (mild) TBI. The study participants were evaluated 6-12 months after injury at Washington University in St Louis. In total, 255 subjects were enrolled in the study, and 183 participated in follow-up evaluations, 5 of whom were disqualified. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-person clinical examinations included evaluation for overall disability, a standardized neurological exam, headache questionnaires, neuropsychological test battery, combat exposure and alcohol use surveys, and structured interview evaluations for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. RESULTS: Global outcomes, headache severity, neuropsychological performance, and surprisingly even PTSD severity and depression were indistinguishable between the two TBI groups, independent of mechanism of injury. Both TBI groups had higher rates of moderate to severe overall disability than the respective control groups: 41/53 (77%) of blast plus impact TBI and 23/29 (79%) of nonblast TBI vs. 16/27 (59%) of blast-exposed controls and 28/69 (41%) of non-blast-exposed controls. In addition, blast-exposed controls had worse headaches and more severe PTSD than non-blast-exposed controls. Self-reported combat exposure intensity was higher in the blast plus impact TBI group than in nonblast TBI group and was higher in blast-exposed controls than in non-blast-exposed controls. However, combat exposure intensity did not correlate with PTSD severity in the TBI groups, but a modest positive correlation was observed in the controls. Overall outcomes were most strongly correlated with depression, headache severity, and number of abnormalities on neuropsychological testing. However a substantial fraction of the variance in overall outcome was not explained by any of the assessed measures. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: One potential interpretation of these results is that TBI itself, independent of injury mechanism and combat exposure intensity, is a primary driver of adverse outcomes.

23780457,Effects of the live attenuated measles-mumps-rubella booster vaccination on disease activity in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a randomized trial.,JAMA,Heijstek MW and Kamphuis S and Armbrust W and Swart J and Gorter S and de Vries LD and Smits GP and van Gageldonk PG and Berbers GA and Wulffraat NM,umcutrecht,"IMPORTANCE: The immunogenicity and the effects of live attenuated measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination on disease activity in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) are matters of concern, especially in patients treated with immunocompromising therapies. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether MMR booster vaccination affects disease activity and to describe MMR booster immunogenicity in patients with JIA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, multicenter, open-label clinical equivalence trial including 137 patients with JIA aged 4 to 9 years who were recruited from 5 academic hospitals in The Netherlands between May 2008 and July 2011. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive MMR booster vaccination (n=68) or no vaccination (control group; n=69). Among patients taking biologics, these treatments were discontinued at 5 times their half-lives prior to vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Disease activity as measured by the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS-27), ranging from 0 (no activity) to 57 (high activity). Disease activity in the year following randomization was compared between revaccinated patients and controls using a linear mixed model. A difference in JADAS-27 of 2.0 was the equivalence margin. Primary immunogenicity outcomes were seroprotection rates and MMR-specific antibody concentrations at 3 and 12 months. RESULTS: Of 137 randomized patients, 131 were analyzed in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, including 60 using methotrexate and 15 using biologics. Disease activity during complete follow-up did not differ between 63 revaccinated patients (JADAS-27, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.1-3.5) and 68 controls (JADAS-27, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7-3.1), with a difference of 0.4 (95% CI, -0.5 to 1.2), within the equivalence margin of 2.0. At 12 months, seroprotection rates were higher in revaccinated patients vs controls (measles, 100% vs 92% [95% CI, 84%-99%]; mumps, 97% [95% CI, 95%-100%] vs 81% [95% CI, 72%-93%]; and rubella, 100% vs 94% [95% CI, 86%-100%], respectively), as were antibody concentrations against measles (1.63 vs 0.78 IU/mL; P = .03), mumps (168 vs 104 RU/mL; P = .03), and rubella (69 vs 45 IU/mL; P = .01). Methotrexate and biologics did not affect humoral responses, but low patient numbers precluded definite conclusions. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among children with JIA who had undergone primary immunization, MMR booster vaccination compared with no booster did not result in worse JIA disease activity and was immunogenic. Larger studies are needed to assess MMR effects in patients using biologic agents.

24866862,Effect of structured physical activity on prevention of major mobility disability in older adults: the LIFE study randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Pahor M and Guralnik JM and Ambrosius WT and Blair S and Bonds DE and Church TS and Espeland MA and Fielding RA and Gill TM and Groessl EJ and King AC and Kritchevsky SB and Manini TM and McDermott MM and Miller ME and Newman AB and Rejeski WJ and Sink KM and Williamson JD,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: In older adults reduced mobility is common and is an independent risk factor for morbidity, hospitalization, disability, and mortality. Limited evidence suggests that physical activity may help prevent mobility disability; however, there are no definitive clinical trials examining whether physical activity prevents or delays mobility disability. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that a long-term structured physical activity program is more effective than a health education program (also referred to as a successful aging program) in reducing the risk of major mobility disability. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study was a multicenter, randomized trial that enrolled participants between February 2010 and December 2011, who participated for an average of 2.6 years. Follow-up ended in December 2013. Outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention assignment. Participants were recruited from urban, suburban, and rural communities at 8 centers throughout the United States. We randomized a volunteer sample of 1635 sedentary men and women aged 70 to 89 years who had physical limitations, defined as a score on the Short Physical Performance Battery of 9 or below, but were able to walk 400 m. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to a structured, moderate-intensity physical activity program (n = 818) conducted in a center (twice/wk) and at home (3-4 times/wk) that included aerobic, resistance, and flexibility training activities or to a health education program (n = 817) consisting of workshops on topics relevant to older adults and upper extremity stretching exercises. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was major mobility disability objectively defined by loss of ability to walk 400 m. RESULTS: Incident major mobility disability occurred in 30.1% (246 participants) of the physical activity group and 35.5% (290 participants) of the health education group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82 [95% CI, 0.69-0.98], P = .03).Persistent mobility disability was experienced by 120 participants (14.7%) in the physical activity group and 162 participants (19.8%) in the health education group (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.57-0.91]; P = .006). Serious adverse events were reported by 404 participants (49.4%) in the physical activity group and 373 participants (45.7%) in the health education group (risk ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98-1.20]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A structured, moderate-intensity physical activity program compared with a health education program reduced major mobility disability over 2.6 years among older adults at risk for disability. These findings suggest mobility benefit from such a program in vulnerable older adults.

24825642,Effect of evolocumab or ezetimibe added to moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy on LDL-C lowering in patients with hypercholesterolemia: the LAPLACE-2 randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Robinson JG and Nedergaard BS and Rogers WJ and Fialkow J and Neutel JM and Ramstad D and Somaratne R and Legg JC and Nelson P and Scott R and Wasserman SM and Weiss R,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: In phase 2 studies, evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, reduced LDL-C levels in patients receiving statin therapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of evolocumab when used in combination with a moderate- vs high-intensity statin. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Phase 3, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and ezetimibe-controlled study conducted between January and December of 2013 in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia at 198 sites in 17 countries. INTERVENTIONS: Patients (n = 2067) were randomized to 1 of 24 treatment groups in 2 steps. Patients were initially randomized to a daily, moderate-intensity (atorvastatin [10 mg], simvastatin [40 mg], or rosuvastatin [5 mg]) or high-intensity (atorvastatin [80 mg], rosuvastatin [40 mg]) statin. After a 4-week lipid-stabilization period, patients (n = 1899) were randomized to compare evolocumab (140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly) with placebo (every 2 weeks or monthly) or ezetimibe (10 mg or placebo daily; atorvastatin patients only) when added to statin therapies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 and at week 12. RESULTS: Evolocumab reduced LDL-C levels by 66% (95% CI, 58% to 73%) to 75% (95% CI, 65% to 84%) (every 2 weeks) and by 63% (95% CI, 54% to 71%) to 75% (95% CI, 67% to 83%) (monthly) vs placebo at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 in the moderate- and high-intensity statin-treated groups; the LDL-C reductions at week 12 were comparable. For moderate-intensity statin groups, evolocumab every 2 weeks reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 115 to 124 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 39 to 49 mg/dL; monthly evolocumab reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 123 to 126 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 43 to 48 mg/dL. For high-intensity statin groups, evolocumab every 2 weeks reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 89 to 94 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 35 to 38 mg/dL; monthly evolocumab reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 89 to 94 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 33 to 35 mg/dL. Adverse events were reported in 36%, 40%, and 39% of evolocumab-, ezetimibe-, and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common adverse events in evolocumab-treated patients were back pain, arthralgia, headache, muscle spasms, and pain in extremity (all <2%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this 12-week trial conducted among patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia, evolocumab added to moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy resulted in additional LDL-C lowering. Further studies are needed to evaluate the longer-term clinical outcomes and safety of this approach for LDL-C lowering.

24841449,Physical activity and sedentary behaviors associated with risk of progression from gestational diabetes mellitus to type 2 diabetes mellitus: a prospective cohort study.,JAMA Intern Med,Bao W and Tobias DK and Bowers K and Chavarro J and Vaag A and Grunnet LG and Strom M and Mills J and Liu A and Kiely M and Zhang C,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at substantially increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The identification of important modifiable factors could help prevent T2DM in this high-risk population. OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of physical activity and television watching and other sedentary behaviors, and changes in these behaviors in the progression from GDM to T2DM. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study of 4554 women from the Nurses' Health Study II who had a history of GDM, as part of the ongoing Diabetes & Women's Health Study. These women were followed up from 1991 to 2007. EXPOSURES: Physical activity and television watching and other sedentary behaviors were assessed in 1991, 1997, 2001, and 2005. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE: Incident T2DM identified through self-report and confirmed by supplemental questionnaires. RESULTS: We documented 635 incident T2DM cases during 59,287 person-years of follow-up. Each 5-metabolic equivalent hours per week (MET-h/wk) increment of total physical activity, which is equivalent to 100 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity, was related to a 9% lower risk of T2DM (adjusted relative risk [RR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.94); this inverse association remained significant after additional adjustment for body mass index (BMI). Moreover, an increase in physical activity was associated with a lower risk of developing T2DM. Compared with women who maintained their total physical activity levels, women who increased their total physical activity levels by 7.5 MET-h/wk or more (equivalent to 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity) had a 47% lower risk of T2DM (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38-0.75); the association remained significant after additional adjustment for BMI. The multivariable adjusted RRs (95% CIs) for T2DM associated with television watching of 0 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 20, and 20 or more hours per week were 1 (reference), 1.28 (1.04-1.59), 1.41 (1.11-1.79), and 1.77 (1.28-2.45), respectively (P value for trend <.001); additional adjustment for BMI attenuated the association. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Increasing physical activity may lower the risk of progression from GDM to T2DM. These findings suggest a hopeful message to women with a history of GDM, although they are at exceptionally high risk for T2DM, promoting an active lifestyle may lower the risk.","Adult Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*epidemiology/etiology Diabetes, Gestational/*epidemiology *Exercise Female Humans Pregnancy Prospective Studies Risk Factors *Sedentary Lifestyle Television/statistics & numerical data United States/epidemiology"
23467753,Firearm legislation and firearm-related fatalities in the United States.,JAMA Intern Med,Fleegler EW and Lee LK and Monuteaux MC and Hemenway D and Mannix R,harvard,"IMPORTANCE: Over 30,000 people die annually in the United States from injuries caused by firearms. Although most firearm laws are enacted by states, whether the laws are associated with rates of firearm deaths is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether more firearm laws in a state are associated with fewer firearm fatalities. DESIGN: Using an ecological and cross-sectional method, we retrospectively analyzed all firearm-related deaths reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System from 2007 through 2010. We used state-level firearm legislation across 5 categories of laws to create a ""legislative strength score,"" and measured the association of the score with state mortality rates using a clustered Poisson regression. States were divided into quartiles based on their score. SETTING: Fifty US states. PARTICIPANTS: Populations of all US states. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were state-level firearm-related fatalities per 100,000 individuals per year overall, for suicide, and for homicide. In various models, we controlled for age, sex, race/ethnicity, poverty, unemployment, college education, population density, nonfirearm violence-related deaths, and household firearm ownership. RESULTS: Over the 4-year study period, there were 121,084 firearm fatalities. The average state-based firearm fatality rates varied from a high of 17.9 (Louisiana) to a low of 2.9 (Hawaii) per 100,000 individuals per year. Annual firearm legislative strength scores ranged from 0 (Utah) to 24 (Massachusetts) of 28 possible points. States in the highest quartile of legislative strength (scores of >/=9) had a lower overall firearm fatality rate than those in the lowest quartile (scores of </=2) (absolute rate difference, 6.64 deaths/100,000/y; age-adjusted incident rate ratio [IRR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37-0.92). Compared with the quartile of states with the fewest laws, the quartile with the most laws had a lower firearm suicide rate (absolute rate difference, 6.25 deaths/100,000/y; IRR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48-0.83) and a lower firearm homicide rate (absolute rate difference, 0.40 deaths/100,000/y; IRR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38-0.95). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A higher number of firearm laws in a state are associated with a lower rate of firearm fatalities in the state, overall and for suicides and homicides individually.

Because people with a first primary melanoma are known to have an increased risk of being diagnosed with another, evidence for prognosis is needed. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether survival after diagnosis was better in patients with MPMs than with SPMs, as suggested in a recent study. DESIGN Survival analysis with median follow-up of 7.6 (range, 0.4-10.6) years. SETTING: The Genes, Environment, and Melanoma Study enrolled incident cases of melanoma from population-based cancer registries in Australia, Canada, Italy, and the United States. Multiple primary melanomas were ascertained during a longer period than SPM. PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand three hundred seventy-two patients with SPM and 1206 with MPM. EXPOSURE: Diagnosis with melanoma. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Melanoma-specific fatality hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals associated with clinical and pathological characteristics of SPM, MPM, and both in Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: Melanoma thickness was the main determinant of fatality (HR for >4 mm, 7.68 [95% CI, 4.46-13.23]); other independent predictors were ulceration, mitoses, and scalp location. After adjustment for these other predictors, we found little difference in fatality between MPM and SPM (HR for MPM relative to SPM, 1.24 [95% CI, 0.91-1.69; P = .18]). Thicker SPM, however, had higher fatality (HR for >4 mm, 13.56 [95% CI, 6.47-28.40]) than thicker MPM (2.93 [1.17-7.30]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although overall fatalities due to SPM and MPM were similar, relative fatality for thicker SPM was greater than that for thicker MPM. This finding may offer support for a difference in outcome between patients with SPM and MPM related to factors other than closer surveillance and earlier diagnosis. The better outcomes are worth further exploration.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Child Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Melanoma/*pathology Middle Aged Neoplasm Staging Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*pathology Prognosis Proportional Hazards Models Registries Skin Neoplasms/*pathology Survival Analysis Survival Rate Young Adult"
23549583,"Mortality rates for Medicare beneficiaries admitted to critical access and non-critical access hospitals, 2002-2010.",JAMA,Joynt KE and Orav EJ and Jha AK,partners,"IMPORTANCE: Critical access hospitals (CAHs) provide inpatient care to Americans living in rural communities. These hospitals are at high risk of falling behind with respect to quality improvement, owing to their limited resources and vulnerable patient populations. How they have fared on patient outcomes during the past decade is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate trends in mortality for patients receiving care at CAHs and compare these trends with those for patients receiving care at non-CAHs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective observational study using data from Medicare fee-for-service patients admitted to US acute care hospitals with acute myocardial infarction (1,902,586 admissions), congestive heart failure (4,488,269 admissions), and pneumonia (3,891,074 admissions) between 2002 and 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trends in risk-adjusted 30-day mortality rates for CAHs and other acute care US hospitals. RESULTS: Accounting for differences in patient, hospital, and community characteristics, CAHs had mortality rates comparable with those of non-CAHs in 2002 (composite mortality across all 3 conditions, 12.8% vs 13.0%; difference, -0.3% [95% CI, -0.7% to 0.2%]; P = .25). Between 2002 and 2010, mortality rates increased 0.1% per year in CAHs but decreased 0.2% per year in non-CAHs, for an annual difference in change of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.2% to 0.3%; P < .001). Thus, by 2010, CAHs had higher mortality rates compared with non-CAHs (13.3% vs 11.4%; difference, 1.8% [95% CI, 1.4% to 2.2%]; P < .001). The patterns were similar when each individual condition was examined separately. Comparing CAHs with other small, rural hospitals, similar patterns were found. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among Medicare beneficiaries with acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or pneumonia, 30-day mortality rates for those admitted to CAHs, compared with those admitted to other acute care hospitals, increased from 2002 to 2010.

23093165,Empirical evaluation of very large treatment effects of medical interventions.,JAMA,Pereira TV and Horwitz RI and Ioannidis JP,Missing,"CONTEXT: Most medical interventions have modest effects, but occasionally some clinical trials may find very large effects for benefits or harms. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency and features of very large effects in medicine. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR, 2010, issue 7). STUDY SELECTION: We separated all binary-outcome CDSR forest plots with comparisons of interventions according to whether the first published trial, a subsequent trial (not the first), or no trial had a nominally statistically significant (P < .05) very large effect (odds ratio [OR], >/=5). We also sampled randomly 250 topics from each group for further in-depth evaluation. DATA EXTRACTION: We assessed the types of treatments and outcomes in trials with very large effects, examined how often large-effect trials were followed up by other trials on the same topic, and how these effects compared against the effects of the respective meta-analyses. RESULTS: Among 85,002 forest plots (from 3082 reviews), 8239 (9.7%) had a significant very large effect in the first published trial, 5158 (6.1%) only after the first published trial, and 71,605 (84.2%) had no trials with significant very large effects. Nominally significant very large effects typically appeared in small trials with median number of events: 18 in first trials and 15 in subsequent trials. Topics with very large effects were less likely than other topics to address mortality (3.6% in first trials, 3.2% in subsequent trials, and 11.6% in no trials with significant very large effects) and were more likely to address laboratory-defined efficacy (10% in first trials,10.8% in subsequent, and 3.2% in no trials with significant very large effects). First trials with very large effects were as likely as trials with no very large effects to have subsequent published trials. Ninety percent and 98% of the very large effects observed in first and subsequently published trials, respectively, became smaller in meta-analyses that included other trials; the median odds ratio decreased from 11.88 to 4.20 for first trials, and from 10.02 to 2.60 for subsequent trials. For 46 of the 500 selected topics (9.2%; first and subsequent trials) with a very large-effect trial, the meta-analysis maintained very large effects with P < .001 when additional trials were included, but none pertained to mortality-related outcomes. Across the whole CDSR, there was only 1 intervention with large beneficial effects on mortality, P < .001, and no major concerns about the quality of the evidence (for a trial on extracorporeal oxygenation for severe respiratory failure in newborns). CONCLUSIONS: Most large treatment effects emerge from small studies, and when additional trials are performed, the effect sizes become typically much smaller. Well-validated large effects are uncommon and pertain to nonfatal outcomes.","*Data Interpretation, Statistical Empirical Research Meta-Analysis as Topic Odds Ratio *Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Sample Size *Treatment Outcome"
24424573,Commercialism in US elementary and secondary school nutrition environments: trends from 2007 to 2012.,JAMA Pediatr,Terry-McElrath YM and Turner L and Sandoval A and Johnston LD and Chaloupka FJ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Schools present highly desirable marketing environments for food and beverage companies. However, most marketed items are nutritionally poor. OBJECTIVE: To examine national trends in student exposure to selected school-based commercialism measures from 2007 through 2012. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Annual nationally representative cross-sectional studies were evaluated in US public elementary, middle, and high schools with use of a survey of school administrators. EXPOSURES: School-based commercialism, including exclusive beverage contracts and associated incentives, profits, and advertising; corporate food vending and associated incentives and profits; posters/advertisements for soft drinks, fast food, or candy; use of food coupons as incentives; event sponsorships; and fast food available to students. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes over time in school-based commercialism as well as differences by student body racial/ethnic distribution and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Although some commercialism measures-especially those related to beverage vending-have shown significant decreases over time, most students at all academic levels continued to attend schools with one or more types of school-based commercialism in 2012. Overall, exposure to school-based commercialism increased significantly with grade level. For 63.7% of elementary school students, the most frequent type of commercialism was food coupons used as incentives. For secondary students, the type of commercialism most prevalent in schools was exclusive beverage contracts, which were in place in schools attended by 49.5% of middle school students and 69.8% of high school students. Exposure to elementary school coupons, as well as middle and high school exclusive beverage contracts, was significantly more likely for students attending schools with mid or low (vs high) student body socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most US elementary, middle, and high school students attend schools where they are exposed to commercial efforts aimed at obtaining food or beverage sales or developing brand recognition and loyalty for future sales. Although there have been significant decreases over time in many of the measures examined, the continuing high prevalence of school-based commercialism calls for, at minimum, clear and enforceable standards on the nutritional content of all foods and beverages marketed to youth in school settings.","Beverages/*statistics & numerical data Cross-Sectional Studies Food/*statistics & numerical data Food Dispensers, Automatic/*statistics & numerical data Food Services/*trends Humans Marketing/*trends Public Sector Schools/*trends United States/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies of maternal BMI and risk of fetal death, stillbirth, and infant death. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed and Embase databases were searched from inception to January 23, 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies reporting adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates for fetal death, stillbirth, or infant death by at least 3 categories of maternal BMI were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 1 reviewer and checked by the remaining reviewers for accuracy. Summary RRs were estimated using a random-effects model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Fetal death, stillbirth, and neonatal, perinatal, and infant death. RESULTS: Thirty eight studies (44 publications) with more than 10,147 fetal deaths, more than 16,274 stillbirths, more than 4311 perinatal deaths, 11,294 neonatal deaths, and 4983 infant deaths were included. The summary RR per 5-unit increase in maternal BMI for fetal death was 1.21 (95% CI, 1.09-1.35; I2 = 77.6%; n = 7 studies); for stillbirth, 1.24 (95% CI, 1.18-1.30; I2 = 80%; n = 18 studies); for perinatal death, 1.16 (95% CI, 1.00-1.35; I2 = 93.7%; n = 11 studies); for neonatal death, 1.15 (95% CI, 1.07-1.23; I2 = 78.5%; n = 12 studies); and for infant death, 1.18 (95% CI, 1.09-1.28; I2 = 79%; n = 4 studies). The test for nonlinearity was significant in all analyses but was most pronounced for fetal death. For women with a BMI of 20 (reference standard for all outcomes), 25, and 30, absolute risks per 10,000 pregnancies for fetal death were 76, 82 (95% CI, 76-88), and 102 (95% CI, 93-112); for stillbirth, 40, 48 (95% CI, 46-51), and 59 (95% CI, 55-63); for perinatal death, 66, 73 (95% CI, 67-81), and 86 (95% CI, 76-98); for neonatal death, 20, 21 (95% CI, 19-23), and 24 (95% CI, 22-27); and for infant death, 33, 37 (95% CI, 34-39), and 43 (95% CI, 40-47), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Even modest increases in maternal BMI were associated with increased risk of fetal death, stillbirth, and neonatal, perinatal, and infant death. Weight management guidelines for women who plan pregnancies should take these findings into consideration to reduce the burden of fetal death, stillbirth, and infant death.","Body Mass Index Female Fetal Death/*epidemiology Humans Infant, Newborn Obesity/*complications Pregnancy *Pregnancy Complications Risk Stillbirth/*epidemiology"

DESIGN Randomized controlled trial. SETTING Volunteer low-income families in public housing in 5 US cities between 1994-1997. PARTICIPANTS We analyze 4- to 7-year outcomes in youth aged 12 to 19 years (n = 2829, 89% effective response rate) in the Moving to Opportunity Study. INTERVENTION Families were randomized to remain in public housing (control group) or to receive government-funded rental subsidies to move into private apartments (experimental group). Intention-to-treat analyses included intervention interactions by gender and health vulnerability (defined as prerandomization health/developmental limitations or disabilities in family members). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Past-year psychological distress (Kessler 6 scale [K6]) and the Behavioral Problems Index (BPI). Supplemental analyses used past-year major depressive disorder (MDD). RESULTS Male gender (P = .02) and family health vulnerability (P = .002) significantly adversely modified the intervention effect on K6 scores; male gender (P = .01), but not health vulnerability (P = .17), significantly adversely modified the intervention effect on the BPI. Girls without baseline health vulnerabilities were the only subgroup to benefit on any outcome (K6: beta = -0.21; 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.07; P = .003; MDD: odds ratio = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.85; P = .02). For boys with health vulnerabilities, intervention was associated with worse K6 (beta = 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.44; P = .003) and BPI (beta = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.40; P = .002) values. Neither girls with health vulnerability nor boys without health vulnerability experienced intervention benefits. Adherence-adjusted instrumental variable analysis found intervention effects twice as large. Patterns were similar for MDD, but estimates were imprecise owing to low prevalence. CONCLUSIONS Although some girls benefited, boys and adolescents from families with baseline health problems did not experience mental health benefits from housing mobility policies and may need additional program supports.",Missing
24595778,Associations of housing mobility interventions for children in high-poverty neighborhoods with subsequent mental disorders during adolescence.,JAMA,Kessler RC and Duncan GJ and Gennetian LA and Katz LF and Kling JR and Sampson NA and Sanbonmatsu L and Zaslavsky AM and Ludwig J,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Youth in high-poverty neighborhoods have high rates of emotional problems. Understanding neighborhood influences on mental health is crucial for designing neighborhood-level interventions. OBJECTIVE: To perform an exploratory analysis of associations between housing mobility interventions for children in high-poverty neighborhoods and subsequent mental disorders during adolescence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Moving to Opportunity Demonstration from 1994 to 1998 randomized 4604 volunteer public housing families with 3689 children in high-poverty neighborhoods into 1 of 2 housing mobility intervention groups (a low-poverty voucher group vs a traditional voucher group) or a control group. The low-poverty voucher group (n=1430) received vouchers to move to low-poverty neighborhoods with enhanced mobility counseling. The traditional voucher group (n=1081) received geographically unrestricted vouchers. Controls (n=1178) received no intervention. Follow-up evaluation was performed 10 to 15 years later (June 2008-April 2010) with participants aged 13 to 19 years (0-8 years at randomization). Response rates were 86.9% to 92.9%. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Presence of mental disorders from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) within the past 12 months, including major depressive disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), oppositional-defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and conduct disorder, as assessed post hoc with a validated diagnostic interview. RESULTS: Of the 3689 adolescents randomized, 2872 were interviewed (1407 boys and 1465 girls). Compared with the control group, boys in the low-poverty voucher group had significantly increased rates of major depression (7.1% vs 3.5%; odds ratio (OR), 2.2 [95% CI, 1.2-3.9]), PTSD (6.2% vs 1.9%; OR, 3.4 [95% CI, 1.6-7.4]), and conduct disorder (6.4% vs 2.1%; OR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.7-5.8]). Boys in the traditional voucher group had increased rates of PTSD compared with the control group (4.9% vs 1.9%, OR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.2-5.8]). However, compared with the control group, girls in the traditional voucher group had decreased rates of major depression (6.5% vs 10.9%; OR, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.3-0.9]) and conduct disorder (0.3% vs 2.9%; OR, 0.1 [95% CI, 0.0-0.4]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Interventions to encourage moving out of high-poverty neighborhoods were associated with increased rates of depression, PTSD, and conduct disorder among boys and reduced rates of depression and conduct disorder among girls. Better understanding of interactions among individual, family, and neighborhood risk factors is needed to guide future public housing policy changes.","Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Counseling Female Financing, Personal Follow-Up Studies Humans Intervention Studies Male Mental Disorders/*epidemiology *Poverty *Public Housing Public Policy *Residence Characteristics Risk Sex Factors Young Adult"
23780459,Magnetic resonance imaging screening to identify spinal and paraspinal infections associated with injections of contaminated methylprednisolone acetate.,JAMA,Malani AN and Vandenberg DM and Singal B and Kasotakis M and Koch S and Moudgal V and Jagarlamudi R and Neelakanta A and Otto MH and Halasyamani L and Kaakaji R and Kauffman CA,trinity-health,"IMPORTANCE: Injection of contaminated methylprednisolone has resulted in an unprecedented nationwide outbreak of Exserohilum rostratum fungal infections, manifested initially as meningitis and/or basilar stroke. Insidious onset of spinal or paraspinal infection at the injection site has been increasingly reported and is occurring months after receipt of injection with the contaminated drug. The clinical findings are often subtle and similar to those that led the patient to undergo the methylprednisolone injection. OBJECTIVE: To determine if patients who had not presented for medical care but who had received contaminated methylprednisolone developed spinal or paraspinal infection at the injection site using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: There were 172 patients who had received an injection of contaminated methylprednisolone from a highly contaminated lot (No. 06292012@26) at a pain facility but had not presented for medical care related to adverse effects after the injection. Screening MRI was performed between November 9, 2012, and April 30, 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number of persons identified with previously undiagnosed spinal or paraspinal infection. RESULTS: Of the 172 patients screened, MRI was abnormal in 36 (21%), showing epidural or paraspinal abscess or phlegmon, arachnoiditis, spinal osteomyelitis or diskitis, or moderate to severe epidural, paraspinal, or intradural enhancement. Of the 115 patients asked about new or worsening back or neck pain, lower extremity weakness, or radiculopathy symptoms, 35 (30%) had at least 1 symptom. Thirty-five of the 36 patients with abnormal MRIs met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition for probable (17 patients) or confirmed (18 patients) fungal spinal or paraspinal infection. All 35 patients were treated with antifungal agents (voriconazole, with or without liposomal amphotericin B), and 24 required surgical debridement. At the time of surgery, 17 of 24 patients (71%), including 5 patients who denied having symptoms, had laboratory evidence of fungal infection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients who underwent screening MRI to look for infection at the site of injection of contaminated methylprednisolone, 21% had an abnormal MRI, and all but one met CDC criteria for probable or confirmed fungal spinal or paraspinal infection. Screening MRI led to identification of patients who had minimal or no symptoms of spinal or paraspinal infection and allowed early initiation of medical and surgical treatment.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Back Pain/drug therapy Disease Outbreaks *Drug Contamination Female Follow-Up Studies Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Humans *Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Mass Screening Meningitis/epidemiology/etiology Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Middle Aged Risk Factors Soft Tissue Infections/*diagnosis/etiology Spinal Diseases/*diagnosis/etiology Young Adult"
25222633,Hospital Costs of Multiple-Birth and Singleton-Birth Children During the First 5 Years of Life and the Role of Assisted Reproductive Technology.,JAMA Pediatr,Chambers GM and Hoang VP and Lee E and Hansen M and Sullivan EA and Bower C and Chapman M,Missing,"Importance: The unprecedented increase in multiple births during the past 3 decades is a major public health concern and parallels the uptake of medically assisted conception. The economic implications of such births are not well understood. Objectives: To conduct a comprehensive economic and health services assessment of the frequency, duration, and cost of hospital admissions during the first 5 years of life for singleton, twin, and higher-order multiple (HOM) children and to examine the contribution of assisted reproductive technology (ART) to the incidence and cost of multiple births. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective population cohort study using individually linked birth, hospital, and death records among 233 850 infants born in Western Australia between October 1993 and September 2003, and followed up to September 2008. Exposures: Multiple-gestation delivery and ART conception. Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds of stillbirth, prematurity and low birth weight, frequency and length of hospital admissions, the mean costs by plurality, and the independent effect of prematurity on childhood costs. Results: Of 226 624 singleton, 6941 twin, and 285 HOM infants, 1.0% of singletons, 15.4% of twins, and 34.7% of HOM children were conceived following ART. Compared with singletons, twins and HOMs were 3.4 and 9.6 times, respectively, more likely to be stillborn and were 6.4 and 36.7 times, respectively, more likely to die during the neonatal period. Twins and HOMs were 18.7 and 525.1 times, respectively, more likely to be preterm, and 3.6 and 2.8 times, respectively, more likely to be small for gestational age. The mean hospital costs of a singleton, twin, and HOM child to age 5 years were $2730, $8993, and $24 411 (in 2009-2010 US dollars), respectively, with cost differences concentrated in the neonatal period and during the first year of life. Almost 15% of inpatient costs for multiple births could have been avoided if ART twins and HOMs had been born as singletons. Conclusions and Relevance: Compared with singletons, multiple-birth infants consume significantly more hospital resources, particularly during the neonatal period and first year of life. A significant proportion of the clinical and economic burden associated with multiple births can be prevented through single-embryo transfer. Increasing ART use worldwide and persistently high ART multiple-birth rates in several countries highlight the need for strategies that encourage single-embryo transfer. The costs from this study can be generalized to other settings.",Missing
24126948,Multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroids for preterm birth study: outcomes in children at 5 years of age (MACS-5).,JAMA Pediatr,Asztalos EV and Murphy KE and Willan AR and Matthews SG and Ohlsson A and Saigal S and Armson BA and Kelly EN and Delisle MF and Gafni A and Lee SK and Sananes R and Rovet J and Guselle P and Amankwah K and Saleem M and Sanchez J,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: A single course of antenatal corticosteroid therapy is recommended for pregnant women at risk of preterm birth between 24 and 33 weeks' gestational age. However, 50% of women remain pregnant 7 to 14 days later, leading to the question of whether additional courses should be given to women remaining at risk for preterm birth. The Multiple Courses of Antenatal Corticosteroids for Preterm Birth Study (MACS) was an international randomized clinical trial that compared multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroids with a single course in women at risk of preterm birth. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of single vs multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroid therapy on death or neurodevelopmental disability (neuromotor, neurosensory, or neurocognitive/neurobehavioral function) at 5 years of age in children whose mothers participated in MACS. Our secondary aims were to determine the effect on height, weight, head circumference, blood pressure, intelligence, and specific cognitive (visual, spatial, and language) skills. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort follow-up study of children seen between June 2006 and May 2012 at 55 centers. In total, 1724 women (2141 children) were eligible for the study, of whom 1728 children (80.7% of the 2141 eligible children) participated and 1719 children contributed to the primary outcome. INTERVENTION: Single and multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroid therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was death or survival with a neurodevelopmental disability in 1 of the following domains: neuromotor (nonambulatory cerebral palsy), neurosensory (blindness, deafness, or need for visual/hearing aids), or neurocognitive/neurobehavioral function (abnormal attention, memory, or behavior). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups in the risk of death or neurodevelopmental disability: 217 of 871 children (24.9%) in the multiple-courses group vs 210 of 848 children (24.8%) in the single-course group (odds ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.81 to 1.29]; P = .84). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Multiple courses, compared with a single course, of antenatal corticosteroid therapy did not increase or decrease the risk of death or disability at 5 years of age. Because of a lack of strong conclusive evidence of short-term or long-term benefits, it remains our opinion that multiple courses not be recommended in women with ongoing risk of preterm birth.

Observational studies have not provided evidence regarding associations of multivitamin use with total and site-specific cancer incidence or mortality. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether long-term multivitamin supplementation decreases the risk of total and site-specific cancer events among men. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial (Physicians"" Health Study II) of 14 641 male US physicians initially aged 50 years or older (mean [SD] age, 64.3 [9.2] years), including 1312 men with a history of cancer at randomization, enrolled in a common multivitamin study that began in 1997 with treatment and follow-up through June 1, 2011. INTERVENTION: Daily multivitamin or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), with prostate, colorectal, and other site-specific cancers among the secondary end points. RESULTS: During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 11.2 (10.7-13.3) years, there were 2669 men with confirmed cancer, including 1373 cases of prostate cancer and 210 cases of colorectal cancer. Compared with placebo, men taking a daily multivitamin had a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of total cancer (multivitamin and placebo groups, 17.0 and 18.3 events, respectively, per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.998; P=.04). There was no significant effect of a daily multivitamin on prostate cancer (multivitamin and placebo groups, 9.1 and 9.2 events, respectively, per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88-1.09; P=.76), colorectal cancer (multivitamin and placebo groups, 1.2 and 1.4 events, respectively, per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.68-1.17; P=.39), or other site-specific cancers. There was no significant difference in the risk of cancer mortality (multivitamin and placebo groups, 4.9 and 5.6 events, respectively, per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77-1.01; P=.07). Daily multivitamin use was associated with a reduction in total cancer among 1312 men with a baseline history of cancer (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.96; P=.02), but this did not differ significantly from that among 13 329 men initially without cancer (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87-1.02; P=.15; P for interaction=.07). Conclusion In this large prevention trial of male physicians, daily multivitamin supplementation modestly but significantly reduced the risk of total cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether statin use is associated with musculoskeletal conditions, including arthropathy and injury, in a military health care system. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study with propensity score matching. SETTING: San Antonio Military Multi-Market. PARTICIPANTS: Tricare Prime/Plus beneficiaries evaluated from October 1, 2003, to March 1, 2010. INTERVENTIONS: Statin use during fiscal year 2005. On the basis of medication fills, patients were divided into 2 groups: statin users (received a statin for at least 90 days) and nonusers (never received a statin throughout the study period). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Using patients' baseline characteristics, we generated a propensity score that was used to match statin users and nonusers; odds ratios (ORs) were determined for each outcome measure. Secondary analyses determined adjusted ORs for all patients who met study criteria and a subgroup of patients with no comorbidities identified using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Sensitivity analysis further determined adjusted ORs for a subgroup of patients with no musculoskeletal diseases at baseline and a subgroup of patients who continued statin therapy for 2 years or more. The occurrence of musculoskeletal conditions was determined using prespecified groups of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, ClinicalModification codes: Msk1, all musculoskeletal diseases; Msk1a, arthropathies and related diseases; Msk1b, injury-related diseases (dislocation, sprain, strain); and Msk2, drug-associated musculoskeletal pain. RESULTS: A total of 46 249 individuals met study criteria (13 626 statin users and 32 623 nonusers). Of these, we propensity score-matched 6967 statin users with 6967 nonusers. Among matched pairs, statin users had a higher OR for Msk1 (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08-1.30), Msk1b (1.13; 1.05-1.21), and Msk2 (1.09; 1.02-1.18); the OR for Msk1a was 1.07 (0.99-1.16; P = .07). Secondary and sensitivity analyses revealed higher adjusted ORs for statin users in all outcome groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Musculoskeletal conditions, arthropathies, injuries, and pain are more common among statin users than among similar nonusers. The full spectrum of statins' musculoskeletal adverse events may not be fully explored, and further studies are warranted, especially in physically active individuals.","Cohort Studies Dislocations/epidemiology Female Humans Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*adverse effects Joint Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology Logistic Models Male Matched-Pair Analysis Middle Aged Muscle, Skeletal/*injuries Musculoskeletal Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology Pain/chemically induced/epidemiology Propensity Score Retrospective Studies Sprains and Strains/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVE: To test whether listening to self-initiated patient-directed music (PDM) can reduce anxiety and sedative exposure during ventilatory support in critically ill patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized clinical trial that enrolled 373 patients from 12 intensive care units (ICUs) at 5 hospitals in the Minneapolis-St Paul, Minnesota, area receiving acute mechanical ventilatory support for respiratory failure between September 2006 and March 2011. Of the patients included in the study, 86% were white, 52% were female, and the mean (SD) age was 59 (14) years. The patients had a mean (SD) Acute Physiology, Age and Chronic Health Evaluation III score of 63 (21.6) and a mean (SD) of 5.7 (6.4) study days. INTERVENTIONS: Self-initiated PDM (n = 126) with preferred selections tailored by a music therapist whenever desired while receiving ventilatory support, self-initiated use of noise-canceling headphones (NCH; n = 122), or usual care (n = 125). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Daily assessments of anxiety (on 100-mm visual analog scale) and 2 aggregate measures of sedative exposure (intensity and frequency). RESULTS: Patients in the PDM group listened to music for a mean (SD) of 79.8 (126) (median [range], 12 [0-796]) minutes/day. Patients in the NCH group wore the noise-abating headphones for a mean (SD) of 34.0 (89.6) (median [range], 0 [0-916]) minutes/day. The mixed-models analysis showed that at any time point, patients in the PDM group had an anxiety score that was 19.5 points lower (95% CI, -32.2 to -6.8) than patients in the usual care group (P = .003). By the fifth study day, anxiety was reduced by 36.5% in PDM patients. The treatment x time interaction showed that PDM significantly reduced both measures of sedative exposure. Compared with usual care, the PDM group had reduced sedation intensity by -0.18 (95% CI, -0.36 to -0.004) points/day (P = .05) and had reduced frequency by -0.21 (95% CI, -0.37 to -0.05) points/day (P = .01). The PDM group had reduced sedation frequency by -0.18 (95% CI, -0.36 to -0.004) points/day vs the NCH group (P = .04). By the fifth study day, the PDM patients received 2 fewer sedative doses (reduction of 38%) and had a reduction of 36% in sedation intensity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among ICU patients receiving acute ventilatory support for respiratory failure, PDM resulted in greater reduction in anxiety compared with usual care, but not compared with NCH. Concurrently, PDM resulted in greater reduction in sedation frequency compared with usual care or NCH, and greater reduction in sedation intensity compared with usual care, but not compared with NCH.

OBJECTIVE: To report the use of natalizumab in pediatric MS. Natalizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting alpha4 integrin, is effective against active relapsing-remitting MS in adults. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Eleven centers for neurology and pediatric neurology in Germany and Austria. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 20 pediatric patients with MS who started treatment with natalizumab prior to 18 years of age. These patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging as clinically indicated, despite the fact that 19 of these 20 patients were undergoing first-line disease-modifying therapy. The mean (SD) age at initiation of natalizumab therapy was 16.7 (1.1) years, and the mean (SD) pretreatment period was 18 (10) months. INTERVENTION: Natalizumab, 300 mg every 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Annualized relapse rates, Expanded Disability Status Scale scores, number of new T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery lesions and contrast-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, number of adverse events, the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against natalizumab, and serum JC virus-antibody status. RESULTS Treatment with natalizumab was associated with reductions in mean annualized relapse rates (3.7 without treatment vs 0.4 with treatment; P < .001), median Expanded Disability Status Scale scores (2 without treatment vs 1 with treatment; P < .02), and mean number of new T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery lesions per year (7.8 without treatment vs 0.5 with treatment; P < .001). Two patients developed high-titer neutralizing antibodies against natalizumab and had to stop therapy. Adverse events included headaches, asthenia, infections, and hypersensitivity. Abnormal laboratory results were found for 8 patients. JC virus antibodies were found in 5 of 13 patients. After the discontinuation of natalizumab therapy, relapse activity occurred in 6 of 8 patients within 6 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our data indicate that natalizumab may be safe and effective against MS in pediatric patients with breakthrough disease.","Adolescent Anemia/chemically induced Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use Austria Disability Evaluation Female Follow-Up Studies Germany Humans Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use Integrin alpha4/immunology Interferon-beta/therapeutic use Leukocyte Count Liver/drug effects/enzymology Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use Multiple Sclerosis/blood/*drug therapy/*immunology Recurrence/prevention & control Retrospective Studies"

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether mononuclear cells in circulation from MS patients treated with natalizumab harbor JCV DNA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this prospective investigation, we enrolled 49 MS patients from the Clinical Center for Multiple Sclerosis at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and 18 healthy volunteers. We drew 120-mL blood samples from 26 MS patients at baseline and at approximately 3-month intervals to 10 months during the course of natalizumab infusions. One blood sample was drawn from 23 MS patients receiving natalizumab for more than 24 months and from 18 healthy volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: Natalizumab treatment of MS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The blood samples were separated using flow cytometry into CD34+, CD19+, and CD3+ cell subsets; DNA templates were prepared using quantitative polymerase chain reaction for JCV DNA identification. Plasma samples were tested for anti-JCV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays performed at the Laboratory of Molecular Medicine and Neuroscience, National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke. RESULTS: Thirteen of the 26 patients (50%) with baseline and follow-up blood samples had detectable viral DNA in at least 1 cell compartment at 1 or more points. Ten of the 23 patients (44%) receiving treatment for more than 24 months and 3 of the 18 healthy volunteers (17%) also had detectable viral DNA in 1 or more cell compartment. Fifteen of the 49 MS patients (31%) were confirmed to harbor JCV in CD34+ cells and 12 of 49 (24%) in CD19+ cells. Only 1 of 18 healthy volunteers were viremic in CD34+ cells and none in CD19+ cells. Nine patients and 1 healthy volunteer were viremic but had seronegative test results for JCV antibodies. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: JC virus DNA was detectable within cell compartments of natalizumab-treated MS patients after treatment inception and longer. JC virus DNA may harbor in CD34+ cells in bone marrow that mobilize into the peripheral circulation at high concentrations. Latently infected cells initiate differentiation to CD19+ cells that favors growth of JCV. These data link the mechanism of natalizumab treatment with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.","Animals Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use Antigens, CD19/*blood/genetics Antigens, CD34/*blood/genetics Aotidae Cell Line, Tumor DNA, Viral/blood Flow Cytometry/methods Follow-Up Studies Humans JC Virus/*metabolism Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy/genetics/virology Prospective Studies"
24100409,Prevalence rates of male and female sexual violence perpetrators in a national sample of adolescents.,JAMA Pediatr,Ybarra ML and Mitchell KJ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE Sexual violence can emerge in adolescence, yet little is known about youth perpetrators-especially those not involved with the criminal justice system. OBJECTIVE To report national estimates of adolescent sexual violence perpetration and details of the perpetrator experience. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data were collected online in 2010 (wave 4) and 2011 (wave 5) in the national Growing Up With Media study. Participants included 1058 youths aged 14 to 21 years who at baseline read English, lived in the household at least 50% of the time, and had used the Internet in the last 6 months. Recruitment was balanced on youths' biological sex and age. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Forced sexual contact, coercive sex, attempted rape, and completed rape. RESULTS Nearly 1 in 10 youths (9%) reported some type of sexual violence perpetration in their lifetime; 4% (10 females and 39 males) reported attempted or completed rape. Sixteen years old was the mode age of first sexual perpetration (n = 18 [40%]). Perpetrators reported greater exposure to violent X-rated content. Almost all perpetrators (98%) who reported age at first perpetration to be 15 years or younger were male, with similar but attenuated results among those who began at ages 16 or 17 years (90%). It is not until ages 18 or 19 years that males (52%) and females (48%) are relatively equally represented as perpetrators. Perhaps related to age at first perpetration, females were more likely to perpetrate against older victims, and males were more likely to perpetrate against younger victims. Youths who started perpetrating earlier were more likely than older youths to get in trouble with caregivers; youths starting older were more likely to indicate that no one found out about the perpetration. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Sexual violence perpetration appears to emerge earlier for males than females, perhaps suggesting different developmental trajectories. Links between perpetration and violent sexual media are apparent, suggesting a need to monitor adolescents' consumption of this material. Victim blaming appears to be common, whereas experiencing consequences does not. There is therefore urgent need for school programs that encourage bystander intervention as well as implementation of policies that could enhance the likelihood that perpetrators are identified.",Adolescent *Adolescent Behavior Adult Caregivers/*statistics & numerical data Female Humans Male Prevalence Risk Factors Sex Offenses/*statistics & numerical data Sexual Behavior/*statistics & numerical data Young Adult

Two disease-modifying therapies, hydroxyurea and long-term blood transfusions, are available but underused. OBJECTIVE: To support and expand the number of health professionals able and willing to provide care for persons with SCD. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Databases of MEDLINE (including in-process and other nonindexed citations), EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, TOXLINE, and Scopus were searched using prespecified search terms and keywords to identify randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized intervention studies, and observational studies. Literature searches of English-language publications from 1980 with updates through April 1, 2014, addressed key questions developed by the expert panel members and methodologists. FINDINGS: Strong recommendations for preventive services include daily oral prophylactic penicillin up to the age of 5 years, annual transcranial Doppler examinations from the ages of 2 to 16 years in those with sickle cell anemia, and long-term transfusion therapy to prevent stroke in those children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocity (>/=200 cm/s). Strong recommendations addressing acute complications include rapid initiation of opioids for treatment of severe pain associated with a vasoocclusive crisis, and use of incentive spirometry in patients hospitalized for a vasoocclusive crisis. Strong recommendations for chronic complications include use of analgesics and physical therapy for treatment of avascular necrosis, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for microalbuminuria in adults with SCD. Strong recommendations for children and adults with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy include referral to expert specialists for consideration of laser photocoagulation and for echocardiography to evaluate signs of pulmonary hypertension. Hydroxyurea therapy is strongly recommended for adults with 3 or more severe vasoocclusive crises during any 12-month period, with SCD pain or chronic anemia interfering with daily activities, or with severe or recurrent episodes of acute chest syndrome. A recommendation of moderate strength suggests offering treatment with hydroxyurea without regard to the presence of symptoms for infants, children, and adolescents. In persons with sickle cell anemia, preoperative transfusion therapy to increase hemoglobin levels to 10 g/dL is strongly recommended with a moderate strength recommendation to maintain sickle hemoglobin levels of less than 30% prior to the next transfusion during long-term transfusion therapy. A strong recommendation to assess iron overload is accompanied by a moderate strength recommendation to begin iron chelation therapy when indicated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hydroxyurea and transfusion therapy are strongly recommended for many individuals with SCD. Many other recommendations are based on quality of evidence that is less than high due to the paucity of clinical trials regarding screening, management, and monitoring for individuals with SCD.","Adolescent Adult Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use Anemia, Sickle Cell/*therapy Antibiotic Prophylaxis *Blood Transfusion Child Child, Preschool Consensus Development Conferences as Topic Evidence-Based Medicine Humans Hydroxyurea/*therapeutic use Infant Penicillins/therapeutic use Physical Therapy Modalities Practice Guidelines as Topic"

OBJECTIVE: To develop a novel composite measure for profiling hospital performance with bariatric surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using clinical registry data from the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative, we studied all patients undergoing bariatric surgery from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2010. For laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery, we used empirical Bayes techniques to create a composite measure by combining several measures, including serious complications, reoperations, and readmissions; hospital and surgeon volume; and outcomes with other related procedures. Hospitals were ranked for 2008 through 2009 and placed in 1 of 3 groups: 3-star (top 20%), 2-star (middle 60%), and 1-star (bottom 20%). We assessed how well these ratings predicted outcomes in the next year (2010) compared with other widely used measures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk-adjusted serious complications. RESULTS: Composite measures explained a larger proportion of hospital-level variation in serious complication rates with laparoscopic gastric bypass than other measures. For example, the composite measure explained 89% of the variation compared with only 28% for risk-adjusted complication rates alone. Composite measures also appeared better at predicting future performance compared with individual measures. When ranked on the composite measure, 1-star hospitals had 2-fold higher serious complication rates (4.6% vs 2.4%; odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5) compared with 3-star hospitals. Differences in serious complication rates between 1- and 3-star hospitals were much smaller when hospitals were ranked using serious complications (4.0% vs 2.7%; odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.8-2.9) and hospital volume (3.3% vs 3.2%; odds ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.4-1.7). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Composite measures are much better at explaining hospital-level variation in serious complications and predicting future performance than other approaches. In this preliminary study, it appears that such composite measures may be better than existing alternatives for profiling hospital performance with bariatric surgery.",Bariatric Surgery/*standards Female Gastric Bypass Hospitals/*classification/*standards Humans Laparoscopy Male Middle Aged Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology *Quality of Health Care Risk Assessment
23403680,Tedizolid phosphate vs linezolid for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections: the ESTABLISH-1 randomized trial.,JAMA,Prokocimer P and De Anda C and Fang E and Mehra P and Das A,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs), including cellulitis or erysipelas, major cutaneous abscesses, and wound infections, can be life-threatening and may require surgery and hospitalization. Increasingly, ABSSSIs are associated with drug-resistant pathogens, and many antimicrobial agents have adverse effects restricting their use. Tedizolid phosphate is a novel oxazolidinone in development for the treatment of ABSSSIs. OBJECTIVES: To establish the noninferiority of tedizolid phosphate vs linezolid in treating ABSSSIs and compare the safety of the 2 agents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The Efficacy and Safety of 6-day Oral Tedizolid in Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections vs 10-day Oral Linezolid Therapy (ESTABLISH-1) was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial that was conducted from August 2010 through September 2011 at 81 study centers in North America, Latin America, and Europe. The intent-to-treat analysis set consisted of data from 667 adults aged 18 years or older with ABSSSIs treated with tedizolid phosphate (n = 332) or linezolid (n = 335). INTERVENTIONS: A 200 mg once daily dose of oral tedizolid phosphate for 6 days or 600 mg of oral linezolid every 12 hours for 10 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcome was early clinical response at the 48- to 72-hour assessment (no increase in lesion surface area from baseline and oral temperature of </=37.6 degrees C, confirmed by a second temperature measurement within 24 hours). A 10% noninferiority margin was predefined. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat analysis set, the early clinical treatment response rates were 79.5% (95% CI, 74.8% to 83.7%) of 332 patients in the tedizolid phosphate group and 79.4% (95% CI, 74.7% to 83.6%) of 335 patients in the linezolid group (a treatment difference of 0.1% [95% CI, -6.1% to 6.2%]). The sustained clinical treatment response rates at the end of treatment (day 11) were 69.3% (95% CI, 64.0% to 74.2%) in the tedizolid phosphate group and 71.9% (95% CI, 66.8% to 76.7%) in the linezolid group (a treatment difference of -2.6% [95% CI, -9.6% to 4.2%]). Results of investigator-assessed clinical treatment success rates at a posttherapy evaluation visit (1-2 weeks after the end-of-treatment visit) were 85.5% (95% CI, 81.3% to 89.1%) in the tedizolid phosphate group and 86.0% (95% CI, 81.8% to 89.5%) in the linezolid group (a treatment difference of -0.5% [95% CI, -5.8% to 4.9%), and were similar for 178 patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from the primary lesion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Tedizolid phosphate was a statistically noninferior treatment to linezolid in early clinical response at 48 to 72 hours after initiating therapy for an ABSSSI. Tedizolid phosphate may be a reasonable alternative to linezolid for treating ABSSSI.

24934501,Breastfeeding in children of women taking antiepileptic drugs: cognitive outcomes at age 6 years.,JAMA Pediatr,Meador KJ and Baker GA and Browning N and Cohen MJ and Bromley RL and Clayton-Smith J and Kalayjian LA and Kanner A and Liporace JD and Pennell PB and Privitera M and Loring DW,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Breastfeeding is known to have beneficial effects, but concern exists that breastfeeding during maternal antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy may be harmful. We previously noted no adverse effects of breastfeeding associated with AED use on IQ at age 3 years, but IQ at age 6 years is more predictive of school performance and adult abilities. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of AED exposure via breastfeeding on cognitive functions at age 6 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective observational multicenter study of long-term neurodevelopmental effects of AED use. Pregnant women with epilepsy receiving monotherapy (ie, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, or valproate) were enrolled from October 14, 1999, through April 14, 2004, in the United States and the United Kingdom. At age 6 years, 181 children were assessed for whom we had both breastfeeding and IQ data. All mothers in this analysis continued taking the drug after delivery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Differential Ability Scales IQ was the primary outcome. Secondary measures included measures of verbal, nonverbal, memory, and executive functions. For our primary analysis, we used a linear regression model with IQ at age 6 years as the dependent variable, comparing children who breastfed with those who did not. Similar secondary analyses were performed for the other cognitive measures. RESULTS: In total, 42.9% of children were breastfed a mean of 7.2 months. Breastfeeding rates and duration did not differ across drug groups. The IQ at age 6 years was related to drug group (P < .001 [adjusted IQ worse by 7-13 IQ points for valproate compared to other drugs]), drug dosage (regression coefficient, -0.1; 95% CI, -0.2 to 0.0; P = .01 [higher dosage worse]), maternal IQ (regression coefficient, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.0 to 0.4; P = .01 [higher child IQ with higher maternal IQ]), periconception folate use (adjusted IQ 6 [95% CI, 2-10] points higher for folate, P = .005), and breastfeeding (adjusted IQ 4 [95% CI, 0-8] points higher for breastfeeding, P = .045). For the other cognitive domains, only verbal abilities differed between the breastfed and nonbreastfed groups (adjusted verbal index 4 [95% CI, 0-7] points higher for breastfed children, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: No adverse effects of AED exposure via breast milk were observed at age 6 years, consistent with another recent study at age 3 years. In our study, breastfed children exhibited higher IQ and enhanced verbal abilities. Additional studies are needed to fully delineate the effects of all AEDs.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether echocardiographic screening in the general population improves long-term survival or reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 6861 middle-aged participants from the population-based Tromso Study in Norway. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly allocated to an echocardiographic screening group (n = 3272) or a control group (n = 3589). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Using the as-treated approach, the data were analyzed for mortality and incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke. RESULTS: During 15 follow-up years, 880 persons (26.9%) in the screening group and 989 persons (27.6%) in the control group died (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.89-1.06). No significant differences between the groups were observed in the secondary outcome measures (sudden death, mortality from any heart disease, or incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke).

24886975,Body mass index and death by stroke: no obesity paradox.,JAMA Neurol,Dehlendorff C and Andersen KK and Olsen TS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Reports of an obesity paradox have led to uncertainty about secondary prevention in obese patients with stroke. The paradox is disputed and has been claimed to be an artifact due to selection bias. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the obesity paradox in stroke is real or an artificial finding due to selection bias. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied survival after stroke in relation to body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). To overcome selection bias, we studied only deaths caused by the index stroke on the assumption that death by stroke reported on a death certificate was due to the index stroke if death occurred within the first month poststroke. We used the Danish Stroke Register, containing information on all hospital admissions for stroke in Denmark from 2003 to 2012, and the Danish Registry of Causes of Death. The study included all registered Danes (n = 71 617) for whom information was available on BMI (n = 53 812), age, sex, civil status, stroke severity, stroke subtype, a predefined cardiovascular profile, and socioeconomic status. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The independent relation between BMI and death by the index stroke within the first week or month by calculating hazard ratios in multivariate Cox regression analysis and multiple imputation for cases for whom information on BMI was missing. RESULTS: Of the 71 617 patients, 7878 (11%) had died within the first month; of these, stroke was the cause of death of 5512 (70%). Of the patients for whom information on BMI was available, 9.7% were underweight, 39.0% were of normal weight, 34.5% were overweight, and 16.8% were obese. Body mass index was inversely related to mean age at stroke onset (P < .001). There was no difference in the risk for death by stroke in the first month among patients who were normal weight (reference), overweight (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.88-1.04), and obese (hazard ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.88-1.13). Analysis of deaths within 1 week gave similar results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We found no evidence of an obesity paradox in patients with stroke. Stroke occurred at a significantly younger age in patients with higher BMI. Hence, obese patients with stroke should continue to aim for normal weight.",Missing
23443442,Bariatric surgery complications before vs after implementation of a national policy restricting coverage to centers of excellence.,JAMA,Dimick JB and Nicholas LH and Ryan AM and Thumma JR and Birkmeyer JD,umich,"IMPORTANCE: Starting in 2006, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has restricted coverage of bariatric surgery to hospitals designated as centers of excellence (COE) by 2 major professional organizations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the implementation of the COE component of the national coverage decision was associated with improved bariatric surgery outcomes in Medicare patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective, longitudinal study using 2004-2009 hospital discharge data from 12 states (n = 321,464 patients) of changes in outcomes in Medicare patients undergoing bariatric surgery (n = 6723 before and n = 15,854 after implementation of the policy). A difference-in-differences analytic approach was used to evaluate whether the national coverage decision was associated with improved outcomes in Medicare patients above and beyond existing time trends in non-Medicare patients (n = 95,558 before and n = 155,117 after implementation of the policy). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk-adjusted rates of any complication, serious complications, and reoperation. RESULTS: Bariatric surgery outcomes improved during the study period in both Medicare and non-Medicare patients; however, this change was already under way prior to the CMS coverage decision. After accounting for patient factors, changes in procedure type, and preexisting time trends toward improved outcomes, there were no statistically significant improvements in outcomes after (vs before) implementation of the CMS national coverage decision for any complication (8.0% after vs 7.0% before; relative risk [RR], 1.14 [95% CI, 0.95-1.33]), serious complications (3.3% vs 3.6%, respectively; RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.62-1.22]), and reoperation (1.0% vs 1.1%; RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.64-1.17]). In a direct assessment comparing outcomes at hospitals designated as COEs (n = 179) vs hospitals without the COE designation (n = 519), no significant differences were found for any complication (5.5% vs 6.0%, respectively; RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.90-1.06]), serious complications (2.2% vs 2.5%; RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.84-1.00]), and reoperation (0.83% vs 0.96%; RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.86-1.17]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among Medicare patients undergoing bariatric surgery, there was no significant difference in the rates of complications and reoperation before vs after the CMS policy of restricting coverage to COEs.

The evaluation of hospital performance as measured by RSMRs and RSRRs has not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between hospital RSMRs and RSRRs overall and within subgroups defined by hospital characteristics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries discharged with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, or pneumonia between July 1, 2005, and June 30, 2008 (4506 hospitals for acute myocardial infarction, 4767 hospitals for heart failure, and 4811 hospitals for pneumonia). We quantified the correlation between hospital RSMRs and RSRRs using weighted linear correlation; evaluated correlations in groups defined by hospital characteristics; and determined the proportion of hospitals with better and worse performance on both measures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital 30-day RSMRs and RSRRs. RESULTS: Mean RSMRs and RSRRs, respectively, were 16.60% and 19.94% for acute myocardial infarction, 11.17% and 24.56% for heart failure, and 11.64% and 18.22% for pneumonia. The correlations between RSMRs and RSRRs were 0.03 (95% CI, -0.002 to 0.06) for acute myocardial infarction, -0.17 (95% CI, -0.20 to -0.14) for heart failure, and 0.002 (95% CI, -0.03 to 0.03) for pneumonia. The results were similar for subgroups defined by hospital characteristics. Although there was a significant negative linear relationship between RSMRs and RSRRs for heart failure, the shared variance between them was only 2.9% (r2 = 0.029), with the correlation most prominent for hospitals with RSMR <11%.

It is not known whether this extends to younger women. OBJECTIVE: To test whether prescribing CEE-based hormone therapy to postmenopausal women aged 50 to 55 years has longer-term effects on cognitive function. DESIGN: Trained, masked staff assessed participants with an annual telephone-administered cognitive battery that included measures of global and domain-specific cognitive functions. Cognitive testing was conducted an average of 7.2 years after the trials ended, when women had a mean age of 67.2 years, and repeated 1 year later. Enrollment occurred from 1996 through 1999. SETTING: Forty academic research centers. PARTICIPANTS: The study population comprised 1326 postmenopausal women, who had begun treatment in 2 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hormone therapy when aged 50 to 55 years. INTERVENTION: The clinical trials in which the women had participated had compared 0.625 mg CEE with or without 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate over a mean of 7.0 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was global cognitive function. Secondary outcomes were verbal memory, attention, executive function, verbal fluency, and working memory. RESULTS: Global cognitive function scores from women who had been assigned to CEE-based therapies were similar to those from women assigned to placebo: mean (95% CI) intervention effect of 0.02 (-0.08 to 0.12) standard deviation units (P = .66). Similarly, no overall differences were found for any individual cognitive domain (all P > .15). Prespecified subgroup analyses found some evidence that CEE-based therapies may have adversely affected verbal fluency among women who had prior hysterectomy or prior use of hormone therapy: mean treatment effects of -0.17 (-0.33 to -0.02) and -0.25 (-0.42 to -0.08), respectively; however, this may be a chance finding. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: CEE-based therapies produced no overall sustained benefit or risk to cognitive function when administered to postmenopausal women aged 50 to 55 years. We are not able to address whether initiating hormone therapy during menopause and maintaining therapy until any symptoms are passed affects cognitive function, either in the short or longer term.

Extensive atrial tissue fibrosis identified by delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been associated with poor outcomes of AF catheter ablation. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the feasibility of atrial tissue fibrosis estimation by delayed enhancement MRI and its association with subsequent AF ablation outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study of patients diagnosed with paroxysmal and persistent AF (undergoing their first catheter ablation) conducted between August 2010 and August 2011 at 15 centers in the United States, Europe, and Australia. Delayed enhancement MRI images were obtained up to 30 days before ablation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Fibrosis quantification was performed at a core laboratory blinded to the participating center, ablation approach, and procedure outcome. Fibrosis blinded to the treating physicians was categorized as stage 1 (<10% of the atrial wall), 2 (>/=10%-<20%), 3 (>/=20%-<30%), and 4 (>/=30%). Patients were followed up for recurrent arrhythmia per current guidelines using electrocardiography or ambulatory monitor recording and results were analyzed at a core laboratory. Cumulative incidence of recurrence was estimated by stage at days 325 and 475 after a 90-day blanking period (standard time allowed for arrhythmias related to ablation-induced inflammation to subside) and the risk of recurrence was estimated (adjusting for 10 demographic and clinical covariates). RESULTS: Atrial tissue fibrosis estimation by delayed enhancement MRI was successfully quantified in 272 of 329 enrolled patients (57 patients [17%] were excluded due to poor MRI quality). There were 260 patients who were followed up after the blanking period (mean [SD] age of 59.1 [10.7] years, 31.5% female, 64.6% with paroxysmal AF). For recurrent arrhythmia, the unadjusted overall hazard ratio per 1% increase in left atrial fibrosis was 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03-1.08; P < .001). Estimated unadjusted cumulative incidence of recurrent arrhythmia by day 325 for stage 1 fibrosis was 15.3% (95% CI, 7.6%-29.6%); stage 2, 32.6% (95% CI, 24.3%-42.9%); stage 3, 45.9% (95% CI, 35.5%-57.5%); and stage 4, 51.1% (95% CI, 32.8%-72.2%) and by day 475 was 15.3% (95% CI, 7.6%-29.6%), 35.8% (95% CI, 26.2%-47.6%), 45.9% (95% CI, 35.6%-57.5%), and 69.4% (95% CI, 48.6%-87.7%), respectively. Similar results were obtained after covariate adjustment. The addition of fibrosis to a recurrence prediction model that includes traditional clinical covariates resulted in an improved predictive accuracy with the C statistic increasing from 0.65 to 0.69 (risk difference of 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.09). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with AF undergoing catheter ablation, atrial tissue fibrosis estimated by delayed enhancement MRI was independently associated with likelihood of recurrent arrhythmia. The clinical implications of this association warrant further investigation.",Aged Atrial Fibrillation/*pathology/*therapy Catheter Ablation Female Fibrosis Heart Atria/*pathology Humans Incidence Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies Recurrence Risk Treatment Outcome
23939634,Making every word count for nonresponsive patients.,JAMA Neurol,Naci L and Owen AM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Despite the apparent absence of external signs of consciousness, a significant small proportion of patients with disorders of consciousness can respond to commands by willfully modulating their brain activity, even respond to yes or no questions, by performing mental imagery tasks. However, little is known about the mental life of such responsive patients, for example, with regard to whether they can have coherent thoughts or selectively maintain attention to specific events in their environment. The ability to selectively pay attention would provide evidence of a patient's preserved cognition and a method for brain-based communication, thus far untested with functional magnetic resonance imaging in this patient group. OBJECTIVE: To test whether selective auditory attention can be used to detect conscious awareness and communicate with behaviorally nonresponsive patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case study performed in 3 patients with severe brain injury, 2 diagnosed as being in a minimally conscious state and 1 as being in a vegetative state. The patients constituted a convenience sample. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired as the patients were asked to selectively attend to auditory stimuli, thereby conveying their ability to follow commands and communicate. RESULTS: All patients demonstrated command following according to instructions. Two patients (1 in a minimally conscious state and 1 in a vegetative state) were also able to guide their attention to repeatedly communicate correct answers to binary (yes or no) questions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, we show for the first time with functional magnetic resonance imaging that behaviorally nonresponsive patients can use selective auditory attention to convey their ability to follow commands and communicate. One patient in a minimally conscious state was able to use attention to establish functional communication in the scanner, despite his inability to produce any communication responses in repeated bedside examinations. More important, 1 patient, who had been in a vegetative state for 12 years before the scanning and subsequent to it, was able to use attention to correctly communicate answers to several binary questions. The technique may be useful in establishing basic communication with patients who appear unresponsive to bedside examinations and cannot respond with existing neuroimaging methods.","Acoustic Stimulation Adult Brain/blood supply/*physiopathology Brain Injuries/*complications Communication *Consciousness Disorders/etiology/pathology/psychology Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Oxygen Semantics *Vocabulary"
23903435,Staging of regional lymph nodes in melanoma: a case for including nonsentinel lymph node positivity in the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system.,JAMA Surg,Leung AM and Morton DL and Ozao-Choy J and Hari DM and Shin-Sim M and Difronzo AL and Faries MB,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Survival varies widely in patients with stage III melanoma. The existence of clinical significance for positive nonsentinel lymph node (NSLN) status would warrant consideration for incorporation into the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system and better prediction of survival. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether disease limited to sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) represents different clinical significance than disease spread into NSLNs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The database of the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John's Health Center, Santa Monica, California, was queried for all patients with SLNs positive for cutaneous melanoma who subsequently underwent completion lymph node dissection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Disease-free survival, melanoma-specific survival (MSS), and overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 4223 patients underwent SLN biopsy from 1986 to 2012. Of these patients, 329 had a tumor-positive SLN. Of the 329, 250 patients (76.0%) had no additional positive nodes and 79 (24.0%) had a tumor-positive NSLN. Factors predictive of NSLN positivity included older age (P = .04), greater Breslow thickness (P < .001), and ulceration (P < .02). Median overall survival was 178 months for the SLN-only positive group and 42.2 months for the NSLN positive group (5-year overall survival, 72.3% and 46.4%, respectively). Median MSS was not reached for the SLN-only positive group and was 60 months for the NSLN positive group (5-year MSS, 77.8% and 49.5%, respectively). On multivariate analysis, NSLN positivity had a strong association with recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.75; 95% CI, 1.23-2.50; P = .002), shorter overall survival (HR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.48-3.40; P < .001), and shorter MSS (HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.46-3.07; P < .001). To further control for the effects of total positive lymph nodes, comparison was done for patients with only N2 disease (2-3 total positive lymph nodes); the results of this comparison confirmed the independent effect of NSLN status (MSS; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Nonsentinel lymph node positivity is one of the most significant prognostic factors in patients with stage III melanoma. Subclassification of melanoma by NSLN tumor status should be considered for the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system.",Age Factors California Female Humans Lymph Node Excision Lymphatic Metastasis/*pathology Male Melanoma/*pathology Middle Aged Neoplasm Staging Predictive Value of Tests Prospective Studies Risk Factors Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Skin Neoplasms/*pathology Survival Rate

Objectives: To discover the molecular basis of this rare disorder and to determine the effects of complete absence of apoE on neurocognitive and visual function and on lipoprotein metabolism. Design, Setting, and Participants: Whole-exome sequencing was performed on the patient's DNA. He underwent detailed neurological and visual function testing and lipoprotein analysis. Lipoprotein analysis was also performed in the Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, on blood samples from the proband's mother, wife, 2 daughters, and normolipidemic control participants. Main Outcome Measures: Whole-exome sequencing, lipoprotein analysis, and neurocognitive function. Results: The patient was homozygous for an ablative APOE frameshift mutation (c.291del, p.E97fs). No other mutations likely to contribute to the phenotype were discovered, with the possible exception of two, in ABCC2 (p.I670T) and LIPC (p.G137R). Despite complete absence of apoE, he had normal vision, exhibited normal cognitive, neurological, and retinal function, had normal findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and had normal cerebrospinal fluid levels of beta-amyloid and tau proteins. He had no significant symptoms of cardiovascular disease except a suggestion of myocardial ischemia on treadmill testing and mild atherosclerosis noted on carotid ultrasonography. He had exceptionally high cholesterol content (760 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259) and a high cholesterol to triglycerides ratio (1.52) in very low-density lipoproteins with elevated levels of small-diameter high-density lipoproteins, including high levels of prebeta-1 high-density lipoprotein. Intermediate-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, and very low-density lipoproteins contained elevated apoA-I and apoA-IV levels. The patient's apoC-III and apoC-IV levels were decreased in very low-density lipoproteins. Electron microscopy revealed large lamellar particles having electron-opaque cores attached to electron-lucent zones in intermediate-density and low-density lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein particle diameters were distributed bimodally. Conclusions and Relevance: Despite a profound effect on lipoprotein metabolism, detailed neurocognitive and retinal studies failed to demonstrate any defects. This suggests that functions of apoE in the brain and eye are not essential or that redundant mechanisms exist whereby its role can be fulfilled. Targeted knockdown of apoE in the central nervous system might be a therapeutic modality in neurodegenerative disorders.",Missing

OBJECTIVES: To assess whether all-cause hospitalization and mortality rates are increased during norovirus outbreak vs nonoutbreak periods in nursing homes, and to identify factors associated with increased risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of Medicare-certified nursing homes in Oregon, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania that reported at least 1 confirmed or suspected norovirus outbreak to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS), January 2009 to December 2010. Deaths and hospitalizations occurring among residents of these nursing homes were identified through the Medicare Minimum Data Set (MDS). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of all-cause hospitalization and mortality during outbreak compared with nonoutbreak periods were estimated using a random-effects Poisson regression model controlling for background seasonality in both outcomes. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 308 nursing homes that reported 407 norovirus outbreaks to NORS. Per MDS, 67 730 hospitalizations and 26 055 deaths occurred in these homes during the 2-year study. Hospitalization rates were 124.0 (95% CI, 119.4-129.1) vs 109.5 (95% CI, 108.6-110.3) hospitalizations per nursing home-year during outbreak vs nonoutbreak periods, yielding a seasonally adjusted rate ratio (RR) of 1.09 (95% CI, 1.05-1.14). Similarly, mortality rates were 53.7 (95% CI, 50.6-57.0) vs 41.9 (95% CI, 41.4-42.4) deaths per nursing home-year in outbreak vs nonoutbreak periods (seasonally adjusted RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.18). The increases in hospitalizations and mortality were concentrated in the first 2 weeks (week 0 and 1) and the initial week (week 0) of the outbreak, respectively. Homes with lower daily registered nurse (RN) hours per resident (<0.75) had increased mortality rates during norovirus outbreaks compared with baseline (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.14-1.40), while no increased risk (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.96-1.12) was observed in homes with higher daily RN hours per resident (P = .007 by likelihood ratio test); the increase in hospitalization rates did not show a similar pattern.

24217806,Obesity and late-age survival without major disease or disability in older women.,JAMA Intern Med,Rillamas-Sun E and LaCroix AZ and Waring ME and Kroenke CH and LaMonte MJ and Vitolins MZ and Seguin R and Bell CL and Gass M and Manini TM and Masaki KH and Wallace RB,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The effect of obesity on late-age survival in women without disease or disability is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether higher baseline body mass index and waist circumference affect women's survival to 85 years of age without major chronic disease (coronary disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes mellitus, or hip fracture) and mobility disability. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Examination of 36,611 women from the Women's Health Initiative observational study and clinical trial programs who could have reached 85 years or older if they survived to the last outcomes evaluation on September 17, 2012. Recruitment was from 40 US clinical centers from October 1993 through December 1998. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% CIs for the association of baseline body mass index and waist circumference with the outcomes, adjusting for demographic, behavioral, and health characteristics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mutually exclusive classifications: (1) survived without major chronic disease and without mobility disability (healthy); (2) survived with 1 or more major chronic disease at baseline but without new disease or disability (prevalent diseased); (3) survived and developed 1 or more major chronic disease but not disability during study follow-up (incident diseased); (4) survived and developed mobility disability with or without disease (disabled); and (5) did not survive (died). RESULTS: Mean (SD) baseline age was 72.4 (3.0) years (range, 66-81 years). The distribution of women classified as healthy, prevalent diseased, incident diseased, disabled, and died was 19.0%, 14.7%, 23.2%, 18.3%, and 24.8%, respectively. Compared with healthy-weight women, underweight and obese women were more likely to die before 85 years of age. Overweight and obese women had higher risks of incident disease and mobility disability. Disability risks were striking. Relative to healthy-weight women, adjusted odds ratios (95% CIs) of mobility disability were 1.6 (1.5-1.8) for overweight women and 3.2 (2.9-3.6), 6.6 (5.4-8.1), and 6.7 (4.8-9.2) for class I, II, and III obesity, respectively. Waist circumference greater than 88 cm was also associated with higher risk of earlier death, incident disease, and mobility disability. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Overall and abdominal obesity were important and potentially modifiable factors associated with dying or developing mobility disability and major chronic disease before 85 years of age in older women.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Body Mass Index Chronic Disease/*epidemiology Comorbidity Disease-Free Survival Female Humans Logistic Models *Mobility Limitation Obesity/*mortality Obesity, Abdominal/mortality Odds Ratio Risk Factors Thinness/mortality Waist Circumference"

OBJECTIVE: To provide the most recent national estimates of childhood obesity, analyze trends in childhood obesity between 2003 and 2012, and provide detailed obesity trend analyses among adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Weight and height or recumbent length were measured in 9120 participants in the 2011-2012 nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In infants and toddlers from birth to 2 years, high weight for recumbent length was defined as weight for length at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. In children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years, obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific CDC BMI-for-age growth charts. In adults, obesity was defined as a BMI greater than or equal to 30. Analyses of trends in high weight for recumbent length or obesity prevalence were conducted overall and separately by age across 5 periods (2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2012). RESULTS: In 2011-2012, 8.1% (95% CI, 5.8%-11.1%) of infants and toddlers had high weight for recumbent length, and 16.9% (95% CI, 14.9%-19.2%) of 2- to 19-year-olds and 34.9% (95% CI, 32.0%-37.9%) of adults (age-adjusted) aged 20 years or older were obese. Overall, there was no significant change from 2003-2004 through 2011-2012 in high weight for recumbent length among infants and toddlers, obesity in 2- to 19-year-olds, or obesity in adults. Tests for an interaction between survey period and age found an interaction in children (P = .03) and women (P = .02). There was a significant decrease in obesity among 2- to 5-year-old children (from 13.9% to 8.4%; P = .03) and a significant increase in obesity among women aged 60 years and older (from 31.5% to 38.1%; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Overall, there have been no significant changes in obesity prevalence in youth or adults between 2003-2004 and 2011-2012. Obesity prevalence remains high and thus it is important to continue surveillance.","Adolescent Adult Aged Body Mass Index Body Weight Child Child, Preschool Female Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Nutrition Surveys Obesity/*epidemiology Pediatric Obesity/*epidemiology Prevalence Sex Distribution United States/epidemiology"
24535222,Appetite and growth: a longitudinal sibling analysis.,JAMA Pediatr,van Jaarsveld CH and Boniface D and Llewellyn CH and Wardle J,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Identifying early markers of future obesity risk can help target preventive interventions. Several studies have shown that a heartier appetite in infancy is a risk factor for more rapid weight gain, but to date no investigations have been able to rule out familial confounding. OBJECTIVES: To use a sibling design (data from same-sex, dizygotic twin pairs) to test the hypothesis that sibling differences in infant appetite predicted differential weight gain during childhood. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Gemini is a population-based twin cohort among the general United Kingdom population born between March 1, 2007, and December 15, 2007. Growth trajectories were analyzed from birth to age 15 months. Appetite-discordant pairs were selected from 800 nonidentical, same-sex twin pairs. EXPOSURES: Appetite during the first 3 months of life was assessed with the food responsiveness (FR) and satiety responsiveness (SR) subscales from the Baby Eating Behaviour Questionnaire. Discordance was defined as a within-pair difference of at least 1 SD. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A mean of 11.5 weight measurements per child were available between birth and age 15 months. Multilevel models, adjusted for sex and birth weight, compared growth curves for the higher-appetite vs lower-appetite twins. RESULTS: In total, 172 pairs were discordant for SR and 121 pairs for FR. Within-pair analyses showed that those with higher FR and those with lower SR grew faster than their sibling. At age 6 months, those with higher FR were 654 (95% CI, 395-913) g heavier and at age 15 months were 991 (95% CI, 484-1498) g heavier. For sibling pairs discordant for SR, the weight differences between siblings were 637 (95% CI, 438-836) g at age 6 months and 918 (95% CI, 569-1267) g at age 15 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A heartier appetite (indexed with higher FR or lower SR) in early infancy is prospectively associated with more rapid growth up to age 15 months in a design controlling for potential familial confounding, supporting a causal role for appetite in childhood weight gain. Appetite could be an early marker for risk of weight gain in the current obesogenic environment and might be a potential target for preventive interventions.","Adult Appetite/*physiology Body Weight/*physiology Feeding Behavior/*physiology Female Great Britain Growth Charts Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Longitudinal Studies Male Pediatric Obesity/*physiopathology Questionnaires Risk Factors Siblings"

Exploring the degree to which these disorders share etiological factors might provide useful implications for clinicians, researchers, and those with the disorders. Objectives: To assess whether patients with OCD experience an enhanced risk of developing schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders and to determine whether a family history of OCD constitutes a risk factor for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants: Using individual data from longitudinal nationwide Danish registers, we conducted a prospective cohort study with 45 million person-years of follow-up. All survival analyses were adjusted for sex, age, calendar year, parental age, and place of residence at the time of birth. A total of 3 million people born between January 1, 1955, and November 30, 2006, were followed up from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2012. During this period, 30 556 people developed schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Main Outcomes and Measures: The presence of a prior diagnosis of OCD and the risk of a first lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia and a schizophrenia spectrum disorder assigned by a psychiatrist in a hospital, outpatient clinic, or emergency department setting. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and accompanying 95% confidence intervals are used as measures of relative risk. Results: The presence of prior diagnosis of OCD was associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia (IRR = 6.90; 95% CI, 6.25-7.60) and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (IRR = 5.77; 95% CI, 5.33-6.22) later in life. Similarly, offspring of parents diagnosed as having OCD had an increased risk of schizophrenia (IRR = 4.31; 95% CI, 2.72-6.43) and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (IRR = 3.10; 95% CI, 2.17-4.27). The results remained significant after adjusting for family history of psychiatric disorders and the patient's psychiatric history. Conclusions and Relevance: A diagnosis of OCD was associated with higher rates of schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The observed increase in risk suggests that OCD, schizophrenia, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders probably lay on a common etiological pathway.",Missing
25038356,Effect of optional home initiation of HIV care following HIV self-testing on antiretroviral therapy initiation among adults in Malawi: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,MacPherson P and Lalloo DG and Webb EL and Maheswaran H and Choko AT and Makombe SD and Butterworth AE and van Oosterhout JJ and Desmond N and Thindwa D and Squire SB and Hayes RJ and Corbett EL,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Self-testing for HIV infection may contribute to early diagnosis of HIV, but without necessarily increasing antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether offering optional home initiation of HIV care after HIV self-testing might increase demand for ART initiation, compared with HIV self-testing accompanied by facility-based services only. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized trial conducted in Blantyre, Malawi, between January 30 and November 5, 2012, using restricted 1:1 randomization of 14 community health worker catchment areas. Participants were all adult (>/=16 years) residents (n = 16,660) who received access to home HIV self-testing through resident volunteers. This was a second-stage randomization of clusters allocated to the HIV self-testing group of a parent trial. INTERVENTIONS: Clusters were randomly allocated to facility-based care or optional home initiation of HIV care (including 2 weeks of ART if eligible) for participants reporting positive HIV self-test results. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The preplanned primary outcome compared between groups the proportion of all adult residents who initiated ART within the first 6 months of HIV self-testing availability. Secondary outcomes were uptake of HIV self-testing, reporting of positive HIV self-test results, and rates of loss from ART at 6 months. RESULTS: A significantly greater proportion of adults in the home group initiated ART (181/8194, 2.2%) compared with the facility group (63/8466, 0.7%; risk ratio [RR], 2.94, 95% CI, 2.10-4.12; P < .001). Uptake of HIV self-testing was high in both the home (5287/8194, 64.9%) and facility groups (4433/8466, 52.7%; RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.96-1.58; P = .10). Significantly more adults reported positive HIV self-test results in the home group (490/8194 [6.0%] vs the facility group, 278/8466 [3.3%]; RR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.16-2.97; P = .006). After 6 months, 52 of 181 ART initiators (28.7%) and 15 of 63 ART initiators (23.8%) in the home and facility groups, respectively, were lost from ART (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.62-2.25, P = .57).

OBJECTIVE: To determine national estimates of disability during the last 2 years of life. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A nationally representative study of older adults in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Participants 50 years and older who died while enrolled in the Health and Retirement Study between 1995 and 2010. Each participant was interviewed once at a varying time point in the last 24 months of life. We used these interviews to calculate national estimates of the prevalence of disability across the 2 years prior to death. We modeled the prevalence of disability in the 2 years prior to death for groups defined by age at death and sex. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Disability was defined as need for help with at least 1 of the following activities of daily living: dressing, bathing, eating, transferring, walking across the room, and using the toilet. RESULTS: There were 8232 decedents (mean [SD] age at death, 79 [11] years; 52% women). The prevalence of disability increased from 28% (95% CI, 24%-31%) 2 years before death to 56% (95% CI, 52%-60%) in the last month of life. Those who died at the oldest ages were much more likely to have disability 2 years before death (ages 50-69 years, 14%; 70-79 years, 21%; 80-89 years, 32%; 90 years or more, 50%; P for trend, <.001). Disability was more common in women 2 years before death (32% [95% CI, 28%-36%]) than men (21% [95% CI, 18%-25%]; P < .001), even after adjustment for older age at death. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Those who live to an older age are likely to be disabled, and thus in need of caregiving assistance, many months or years prior to death.

The effects of advancing paternal age at childbearing on offspring morbidity remain unclear, however, because of inconsistent epidemiologic findings and the inability of previous studies to rigorously rule out confounding factors. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between advancing paternal age at childbearing and numerous indexes of offspring morbidity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a population-based cohort study of all individuals born in Sweden in 1973-2001 (N = 2,615,081), with subsets of the data used to predict childhood or adolescent morbidity. We estimated the risk of psychiatric and academic morbidity associated with advancing paternal age using several quasi-experimental designs, including the comparison of differentially exposed siblings, cousins, and first-born cousins. EXPOSURE: Paternal age at childbearing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Psychiatric (autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, psychosis, bipolar disorder, suicide attempt, and substance use problem) and academic (failing grades and low educational attainment) morbidity. RESULTS: In the study population, advancing paternal age was associated with increased risk of some psychiatric disorders (eg, autism, psychosis, and bipolar disorders) but decreased risk of the other indexes of morbidity. In contrast, the sibling-comparison analyses indicated that advancing paternal age had a dose-response relationship with every index of morbidity, with the magnitude of the associations being as large or larger than the estimates in the entire population. Compared with offspring born to fathers 20 to 24 years old, offspring of fathers 45 years and older were at heightened risk of autism (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.45; 95% CI, 1.62-7.33), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (HR = 13.13; 95% CI, 6.85-25.16), psychosis (HR = 2.07; 95% CI, 1.35-3.20), bipolar disorder (HR = 24.70; 95% CI, 12.12-50.31), suicide attempts (HR = 2.72; 95% CI, 2.08-3.56), substance use problems (HR = 2.44; 95% CI, 1.98-2.99), failing a grade (odds ratio [OR] = 1.59; 95% CI, 1.37-1.85), and low educational attainment (OR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.50-1.93) in within-sibling comparisons. Additional analyses using several quasi-experimental designs obtained commensurate results, further strengthening the internal and external validity of the findings. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Advancing paternal age is associated with increased risk of psychiatric and academic morbidity, with the magnitude of the risks being as large or larger than previous estimates.

However, little is known about the occurrence and characteristics of physician-adolescent discussions about sexuality. OBJECTIVE: To examine predictors of time spent discussing sexuality, level of adolescent participation, and physician and patient characteristics associated with sexuality discussions during health maintenance visits by early and middle adolescents.

Ordinal logistic regression (outcome of duration: 0, 1-35, or >/= 36 seconds), adjusted for clustering of patients within physicians, found that female patients (odds ratio [OR] = 2.58; 95% CI, 1.53-4.36), older patients (OR = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.13-1.65), conversations with explicit confidentiality discussions (OR = 4.33; 95% CI, 2.58-7.28), African American adolescents (OR = 1.58; 95% CI, 1.01-2.48), and longer overall visit (OR = 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03-1.11) were associated with more sexuality talk, and Asian physicians were associated with less sexuality talk (OR = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.08-0.20). In addition, the same significant associations between adolescent, physician, and visit characteristics were significantly associated with greater adolescent participation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our study may be the first to directly observe sexuality talk between physicians and adolescents. We found that one-third of all adolescents had annual visits without any mention of sexuality issues; when sexuality talk occurred, it was brief. Research is needed to identify successful strategies physicians can use to engage adolescents in discussions about sexuality to help promote healthy sexual development and decision making.

23857547,In-hospital and 1-year mortality in patients undergoing early surgery for prosthetic valve endocarditis.,JAMA Intern Med,Lalani T and Chu VH and Park LP and Cecchi E and Corey GR and Durante-Mangoni E and Fowler VG Jr and Gordon D and Grossi P and Hannan M and Hoen B and Munoz P and Rizk H and Kanj SS and Selton-Suty C and Sexton DJ and Spelman D and Ravasio V and Tripodi MF and Wang A,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: There are limited prospective, controlled data evaluating survival in patients receiving early surgery vs medical therapy for prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). OBJECTIVE: To determine the in-hospital and 1-year mortality in patients with PVE who undergo valve replacement during index hospitalization compared with patients who receive medical therapy alone, after controlling for survival and treatment selection bias. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were enrolled between June 2000 and December 2006 in the International Collaboration on Endocarditis-Prospective Cohort Study (ICE-PCS), a prospective, multinational, observational cohort of patients with infective endocarditis. Patients hospitalized with definite right- or left-sided PVE were included in the analysis. We evaluated the effect of treatment assignment on mortality, after adjusting for biases using a Cox proportional hazards model that included inverse probability of treatment weighting and surgery as a time-dependent covariate. The cohort was stratified by probability (propensity) for surgery, and outcomes were compared between the treatment groups within each stratum. INTERVENTIONS: Valve replacement during index hospitalization (early surgery) vs medical therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital and 1-year mortality. RESULTS: Of the 1025 patients with PVE, 490 patients (47.8%) underwent early surgery and 535 individuals (52.2%) received medical therapy alone. Compared with medical therapy, early surgery was associated with lower in-hospital mortality in the unadjusted analysis and after controlling for treatment selection bias (in-hospital mortality: hazard ratio [HR], 0.44 [95% CI, 0.38-0.52] and lower 1-year mortality: HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.49-0.67]). The lower mortality associated with surgery did not persist after adjustment for survivor bias (in-hospital mortality: HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.76-1.07] and 1-year mortality: HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.89-1.23]). Subgroup analysis indicated a lower in-hospital mortality with early surgery in the highest surgical propensity quintile (21.2% vs 37.5%; P = .03). At 1-year follow-up, the reduced mortality with surgery was observed in the fourth (24.8% vs 42.9%; P = .007) and fifth (27.9% vs 50.0%; P = .007) quintiles of surgical propensity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Prosthetic valve endocarditis remains associated with a high 1-year mortality rate. After adjustment for differences in clinical characteristics and survival bias, early valve replacement was not associated with lower mortality compared with medical therapy in the overall cohort. Further studies are needed to define the effect and timing of surgery in patients with PVE who have indications for surgery.","Aortic Valve/surgery Endocarditis, Bacterial/*mortality/*therapy Female Follow-Up Studies Heart Valve Prosthesis/*adverse effects Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation *Hospital Mortality Humans Male Middle Aged Mitral Valve/surgery Propensity Score Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Prosthesis-Related Infections/*mortality/*therapy Registries Time-to-Treatment"
24595777,Association between casino opening or expansion and risk of childhood overweight and obesity.,JAMA,Jones-Smith JC and Dow WH and Chichlowska K,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Economic resources have been inversely associated with risk of childhood overweight/obesity. Few studies have evaluated whether this association is a direct effect of economic resources or is attributable to unmeasured confounding or reverse causation. American Indian-owned casinos have resulted in increased economic resources for some tribes and provide an opportunity to test whether these resources are associated with overweight/obesity. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether openings or expansions of American Indian-owned casinos were associated with childhood overweight/obesity risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used repeated cross-sectional anthropometric measurements from fitness testing of American Indian children (aged 7-18 years) from 117 school districts that encompassed tribal lands in California between 2001 and 2012. Children in school districts encompassing American Indian tribal lands that either gained or expanded a casino were compared with children in districts with tribal lands that did not gain or expand a casino. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Per capita annual income, median annual household income, percentage of population in poverty, total population, child overweight/obesity (body mass index [BMI] >/=85th age- and sex-specific percentile) and BMI z score. RESULTS: Of the 117 school districts, 57 gained or expanded a casino, 24 had a preexisting casino but did not expand, and 36 never had a casino. The mean slots per capita was 7 (SD, 12) and the median was 3 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.3-8). Among districts where a casino opened or expanded, the mean change in slots per capita was 13 (SD, 19) and the median was 3 (IQR, 1-11). Forty-eight percent of the anthropometric measurements were classified as overweight/obese (11,048/22,863). Every casino slot machine per capita gained was associated with an increase in per capita annual income (beta = $541; 95% CI, $245-$836) and a decrease in percentage in poverty (beta = -0.6%; 95% CI, -1.1% to -0.20%) among American Indians living on tribal lands. Among American Indian children, every slot machine per capita gained was associated with a decreased probability of overweight/obesity by 0.19 percentage points (95% CI, -0.26 to -0.11 percentage points) and a decrease in BMI z score (beta = -0.003; 95% CI, -0.005 to -0.0002). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, opening or expanding a casino was associated with increased economic resources and decreased risk of childhood overweight/obesity. Given the limitations of an ecological study, further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms behind this association.","Adolescent Body Mass Index California/epidemiology Child Female *Gambling Humans Income *Indians, North American Male Obesity/*ethnology/prevention & control Overweight/*ethnology/prevention & control Ownership Risk Social Class"

A supplement of 400 IU of vitamin D per day is thought to support plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations between 40 and 50 nmol/L; some advocate 75 to 150 nmol/L for bone health. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of different dosages of vitamin D in supporting 25(OH)D concentrations in infants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Double-blind randomized clinical trial conducted among 132 one-month-old healthy, term, breastfed infants from Montreal, Quebec, Canada, between March 2007 and August 2010. Infants were followed up for 11 months ending August 2011 (74% completed study). INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to receive oral cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) supplements of 400 IU/d (n=39), 800 IU/d (n=39), 1200 IU/d (n=38), or 1600 IU/d (n=16). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a plasma 25(OH)D concentration of 75 nmol/L or greater in 97.5% of infants at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included 25(OH)D concentrations of 75 nmol/L or greater in 97.5% of infants at 6, 9, and 12 months; 25(OH)D concentrations of 50 nmol/L or greater across all times; growth; and whole body and regional bone mineral content. Data were analyzed by intention to treat using available data, logistic regression, and mixed-model analysis of variance. RESULTS: By 3 months, 55% (95% CI, 38%-72%) of infants in the 400-IU/d group achieved a 25(OH)D concentration of 75 nmol/L or greater vs 81%(95% CI, 65%-91%) in the 800-IU/d group, 92% (95% CI, 77%-98%) in the 1200-IU/d group, and 100% in the 1600-IU/d group. This concentration was not sustained in 97.5% of infants at 12 months in any of the groups. The 1600-IU/d dosage was discontinued prematurely because of elevated plasma 25(OH)D concentrations. All dosages established 25(OH)D concentrations of 50 nmol/L or greater in 97% (95% CI, 94%-100%) of infants at 3 months and sustained this in 98% (95% CI, 94%-100%) to 12 months. Growth and bone mineral content did not differ by dosage. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among healthy, term, breastfed infants, only a vitamin D supplement dosage of 1600 IU/d (but not dosages of 400, 800, or 1200 IU/d) increased plasma 25(OH)D concentration to 75 nmol/L or greater in 97.5% of infants at 3 months. However, this dosage increased 25(OH)D concentrations to levels that have been associated with hypercalcemia.

23632724,Association between efavirenz-based compared with nevirapine-based antiretroviral regimens and virological failure in HIV-infected children.,JAMA,Lowenthal ED and Ellenberg JH and Machine E and Sagdeo A and Boiditswe S and Steenhoff AP and Rutstein R and Anabwani G and Gross R,chop,"IMPORTANCE: Worldwide, the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) efavirenz and nevirapine are commonly used in first-line antiretroviral regimens in both adults and children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Data on the comparative effectiveness of these medications in children are limited. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether virological failure is more likely among children who initiated 1 or the other NNRTI-based HIV treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of children (aged 3-16 years) who initiated efavirenz-based (n = 421) or nevirapine-based (n = 383) treatment between April 2002 and January 2011 at a large pediatric HIV care setting in Botswana. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from initiation of therapy to virological failure. Virological failure was defined as lack of plasma HIV RNA suppression to less than 400 copies/mL by 6 months or confirmed HIV RNA of 400 copies/mL or greater after suppression. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis compared time to virological failure by regimen. Multivariable Cox regression controlled for age, sex, baseline immunologic category, baseline clinical category, baseline viral load, nutritional status, NRTIs used, receipt of single-dose nevirapine, and treatment for tuberculosis. RESULTS: With a median follow-up time of 69 months (range, 6-112 months; interquartile range, 23-87 months), 57 children (13.5%; 95% CI, 10.4%-17.2%) initiating treatment with efavirenz and 101 children (26.4%; 95% CI, 22.0%-31.1%) initiating treatment with nevirapine had virological failure. There were 11 children (2.6%; 95% CI, 1.3%-4.6%) receiving efavirenz and 20 children (5.2%; 95% CI, 3.2%-7.9%) receiving nevirapine who never achieved virological suppression. The Cox proportional hazard ratio for the combined virological failure end point was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.4-2.7; log rank P < .001, favoring efavirenz). None of the measured covariates affected the estimated hazard ratio in the multivariable analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among children aged 3 to 16 years infected with HIV and treated at a clinic in Botswana, the use of efavirenz compared with nevirapine as initial antiretroviral treatment was associated with less virological failure. These findings may warrant additional research evaluating the use of efavirenz and nevirapine for pediatric patients.","Adolescent Anti-Retroviral Agents/*therapeutic use Benzoxazines/*therapeutic use Botswana Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Drug Therapy, Combination Female HIV Infections/*drug therapy Humans Male Nevirapine/*therapeutic use RNA, Viral/*blood Regression Analysis Retrospective Studies Treatment Failure Viral Load"

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the effect of intraoperative high-dose dexamethasone on the incidence of major adverse events in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 4494 patients aged 18 years or older undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at 8 cardiac surgical centers in The Netherlands enrolled between April 13, 2006, and November 23, 2011. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone (n = 2239) or placebo (n = 2255). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. RESULTS: Of the 4494 patients who underwent randomization, 4482 (99.7%) could be evaluated for the primary outcome. A total of 157 patients (7.0%) in the dexamethasone group and 191 patients (8.5%) in the placebo group reached the primary study end point (relative risk, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67-1.01; absolute risk reduction, -1.5%; 95% CI, -3.0% to 0.1%; P = .07). Dexamethasone was associated with reductions in postoperative infection, duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation, and lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays. In contrast, dexamethasone was associated with higher postoperative glucose levels. CONCLUSION: In our trial of adults undergoing cardiac surgery, the use of intraoperative dexamethasone did not reduce the 30-day incidence of major adverse events compared with placebo.

24225817,Increasing organ donation in Hispanic Americans: the role of media and other community outreach efforts.,JAMA Surg,Salim A and Ley EJ and Berry C and Schulman D and Navarro S and Zheng L and Chan LS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The growing demand for organs continues to outpace supply. This gap is most pronounced in minority populations, who constitute more than 40% of the organ waiting list. Hispanic Americans are particularly less likely to donate compared with other minorities for reasons that remain poorly understood and difficult to change. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether outreach interventions that target Hispanic Americans improve organ donation outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective before-after study of 4 southern California neighborhoods with a high percentage of Hispanic American residents. We conducted cross-sectional telephone surveys before and 2 years after outreach interventions. Respondents 18 years or older were drawn randomly from lists of Hispanic surnames. Awareness, perceptions, and beliefs regarding organ donation and intent to donate were measured and compared before and after interventions. INTERVENTION: Television and radio commercials about organ donation and educational programs at 5 high schools and 4 Catholic churches. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number of survey participants who specify intent to donate. RESULTS: A total of 402 preintervention and 654 postintervention individuals participated in the surveys. We observed a significant increase in awareness of and knowledge about organ donation and a significant increase in the intent to donate (17.7% vs 12.1%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.06-2.26; P = .02]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Focused donor outreach programs sustain awareness and knowledge and can significantly improve intent to donate organs in the Hispanic American population. These programs should continue to be evaluated and implemented to influence donor registration.","Adolescent Adult Aged *Community-Institutional Relations Cross-Sectional Studies Female *Health Education Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice *Hispanic Americans Humans Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies Questionnaires *Radio *Television Tissue and Organ Procurement/*statistics & numerical data Young Adult"

23797306,Mortality for publicly reported conditions and overall hospital mortality rates.,JAMA Intern Med,McCrum ML and Joynt KE and Orav EJ and Gawande AA and Jha AK,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Federal efforts about public reporting and quality improvement programs for hospitals have focused primarily on a small number of medical conditions. Whether performance on these conditions accurately predicts the quality of broader hospital care is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether mortality rates for publicly reported medical conditions are correlated with hospitals' overall performance. METHODS: Using national Medicare data, we compared hospital performance at 2322 US acute care hospitals on 30-day risk-adjusted mortality, aggregated across the 3 publicly reported conditions (acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia), with performance on a composite risk-adjusted mortality rate across 9 other common medical conditions, a composite mortality rate across 10 surgical conditions, and both composites combined. We also examined the relationship between alternative surrogates of quality (hospital size and teaching status) and performance on these composite outcomes. RESULTS: Our sample included 6,670,859 hospitalizations for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries from 2008 through 2009. Hospitals in the top quartile of performance on publicly reported conditions had a 3.6% lower absolute risk-adjusted mortality rate on the combined medical-surgical composite than those in the bottom quartile (9.4% vs 13.0%; P < .001). These top performers on publicly reported conditions had 5 times greater odds of being in the top quartile on the overall combined composite risk-adjusted mortality rate (odds ratio [OR], 5.3; 95% CI, 4.3-6.5). Mortality rates for the index condition were predictive of medical (OR, 8.4; 95% CI, 6.8-10.3) and surgical (2.7; 2.2-3.3) performance when these groups were considered separately. In comparison, large size (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.4) and teaching status (2.4; 1.8-3.2) showed weaker relationships with overall hospital mortality rates.

Understanding national trends in prevalence and consumption is critical for prioritizing action and evaluating tobacco control progress. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of daily smoking by age and sex and the number of cigarettes per smoker per day for 187 countries from 1980 to 2012. DESIGN: Nationally representative sources that measured tobacco use (n = 2102 country-years of data) were systematically identified. Survey data that did not report daily tobacco smoking were adjusted using the average relationship between different definitions. Age-sex-country-year observations (n = 38,315) were synthesized using spatial-temporal gaussian process regression to model prevalence estimates by age, sex, country, and year. Data on consumption of cigarettes were used to generate estimates of cigarettes per smoker per day. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Modeled age-standardized prevalence of daily tobacco smoking by age, sex, country, and year; cigarettes per smoker per day by country and year. RESULTS: Global modeled age-standardized prevalence of daily tobacco smoking in the population older than 15 years decreased from 41.2% (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 40.0%-42.6%) in 1980 to 31.1% (95% UI, 30.2%-32.0%; P < .001) in 2012 for men and from 10.6% (95% UI, 10.2%-11.1%) to 6.2% (95% UI, 6.0%-6.4%; P < .001) for women. Global modeled prevalence declined at a faster rate from 1996 to 2006 (mean annualized rate of decline, 1.7%; 95% UI, 1.5%-1.9%) compared with the subsequent period (mean annualized rate of decline, 0.9%; 95% UI, 0.5%-1.3%; P = .003). Despite the decline in modeled prevalence, the number of daily smokers increased from 721 million (95% UI, 700 million-742 million) in 1980 to 967 million (95% UI, 944 million-989 million; P < .001) in 2012. Modeled prevalence rates exhibited substantial variation across age, sex, and countries, with rates below 5% for women in some African countries to more than 55% for men in Timor-Leste and Indonesia. The number of cigarettes per smoker per day also varied widely across countries and was not correlated with modeled prevalence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Since 1980, large reductions in the estimated prevalence of daily smoking were observed at the global level for both men and women, but because of population growth, the number of smokers increased significantly. As tobacco remains a threat to the health of the world's population, intensified efforts to control its use are needed.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Female Health Surveys Humans Male Middle Aged Prevalence Regression Analysis Smoking/*epidemiology Tobacco Products/*utilization World Health/*statistics & numerical data Young Adult"

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that overweight and obesity with and without metabolic syndrome are associated with increased risk of MI and IHD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We examined 71,527 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study and categorized them according to body mass index (BMI) as normal weight, overweight, or obese and according to absence or presence of metabolic syndrome. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hazard ratios for incident MI and IHD according to combinations of BMI category and absence or presence of metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: During a median of 3.6 years' follow-up, we recorded 634 incident MI and 1781 incident IHD events. For MI, multivariable adjusted hazard ratios vs normal weight individuals without metabolic syndrome were 1.26 (95% CI, 1.00-1.61) in overweight and 1.88 (95% CI, 1.34-2.63) in obese individuals without metabolic syndrome and 1.39 (95% CI, 0.96-2.02) in normal weight, 1.70 (95% CI, 1.35-2.15) in overweight, and 2.33 (95% CI, 1.81-3.00) in obese individuals with metabolic syndrome. For IHD, results were similar but attenuated. Normal weight vs overweight vs obesity and presence vs absence of metabolic syndrome did not interact on risk of MI or IHD (P = .90 and P = .44). Among individuals both with and without metabolic syndrome there were increasing cumulative incidences of MI and IHD from normal weight through overweight to obese individuals (log-rank trend P = .006 to P < .001). Although the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for MI in individuals with vs without metabolic syndrome was 1.54 (95% CI, 1.32-1.81) across all BMI categories, addition of metabolic syndrome to a multivariable model including BMI and other clinical characteristics improved the Harell C-statistic only slightly for risk of MI (comparison P = .03) but not for IHD (P = .41).

23108588,Body mass index in 1.2 million adolescents and risk for end-stage renal disease.,Arch Intern Med,Vivante A and Golan E and Tzur D and Leiba A and Tirosh A and Skorecki K and Calderon-Margalit R,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between adolescent body mass index (BMI) and future risk for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is not fully understood, nor is it known the extent to which this association is limited to diabetic ESRD. We evaluated the association between BMI in adolescence and the risk for all-cause, diabetic, and nondiabetic ESRD. METHODS: Medical data about 1 194 704 adolescents aged 17 years who had been examined for fitness for military service between January 1, 1967, and December 31, 1997, were linked to the Israeli ESRD registry in this nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study. Incident cases of treated ESRD between January 1, 1980, and May 31, 2010, were included. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for treated ESRD among study participants for their BMI at age 17 years, defined in accord with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention BMI for age and sex classification. RESULTS: During 30 478 675 follow-up person-years (mean [SD], 25.51 [8.77] person-years), 874 participants (713 male and 161 female) developed treated ESRD, for an overall incidence rate of 2.87 cases per 100 000 person-years. Compared with adolescents of normal weight, overweight adolescents (85th to 95th percentiles of BMI) and obese adolescents (>/=95th percentile of BMI) had an increased future risk for treated ESRD, with incidence rates of 6.08 and 13.40 cases per 100 000 person-years, respectively. In a multivariate model adjusted for sex, country of origin, systolic blood pressure, and period of enrollment in the study, overweight was associated with an HR of 3.00 (95% CI, 2.50-3.60) and obesity with an HR of 6.89 (95% CI, 5.52-8.59) for all-cause treated ESRD. Overweight (HR, 5.96; 95% CI, 4.41-8.06) and obesity (HR, 19.37; 95% CI, 14.13-26.55) were strong and independent risk factors for diabetic ESRD. Positive associations of overweight (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.71-2.74) and obesity (HR, 3.41; 95% CI, 2.42-4.79) with nondiabetic ESRD were also documented. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obesity in adolescents were associated with significantly increased risk for all-cause treated ESRD during a 25-year period. Elevated BMI constitutes a substantial risk factor for diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD.","Adolescent Adult *Body Mass Index Female Humans Incidence Israel/epidemiology Kidney Failure, Chronic/*epidemiology/etiology Male Obesity/complications/epidemiology Overweight/*complications/epidemiology Retrospective Studies Risk"
23778788,Parental cultural attitudes and beliefs regarding young children and television.,JAMA Pediatr,Njoroge WF and Elenbaas LM and Garrison MM and Myaing M and Christakis DA,uw,"IMPORTANCE: Research has shown that preschool-aged children spend considerable time with media, and risks and benefits for cognitive and behavioral outcomes exist depending on what is watched and how it is watched. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations among child race/ethnicity, parental beliefs/attitudes about television (TV) and child development, and TV viewing habits of young children, and to assess reasons for existing racial/ethnic disparities in children's media use. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Parents completed demographic questionnaires, reported on attitudes regarding media's risks and benefits to their children, and completed 1-week media diaries where they recorded all of the programs their children watched. Enrollment was from March 13, 2009, to April 12, 2010. The study was conducted at 2 metropolitan Seattle pediatric clinics and an academic practice network, each serving a diverse population of patients, and involved a community-based sample of 596 parents of children aged 3 to 5 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Parental beliefs/attitudes regarding screen time and TV viewing habits of young children. RESULTS: Overall, children watched an average (SD) of 462.0 (315.5) minutes of TV per week. African American children watched more TV per week than non-Hispanic white children (mean [SD], 638.0 [450.9] vs 431.0 [282.6] minutes; P < .01); however, these differences were no longer statistically significant after controlling for attitudes and demographic covariates (eg, family socioeconomic status). It is important to note that socioeconomic status confounded the results for race/ethnicity, and the association between race/ethnicity and media time across the sample was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for family socioeconomic status. However, significant differences were found between parents of ethnically/racially diverse children and parents of non-Hispanic white children regarding the perceived positive effects of TV viewing, even when parental education and family income were taken into account. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Differences in parental beliefs/attitudes regarding the effects of media on early childhood development may help explain growing racial/ethnic disparities in child media viewing/habits, but more research is needed to understand the cultural nuances of the observed differences.","*African Americans *Asian Americans *Attitude Child, Preschool *Cultural Characteristics *Culture *European Continental Ancestry Group Humans Male Parents/*psychology *Television/statistics & numerical data"
24190691,Improving parenting skills for families of young children in pediatric settings: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA Pediatr,Perrin EC and Sheldrick RC and McMenamy JM and Henson BS and Carter AS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Disruptive behavior disorders, such as attention-deficient/hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, are common and stable throughout childhood. These disorders cause long-term morbidity but benefit from early intervention. While symptoms are often evident before preschool, few children receive appropriate treatment during this period. Group parent training, such as the Incredible Years program, has been shown to be effective in improving parenting strategies and reducing children's disruptive behaviors. Because they already monitor young children's behavior and development, primary care pediatricians are in a good position to intervene early when indicated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of parent-training groups delivered to parents of toddlers in pediatric primary care settings. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted at 11 diverse pediatric practices in the Greater Boston area. A total of 273 parents of children between 2 and 4 years old who acknowledged disruptive behaviors on a 20-item checklist were included. INTERVENTION: A 10-week Incredible Years parent-training group co-led by a research clinician and a pediatric staff member. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reports and structured videotaped observations of parent and child behaviors conducted prior to, immediately after, and 12 months after the intervention. RESULTS: A total of 150 parents were randomly assigned to the intervention or the waiting-list group. An additional 123 parents were assigned to receive intervention without a randomly selected comparison group. Compared with the waiting-list group, greater improvement was observed in both intervention groups (P < .05). No differences were observed between the randomized and the nonrandomized intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Self-reports and structured observations provided evidence of improvements in parenting practices and child disruptive behaviors that were attributable to participation in the Incredible Years groups. This study demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of parent-training groups conducted in pediatric office settings to reduce disruptive behavior in toddlers.

23797808,Parent conversations about healthful eating and weight: associations with adolescent disordered eating behaviors.,JAMA Pediatr,Berge JM and Maclehose R and Loth KA and Eisenberg M and Bucchianeri MM and Neumark-Sztainer D,umn,"IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of weight-related problems in adolescents is high. Parents of adolescents may wonder whether talking about eating habits and weight is useful or detrimental. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between parent conversations about healthful eating and weight and adolescent disordered eating behaviors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis using data from 2 linked multilevel population-based studies. SETTING: Anthropometric assessments and surveys completed at school by adolescents and surveys completed at home by parents in 2009-2010. PARTICIPANTS: Socioeconomically and racially/ethnically diverse sample (81% ethnic minority; 60% low income) of adolescents from Eating and Activity in Teens 2010 (EAT 2010) (n = 2793; mean age, 14.4 years) and parents from Project Families and Eating and Activity in Teens (Project F-EAT) (n = 3709; mean age, 42.3 years). EXPOSURE Parent conversations about healthful eating and weight/size. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adolescent dieting, unhealthy weight-control behaviors, and binge eating. RESULTS: Mothers and fathers who engaged in weight-related conversations had adolescents who were more likely to diet, use unhealthy weight-control behaviors, and engage in binge eating. Overweight or obese adolescents whose mothers engaged in conversations that were focused only on healthful eating behaviors were less likely to diet and use unhealthy weight-control behaviors. Additionally, subanalyses with adolescents with data from 2 parents showed that when both parents engaged in healthful eating conversations, their overweight or obese adolescent children were less likely to diet and use unhealthy weight-control behaviors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Parent conversations focused on weight/size are associated with increased risk for adolescent disordered eating behaviors, whereas conversations focused on healthful eating are protective against disordered eating behaviors.",Adolescent *Body Weight *Communication Cross-Sectional Studies Eating Disorders/*epidemiology *Feeding Behavior Female Humans Male *Parent-Child Relations *Parents
23877236,Parents' experiences with pediatric care at retail clinics.,JAMA Pediatr,Garbutt JM and Mandrell KM and Allen M and Sterkel R and Epstein J and Kreusser K and O'Neil J and Sayre B and Sitrin H and Stahl K and Strunk RC,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Little is known about the use of retail clinics (RCs) for pediatric care. OBJECTIVE: To describe the rationale and experiences of families with a pediatrician who also use RCs for pediatric care. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study with 19 pediatric practices in a Midwestern practice-based research network. PARTICIPANTS: Parents attending the pediatrician's office. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Parents' experience with RC care for their children. RESULTS: In total, 1484 parents (91.9% response rate) completed the self-administered paper survey. Parents (23.2%) who used the RC for pediatric care were more likely to report RC care for themselves (odds ratio, 7.79; 95% CI, 5.13-11.84), have more than 1 child (2.16; 1.55-3.02), and be older (1.05; 1.03-1.08). Seventy-four percent first considered going to the pediatrician but reported choosing the RC because the RC had more convenient hours (36.6%), no office appointment was available (25.2%), they did not want to bother the pediatrician after hours (15.4%), or they thought the problem was not serious enough (13.0%). Forty-seven percent of RC visits occurred between 8 am and 4 pm on weekdays or 8 am and noon on the weekend. Most commonly, visits were reportedly for acute upper respiratory tract illnesses (sore throat, 34.3%; ear infection, 26.2%; and colds or flu, 19.2%) and for physicals (13.1%). While 7.3% recalled the RC indicating it would inform the pediatrician of the visit, only 41.8% informed the pediatrician themselves. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Parents with established relationships with a pediatrician most often took their children to RCs for care because access was convenient. Almost half the visits occurred when the pediatricians' offices were likely open.","Adolescent Adult *Ambulatory Care Facilities/utilization *Attitude to Health Child *Child Health Services/utilization Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies Female Health Care Surveys Health Services Accessibility Humans Infant Logistic Models Male Midwestern United States Parents/*psychology Pediatrics"
24942798,"Evidence of reproductive stoppage in families with autism spectrum disorder: a large, population-based cohort study.",JAMA Psychiatry,Hoffmann TJ and Windham GC and Anderson M and Croen LA and Grether JK and Risch N,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Few studies have examined the curtailment of reproduction (ie, stoppage) after the diagnosis of a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). OBJECTIVE: To examine stoppage in a large, population-based cohort of families in which a child has received a diagnosis of ASD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with ASD born from January 1, 1990, through December 31, 2003, were identified in the California Department of Developmental Services records, which were then linked to state birth certificates to identify full sibs and half-sibs and to obtain information on birth order and demographics. A total of 19,710 case families in which the first birth occurred within the study period was identified. These families included 39,361 individuals (sibs and half-sibs). Control individuals were randomly sampled from birth certificates and matched 2:1 to cases by sex, birth year, and maternal age, self-reported race/ethnicity, and county of birth after removal of children receiving services from the California Department of Developmental Services. Using similar linkage methods as for case families, 36,215 pure control families (including 75,724 total individuals) were identified that had no individuals with an ASD diagnosis. EXPOSURES: History of affected children. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Stoppage was investigated by comparing the reproductive behaviors of parents after the birth of a child with ASD vs an unaffected child using a survival analysis framework for time to next birth and adjusting for demographic variables. RESULTS: For the first few years after the birth of a child with ASD, the parents' reproductive behavior was similar to that of control parents. However, birth rates differed in subsequent years; overall, families whose first child had ASD had a second child at a rate of 0.668 (95% CI, 0.635-0.701) that of control families, adjusted for birth year, birth weight, maternal age, and self-reported maternal race/ethnicity. Results were similar when a later-born child was the first affected child in the family. Reproductive curtailment was slightly stronger among women who changed partners (relative rate for second-born children, 0.553 [95% CI, 0.498-0.614]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results provide the first quantitative assessment and convincing statistical evidence of reproductive stoppage related to ASD. These findings have implications for recurrence risk estimation and genetic counseling.",Missing
24154931,State parity laws and access to treatment for substance use disorder in the United States: implications for federal parity legislation.,JAMA Psychiatry,Wen H and Cummings JR and Hockenberry JM and Gaydos LM and Druss BG,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The passage of the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act and the 2010 Affordable Care Act incorporated parity for substance use disorder (SUD) treatment into federal legislation. However, prior research provides us with scant evidence as to whether federal parity legislation will hold the potential for improving access to SUD treatment. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of state-level SUD parity laws on state-aggregate SUD treatment rates and to shed light on the impact of the recent federal SUD parity legislation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a quasi-experimental study using a 2-way (state and year) fixed-effect method. We included all known specialty SUD treatment facilities in the United States and examined treatment rates from October 1, 2000, through March 31, 2008. Our main source of data was the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services, which provides facility-level information on specialty SUD treatment. INTERVENTIONS: State-level SUD parity laws during the study period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: State-aggregate SUD treatment rates in (1) all specialty SUD treatment facilities and (2) specialty SUD treatment facilities accepting private insurance. RESULTS: The implementation of any SUD parity law increased the treatment rate by 9% (P < .001) in all specialty SUD treatment facilities and by 15% (P = .02) in facilities accepting private insurance. Full parity and parity only if SUD coverage is offered increased the SUD treatment rate by 13% (P = .02) and 8% (P = .04), respectively, in all facilities and by 21% (P = .03) and 10% (P = .04), respectively, in facilities accepting private insurance. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We found a positive effect of the implementation of state SUD parity legislation on access to specialty SUD treatment. Furthermore, the positive association is more pronounced in states with more comprehensive parity laws. Our findings suggest that federal parity legislation holds the potential to improve access to SUD treatment.","Health Surveys/statistics & numerical data Humans Insurance, Health/*legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical data Mental Health/*legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical data Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act/legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical data Substance Abuse Treatment Centers/*legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical data Substance-Related Disorders/*therapy United States United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration/legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical data"

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We implemented an intervention guided by PCMH principles at a safety-net teaching clinic with resident physician providers. Two similar clinics served as controls. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Using a cross-sectional design, we measured the effect on patient and resident satisfaction using the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey and a validated teaching clinic survey, respectively. Both surveys were conducted at baseline and 1 year after the intervention. We also measured the effect on emergency department and hospital utilization. RESULTS: Following implementation of our intervention, the clinic's score on the National Committee for Quality Assurance's PCMH certification tool improved from 35 to 53 of 100 possible points, although our clinic did not achieve all must-pass elements to qualify as a PCMH. During the 1-year study period, 4676 patients were exposed to the intervention; 39.9% of these used at least 1 program component. Compared with baseline, patient-reported access and overall satisfaction improved to a greater extent in the intervention clinic, and the composite satisfaction rating increased from 48% to 65% in the intervention clinic vs from 50% to 59% in the control sites (P = .04). The improvements were particularly notable for questions relating to access. For example, satisfaction with urgent appointment scheduling increased from 12% to 53% in the intervention clinic vs from 14% to 18% in the control clinics (P < .001). Resident satisfaction also improved in the intervention clinic: the composite satisfaction score increased from 39% to 51% in the intervention clinic vs a decrease from 46% to 42% in the control clinics (P = .01). Emergency department utilization did not differ significantly between the intervention and control clinics, and hospitalizations increased from 26 to 27 visits per 1000 patients per month in the intervention clinic vs a decrease from 28 to 25 in the control clinics (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our PCMH-guided intervention, which represented a modest but substantive step toward the PCMH vision, had favorable effects on patient and resident satisfaction at a safety-net teaching clinic but did not reduce emergency department or hospital utilization in the first year. Our experience may provide lessons for other teaching clinics in safety-net settings hoping to implement PCMH-guided reforms.","*Ambulatory Care Facilities Appointments and Schedules Cross-Sectional Studies Delivery of Health Care/*organization & administration Education, Medical/*methods Female *Health Services Accessibility Humans Internship and Residency/*methods Male Middle Aged Patient Satisfaction Patient-Centered Care/*methods Safety-net Providers/*methods United States"
24570245,"Association between participation in a multipayer medical home intervention and changes in quality, utilization, and costs of care.",JAMA,Friedberg MW and Schneider EC and Rosenthal MB and Volpp KG and Werner RM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Interventions to transform primary care practices into medical homes are increasingly common, but their effectiveness in improving quality and containing costs is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To measure associations between participation in the Southeastern Pennsylvania Chronic Care Initiative, one of the earliest and largest multipayer medical home pilots conducted in the United States, and changes in the quality, utilization, and costs of care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two volunteering primary care practices participated in the pilot (conducted from June 1, 2008, to May 31, 2011). We surveyed pilot practices to compare their structural capabilities at the pilot's beginning and end. Using claims data from 4 participating health plans, we compared changes (in each year, relative to before the intervention) in the quality, utilization, and costs of care delivered to 64,243 patients who were attributed to pilot practices and 55,959 patients attributed to 29 comparison practices (selected for size, specialty, and location similar to pilot practices) using a difference-in-differences design. EXPOSURES: Pilot practices received disease registries and technical assistance and could earn bonus payments for achieving patient-centered medical home recognition by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Practice structural capabilities; performance on 11 quality measures for diabetes, asthma, and preventive care; utilization of hospital, emergency department, and ambulatory care; standardized costs of care. RESULTS: Pilot practices successfully achieved NCQA recognition and adopted new structural capabilities such as registries to identify patients overdue for chronic disease services. Pilot participation was associated with statistically significantly greater performance improvement, relative to comparison practices, on 1 of 11 investigated quality measures: nephropathy screening in diabetes (adjusted performance of 82.7% vs 71.7% by year 3, P < .001). Pilot participation was not associated with statistically significant changes in utilization or costs of care. Pilot practices accumulated average bonuses of $92,000 per primary care physician during the 3-year intervention. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A multipayer medical home pilot, in which participating practices adopted new structural capabilities and received NCQA certification, was associated with limited improvements in quality and was not associated with reductions in utilization of hospital, emergency department, or ambulatory care services or total costs over 3 years. These findings suggest that medical home interventions may need further refinement.","Adult Ambulatory Care/utilization Certification Chronic Disease/therapy Emergency Service, Hospital/utilization Female Health Care Costs/*trends Health Services/*utilization Humans Insurance Claim Review Male Middle Aged *Patient-Centered Care/economics/standards Pennsylvania Pilot Projects Primary Health Care/economics/*standards/utilization Quality Indicators, Health Care/*trends"
25141939,Access to Breast Reconstruction After Mastectomy and Patient Perspectives on Reconstruction Decision Making.,JAMA Surg,Morrow M and Li Y and Alderman AK and Jagsi R and Hamilton AS and Graff JJ and Hawley ST and Katz SJ,Missing,"Importance: Most women undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer do not undergo breast reconstruction. Objective: To examine correlates of breast reconstruction after mastectomy and to determine if a significant unmet need for reconstruction exists. Design, Setting, and Participants: We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries from Los Angeles, California, and Detroit, Michigan, for rapid case ascertainment to identify a sample of women aged 20 to 79 years diagnosed as having ductal carcinoma in situ or stages I to III invasive breast cancer. Black and Latina women were oversampled to ensure adequate representation of racial/ethnic minorities. Eligible participants were able to complete a survey in English or Spanish. Of 3252 women sent the initial survey a median of 9 months after diagnosis, 2290 completed it. Those who remained disease free were surveyed 4 years later to determine the frequency of immediate and delayed reconstruction and patient attitudes toward the procedure; 1536 completed the follow-up survey. The 485 who remained disease free at follow-up underwent analysis. Exposures: Disease-free survival of breast cancer. Main Outcomes and Measures: Breast reconstruction at any time after mastectomy and patient satisfaction with different aspects of the reconstruction decision-making process. Results: Response rates in the initial and follow-up surveys were 73.1% and 67.7%, respectively (overall, 49.4%). Of 485 patients reporting mastectomy at the initial survey and remaining disease free, 24.8% underwent immediate and 16.8% underwent delayed reconstruction (total, 41.6%). Factors significantly associated with not undergoing reconstruction were black race (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.16 [95% CI, 1.11-4.20]; P = .004), lower educational level (AOR, 4.49 [95% CI, 2.31-8.72]; P < .001), increased age (AOR in 10-year increments, 2.53 [95% CI, 1.77-3.61]; P < .001), major comorbidity (AOR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.01-5.11]; P = .048), and chemotherapy (AOR, 1.82 [95% CI, 0.99-3.31]; P = .05). Only 13.3% of women were dissatisfied with the reconstruction decision-making process, but dissatisfaction was higher among nonwhite patients in the sample (AOR, 2.87 [95% CI, 1.27-6.51]; P = .03). The most common patient-reported reasons for not having reconstruction were the desire to avoid additional surgery (48.5%) and the belief that it was not important (33.8%), but 36.3% expressed fear of implants. Reasons for avoiding reconstruction and systems barriers to care varied by race; barriers were more common among nonwhite participants. Residual demand for reconstruction at 4 years was low, with only 30 of 263 who did not undergo reconstruction still considering the procedure. Conclusions and Relevance: Reconstruction rates largely reflect patient demand; most patients are satisfied with the decision-making process about reconstruction. Specific approaches are needed to address lingering patient-level and system factors with a negative effect on reconstruction among minority women.",Missing
25142970,Characteristics and Associations of High-Mitotic-Rate Melanoma.,JAMA Dermatol,Shen S and Wolfe R and McLean CA and Haskett M and Kelly JW,Missing,"Importance: Mitotic rate is now recognized as having independent prognostic significance in melanoma survival. However, its clinicopathologic associations have not been the focus of any previous study. Objective: To identify a set of patient and tumor characteristics associated with high-mitotic-rate melanoma with the aim of facilitating the earlier detection of aggressive primary invasive melanoma. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study of patients from a multidisciplinary melanoma clinic based in a public hospital. A total of 2397 cases from January 2006 to December 2011 were reviewed by the Victorian Melanoma Service, and 1441 patients with 1500 primary invasive melanomas were included in the study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mitotic rate was measured as number of mitoses per mm2 and analyzed as ordered categories (0, <1, 1 and <2, 2, 3-4, 5-9, and >/=10) according to patient demographics, phenotypic markers, historical data, tumor presentation, and histopathologic features. Results: Melanomas with higher mitotic rates were more likely to occur in men (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.8), patients 70 years or older (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7-2.8), and those with a history of solar keratosis (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6). These melanomas occurred more frequently on the head and neck (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9) and presented more often as amelanotic (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.5) and rapidly growing (>/=2 mm/mo) lesions (OR, 12.5; 95% CI, 8.4-18.5). An association was seen with the nodular melanoma subtype (vs superficial spreading [reference]) (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.8-3.4), greater tumor thickness (vs </=1 mm [reference]) (>1-4 mm: OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 3.2-6.1; >4 mm: OR, 12.6; 95% CI, 7.5-21.1), and ulceration (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.7). These histopathologic features, along with amelanosis and rate of growth, remained as significant associations with high mitotic rate in the overall multivariate analysis. Conclusions and Relevance: High-mitotic-rate primary cutaneous melanoma is associated with aggressive histologic features and atypical clinical presentation. It has a predilection for the head and neck region and is more likely to be seen in elderly men with a history of cumulative solar damage who present clinically with rapidly developing disease.",Missing
24080851,A 3-year follow-up of sun behavior in patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma.,JAMA Dermatol,Idorn LW and Datta P and Heydenreich J and Philipsen PA and Wulf HC,Missing,"IMPORTANCE UV radiation (UVR) exposure is the primary environmental risk factor for developing cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). OBJECTIVE To measure changes in sun behavior from the first until the third summer after the diagnosis of CMM using matched controls as a reference. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Three-year follow-up, observational, case-control study performed from May 7 to September 22, 2009, April 17 to September 15, 2010, and May 6 to July 31, 2011, at a university hospital in Denmark of 21 patients with CMM and 21 controls matched to patients by sex, age, occupation, and constitutive skin type participated in the study. Exposure to UVR was assessed the first and second summers (n=20) and the first and third summers (n=22) after diagnosis. Data from 40 participants were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Exposure to UVR was assessed by personal electronic UVR dosimeters that measured time-related UVR in standard erythema dose (SED) and corresponding sun diaries (mean, 74 days per participant each participation year). RESULTS Patients' daily UVR dose and UVR dose in connection with various behaviors increased during follow-up (quantified as an increase in daily UVR dose each year; all days: mean, 0.3 SED; 95% CI, 0.05-0.5 SED; days with body exposure: mean, 0.6 SED; 95% CI, 0.07-1.2 SED; holidays: mean, 1.2 SED; 95% CI, 0.3-2.1 SED; days abroad: 1.9 SED; 95% CI, 0.4-3.4 SED; and holidays with body exposure: mean, 2.3 SED; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4 SED). After the second year of follow-up, patients' UVR dose was higher than that of controls, who maintained a stable UVR dose. No difference was found between groups in the number of days with body exposure or the number of days using sunscreen in the second and third years of follow-up.

OBJECTIVE To examine the surgical trends and outcomes of colorectal cancer treatment in the elderly. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A review of operative outcomes for colorectal cancer in the United States was conducted in a Nationwide Inpatient Sample from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2010. Patients were stratified within age groups of 45 to 64, 65 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79, 80 to 84, and 85 years and older. Postoperative complications and yearly trends were analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression was used to compare in-hospital mortality and morbidity between individual groups of patients 65 years and older and those aged 45 to 64 years while controlling for sex, comorbidities, procedure type, diagnosis, and hospital status. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In-hospital mortality and morbidity. RESULTS Among the estimated 1 043 108 patients with colorectal cancer sampled, 63.8% of the operations were performed on those 65 years and older and 22.6% on patients 80 years and older. Patients 80 years and older were 1.7 times more likely to undergo urgent admission than those younger than 65 years. Patients younger than 65 years accounted for 46.0% of the laparoscopies performed in the elective setting compared with 14.1% for patients 80 years and older. Mortality during the 10 years decreased by a mean of 6.6%, with the most considerable decrease observed in the population 85 years and older (9.1%). Patients 80 years and older had an associated $9492 higher hospital charge and an increased 2(1/2)-day length of stay vs patients younger than 65 years. Compared with patients aged 45 to 64 years, higher risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality was observed in patients with advancing age: 65 to 69 years (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.18-1.49), 70 to 74 years (2.02; 1.82-2.24), 75 to 79 years (2.51; 2.28-2.76), 80 to 84 years (3.15; 2.86-3.46), and 85 years and older (4.72; 4.30-5.18) (P &lt; .01). Compared with patients aged 45 to 64 years, higher risk-adjusted morbidity was noted in those with advancing age: 65 to 69 years (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.21-1.29), 70 to 74 years (1.40; 1.36-1.45), 75 to 79 years (1.54; 1.49-1.58), 80 to 84 years (1.68; 1.63-1.74), and 85 years and older (1.96; 1.89-2.03) (P &lt; .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most operations for colorectal cancer are performed on the aging population, with an overall decrease in the number of cases performed. Despite the overall improved mortality seen during the past 10 years, the risk-adjusted mortality and morbidity of the elderly continue to be substantially higher than that for the younger population.",Missing

Physician rating websites are becoming increasingly prevalent, and patients are using them to evaluate their current and future physicians. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patterns in online ratings of otolaryngologists. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From May 1, 2013, through June 1, 2013, lists of academic program faculty members in the Northeastern United States were compiled, and academic allopathic otolaryngologists from the Eastern Section of the Triological Society were identified. Each faculty member's name was searched using the Google search engine to link to profiles on the Healthgrades.com and Vitals.com websites. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: State, program, academic position, years in practice, subspecialty, ratings, and reviews were recorded. Ratings were compared using analysis of variance. RESULTS: A total of 281 faculty members from 25 programs were identified. A total of 266 otolaryngologists (94.7%) had a profile on Healthgrades, and 247 (87.9%) had a profile on Vitals. Of those with profiles, 186 (69.9%) and 202 (81.8%) had patient reviews on Healthgrades and Vitals, respectively. The mean score was 4.4 of 5.0 on Healthgrades and 3.4 of 4.0 on Vitals. On Vitals, 179 profiles (63.7%) had comments associated with them. Overall, 49 comments (27.3%) were determined to be negative, and 138 otolaryngologists (49.1%) had at least 1 negative comment. Academic position and subspecialty affected reviews on Healthgrades. State and years in practice did not influence reviews. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most patients use online resources for information on health care professionals. Physician perceptions of these sites tend to be negative. Awareness of the content and rating patterns may help physicians better manage their online reputation.",Internet *Online Systems Otolaryngology/*standards Patient Satisfaction/*statistics & numerical data United States

25201279,Use of Medications of Questionable Benefit in Advanced Dementia.,JAMA Intern Med,Tjia J and Briesacher BA and Peterson D and Liu Q and Andrade SE and Mitchell SL,Missing,"Importance: Advanced dementia is characterized by severe cognitive impairment and complete functional dependence. Patients' goals of care should guide the prescribing of medication during such terminal illness. Medications that do not promote the primary goal of care should be minimized. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of medications with questionable benefit used by nursing home residents with advanced dementia, identify resident- and facility-level characteristics associated with such use, and estimate associated medication expenditures. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study of medication use by nursing home residents with advanced dementia using a nationwide long-term care pharmacy database linked to the Minimum Data Set (460 facilities) between October 1, 2009, and September 30, 2010. Main Outcomes and Measures: Use of medication deemed of questionable benefit in advanced dementia based on previously published criteria and mean 90-day expenditures attributable to these medications per resident. Generalized estimating equations using the logit link function were used to identify resident- and facility-related factors independently associated with the likelihood of receiving medications of questionable benefit after accounting for clustering within nursing homes. Results: Of 5406 nursing home residents with advanced dementia, 2911 (53.9%) received at least 1 medication with questionable benefit (range, 44.7% in the Mid-Atlantic census region to 65.0% in the West South Central census region). Cholinesterase inhibitors (36.4%), memantine hydrochloride (25.2%), and lipid-lowering agents (22.4%) were the most commonly prescribed. In adjusted analyses, having eating problems (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.59-0.78), a feeding tube (AOR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.48-0.70), or a do-not-resuscitate order (AOR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.57-0.75), and enrolling in hospice (AOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58-0.82) lowered the likelihood of receiving these medications. High facility-level use of feeding tubes increased the likelihood of receiving these medications (AOR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.12-1.87). The mean (SD) 90-day expenditure for medications with questionable benefit was $816 ($553), accounting for 35.2% of the total average 90-day medication expenditures for residents with advanced dementia who were prescribed these medications. Conclusions and Relevance: Most nursing home residents with advanced dementia receive medications with questionable benefit that incur substantial associated costs.",Missing

We report key features of AD-related seizures and epileptiform activity that are instructive for clinical practice and highlight similarities between AD and transgenic animal models of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To describe common clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or early AD who also have epilepsy or subclinical epileptiform activity. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study from 2007 to 2012. SETTING Memory and Aging Center, University of California, San Francisco. PATIENTS: We studied 54 patients with a diagnosis of aMCI plus epilepsy (n = 12), AD plus epilepsy (n = 35), and AD plus subclinical epileptiform activity (n = 7). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical and demographic data, electroencephalogram (EEG) readings, and treatment responses to antiepileptic medications. RESULTS: Patients with aMCI who had epilepsy presented with symptoms of cognitive decline 6.8 years earlier than patients with aMCI who did not have epilepsy (64.3 vs 71.1 years; P = .02). Patients with AD who had epilepsy presented with cognitive decline 5.5 years earlier than patients with AD who did not have epilepsy (64.8 vs 70.3 years; P = .001). Patients with AD who had subclinical epileptiform activity also had an early onset of cognitive decline (58.9 years). The timing of seizure onset in patients with aMCI and AD was nonuniform (P < .001), clustering near the onset of cognitive decline. Epilepsies were most often complex partial seizures (47%) and more than half were nonconvulsive (55%). Serial or extended EEG monitoring appeared to be more effective than routine EEG at detecting interictal and subclinical epileptiform activity. Epileptic foci were predominantly unilateral and temporal. Of the most commonly prescribed antiepileptics, treatment outcomes appeared to be better for lamotrigine and levetiracetam than for phenytoin. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Common clinical features of patients with aMCI- or AD-associated epilepsy at our center included early age at onset of cognitive decline, early incidence of seizures in the disease course, unilateral temporal epileptic foci detected by serial/extended EEG, transient cognitive dysfunction, and good seizure control and tolerability with lamotrigine and levetiracetam.

24430320,"Prevalence of vascular complications among patients with glucokinase mutations and prolonged, mild hyperglycemia.",JAMA,Steele AM and Shields BM and Wensley KJ and Colclough K and Ellard S and Hattersley AT,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Glycemic targets in diabetes have been developed to minimize complication risk. Patients with heterozygous, inactivating glucokinase (GCK) mutations have mild fasting hyperglycemia from birth, resulting in an elevated glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level that mimics recommended levels for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between chronic, mild hyperglycemia and complication prevalence and severity in patients with GCK mutations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study in the United Kingdom between August 2008 and December 2010. Assessment of microvascular and macrovascular complications in participants 35 years or older was conducted in 99 GCK mutation carriers (median age, 48.6 years), 91 nondiabetic, familial, nonmutation carriers (control) (median age, 52.2 years), and 83 individuals with young-onset type 2 diabetes (YT2D), diagnosed at age 45 years or younger (median age, 54.7 years). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence and severity of nephropathy, retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, and cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: Median HbA1c was 6.9% in patients with the GCK mutation, 5.8% in controls, and 7.8% in patients with YT2D. Patients with GCK had a low prevalence of clinically significant microvascular complications (1% [95% CI, 0%-5%]) that was not significantly different from controls (2% [95% CI, 0.3%-8%], P=.52) and lower than in patients with YT2D (36% [95% CI, 25%-47%], P<.001). Thirty percent of patients with GCK had retinopathy (95% CI, 21%-41%) compared with 14% of controls (95% CI, 7%-23%, P=.007) and 63% of patients with YT2D (95% CI, 51%-73%, P<.001). Neither patients with GCK nor controls required laser therapy for retinopathy compared with 28% (95% CI, 18%-39%) of patients with YT2D (P<.001). Neither patients with GCK patients nor controls had proteinuria and microalbuminuria was rare (GCK, 1% [95% CI, 0.2%-6%]; controls, 2% [95% CI, 0.2%-8%]), whereas 10% (95% CI, 4%-19%) of YT2D patients had proteinuria (P<.001 vs GCK) and 21% (95% CI, 13%-32%) had microalbuminuria (P<.001). Neuropathy was rare in patients with GCK (2% [95% CI, 0.3%-8%]) and controls (95% CI, 0% [0%-4%]) but present in 29% (95% CI, 20%-50%) of YT2D patients (P<.001). Patients with GCK had a low prevalence of clinically significant macrovascular complications (4% [95% CI, 1%-10%]) that was not significantly different from controls (11% [95% CI, 5%-19%]; P=.09), and lower in prevalence than patients with YT2D (30% [95% CI, 21%-41%], P<.001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite a median duration of 48.6 years of hyperglycemia, patients with a GCK mutation had low prevalence of microvascular and macrovascular complications. These findings may provide insights into the risks associated with isolated, mild hyperglycemia.","Adult Case-Control Studies Cross-Sectional Studies *Diabetes Complications Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications/genetics Female Glucokinase/*genetics Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated/analysis Humans Hyperglycemia/complications/*genetics Male Middle Aged *Mutation Prevalence Severity of Illness Index Time Factors"
23168824,Association of online patient access to clinicians and medical records with use of clinical services.,JAMA,Palen TE and Ross C and Powers JD and Xu S,kp,"CONTEXT: Prior studies suggest that providing patients with online access to health records and e-mail communication with physicians may substitute for traditional health care services. OBJECTIVE: To assess health care utilization by both users and nonusers of online access to health records before and after initiation of MyHealthManager (MHM), a patient online access system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of the use of health care services by members (>/=18 years old) who were continuously enrolled for at least 24 months during the study period March 2005 through June 2010 in Kaiser Permanente Colorado, a group model, integrated health care delivery system. Propensity scores (using age, sex, utilization frequencies, and chronic illnesses) were used for cohort matching. Unadjusted utilization rates were calculated for both MHM users and nonusers and were the basis for difference-of-differences analyses. We also used generalized estimating equations to compare the adjusted rates of utilization of health care services before and after online access. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of office visits, telephone encounters, after-hours clinic visits, emergency department encounters, and hospitalizations between members with and without online access. RESULTS: Comparing the unadjusted rates for use of clinical services before and after the index date between the matched cohorts, there was a significant increase in the per-member rates of office visits (0.7 per member per year; 95% CI, 0.6-0.7; P < .001) and telephone encounters (0.3 per member per year; 95% CI, 0.2-0.3; P < .001). There was also a significant increase in per-1000-member rates of after-hours clinic visits (18.7 per 1000 members per year; 95% CI, 12.8-24.3; P < .001), emergency department encounters (11.2 per 1000 members per year; 95% CI, 2.6-19.7; P = .01), and hospitalizations (19.9 per 1000 members per year; 95% CI, 14.6-25.3; P < .001) for MHM users vs nonusers.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of providing post-ACS depression care on depressive symptoms and health care costs. DESIGN: Multicenter randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Patients were recruited from 2 private and 5 academic ambulatory centers across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 150 patients with elevated depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] score >/=10) 2 to 6 months after an ACS, recruited between March 18, 2010, and January 9, 2012. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to 6 months of centralized depression care (patient preference for problem-solving treatment given via telephone or the Internet, pharmacotherapy, both, or neither), stepped every 6 to 8 weeks (active treatment group; n = 73), or to locally determined depression care after physician notification about the patient's depressive symptoms (usual care group; n = 77). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in depressive symptoms during 6 months and total health care costs. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms decreased significantly more in the active treatment group than in the usual care group (differential change between groups, -3.5 BDI points; 95% CI, -6.1 to -0.7; P = .01). Although mental health care estimated costs were higher for active treatment than for usual care, overall health care estimated costs were not significantly different (difference adjusting for confounding, -$325; 95% CI, -$2639 to $1989; P = .78). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with post-ACS depression, active treatment had a substantial beneficial effect on depressive symptoms. This kind of depression care is feasible, effective, and may be cost-neutral within 6 months; therefore, it should be tested in a large phase 3 pragmatic trial.

OBJECTIVES: To identify common BP trajectories throughout early adulthood and to determine their association with presence of coronary artery calcification (CAC) during middle age. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort data from 4681 participants in the CARDIA study, who were black and white men and women aged 18 to 30 years at baseline in 1985-1986 at 4 urban US sites, collected through 25 years of follow-up (2010-2011). We examined systolic BP, diastolic BP, and mid-BP (calculated as [SBP+DBP]/2, an important marker of coronary heart disease risk among younger populations) at baseline and years 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25. Latent mixture modeling was used to identify trajectories in systolic, diastolic, and mid-BP over time. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Coronary artery calcification greater than or equal to Agatston score of 100 Hounsfield units (HU) at year 25. RESULTS: We identified 5 distinct mid-BP trajectories: low-stable (21.8%; 95% CI, 19.9%-23.7%; n=987), moderate-stable (42.3%; 40.3%-44.3%; n=2085), moderate-increasing (12.2%; 10.4%-14.0%; n=489), elevated-stable (19.0%; 17.1%-20.0%; n=903), and elevated-increasing (4.8%; 4.0%-5.5%; n=217). Compared with the low-stable group, trajectories with elevated BP levels had greater odds of having a CAC score of 100 HU or greater. Adjusted odds ratios were 1.44 (95% CI, 0.83-2.49) for moderate-stable, 1.86 (95% CI, 0.91-3.82) for moderate-increasing, 2.28 (95% CI, 1.24-4.18), for elevated-stable, and 3.70 (95% CI, 1.66-8.20) for elevated-increasing groups. The adjusted prevalence of a CAC score of 100 HU or higher was 5.8% in the low-stable group. These odds ratios represent an absolute increase of 2.7%, 5%, 6.3%, and 12.9% for the prevalence of a CAC score of 100 HU or higher for the moderate-stable, moderate-increasing, elevated-stable and elevated-increasing groups, respectively, compared with the low-stable group. Associations were not altered after adjustment for baseline and year 25 BP. Findings were similar for trajectories of isolated systolic BP trajectories but were attenuated for diastolic BP trajectories. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Blood pressure trajectories throughout young adulthood vary, and higher BP trajectories were associated with an increased risk of CAC in middle age.

24126743,Compensation of chief executive officers at nonprofit US hospitals.,JAMA Intern Med,Joynt KE and Le ST and Orav EJ and Jha AK,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Hospital chief executive officers (CEOs) can shape the priorities and performance of their organizations. The degree to which their compensation is based on their hospitals' quality performance is not well known. OBJECTIVE: To characterize CEO compensation and examine its relation with quality metrics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective observational study. Participants included 1877 CEOs at 2681 private, nonprofit US hospitals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We used linear regression to identify hospital structural characteristics associated with CEO pay. We then determined the degree to which a hospital's performance on financial metrics, technologic metrics, quality metrics, and community benefit in 2008 was associated with CEO pay in 2009. RESULTS: The CEOs in our sample had a mean compensation of $595,781 (median, $404,938) in 2009. In multivariate analyses, CEO pay was associated with the number of hospital beds overseen ($550 for each additional bed; 95% CI, 429-671; P < .001), teaching status ($425,078 more at major teaching vs nonteaching hospitals; 95% CI, 315,238-534,918; P < .001), and urban location. Hospitals with high levels of advanced technologic capabilities compensated their CEOs $135,862 more (95% CI, 80,744-190,990; P < .001) than did hospitals with low levels of technology. Hospitals with high performance on patient satisfaction compensated their CEOs $51,706 more than did those with low performance on patient satisfaction (95% CI, 15,166-88,247; P = .006). We found no association between CEO pay and hospitals' margins, liquidity, capitalization, occupancy rates, process quality performance, mortality rates, readmission rates, or measures of community benefit. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compensation of CEOs at nonprofit hospitals was highly variable across the country. Compensation was associated with technology and patient satisfaction but not with processes of care, patient outcomes, or community benefit.","Chief Executive Officers, Hospital/*economics Hospital Bed Capacity Hospitals, Teaching/*economics Hospitals, Urban/*economics Hospitals, Voluntary/*economics Humans Linear Models Multivariate Analysis Patient Satisfaction *Quality of Health Care Retrospective Studies Salaries and Fringe Benefits/*economics United States"
25029015,Association of Symptoms Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder vs Postconcussion Syndrome.,JAMA Psychiatry,Lagarde E and Salmi LR and Holm LW and Contrand B and Masson F and Ribereau-Gayon R and Laborey M and Cassidy JD,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: A proportion of patients experience long-lasting symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). The postconcussion syndrome (PCS), included in the DSM-IV, has been proposed to describe this condition. Because these symptoms are subjective and common to other conditions, there is controversy whether PCS deserves to be identified as a diagnostic syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether persistent symptoms 3 months following head injury are specific to MTBI or whether they are better described as part of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of injured patients recruited at the adult emergency department of the University Hospital of Bordeaux from December 4, 2007, to February 25, 2009. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: At 3-month follow-up, we compared the prevalence and risk factors for PCS and PTSD. Multiple correspondence analyses were used to assess clustering of symptoms and their associations with the type of injury. RESULTS: We included 534 patients with head injury and 827 control patients with other nonhead injuries. Three months following the trauma, 21.2% of head-injured and 16.3% of nonhead-injured patients fulfilled the DSM-IV diagnosis of PCS; 8.8% of head-injured patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for PTSD compared with 2.2% of control patients. In multivariate analysis, MTBI was a predictor of PTSD (odds ratio, 4.47; 95% CI, 2.38-8.40) but not of PCS (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.82-1.55). Correspondence analysis suggested that symptoms considered part of PCS behave similarly to PTSD symptoms in the hyperarousal dimension. None of these 22 symptoms showed any pattern of clustering, and no clear proximity with head or nonhead injury status could be found. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Persistent subjective symptoms frequently reported 3 months after MTBI are not specific enough to be identified as a unique PCS and should be considered part of the hyperarousal dimension of PTSD.",Missing
25162181,Efficacy of Photodynamic Therapy vs Other Interventions in Randomized Clinical Trials for the Treatment of Actinic Keratoses: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,JAMA Dermatol,Patel G and Armstrong AW and Eisen DB,Missing,"Importance: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is used extensively to treat actinic keratoses (AKs). An analysis of the effectiveness of PDT compared with other treatments may help physicians decide what role it should play in their own clinical practices. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of PDT for the treatment of AKs relative to other methods. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Central Register. No restrictions on years were placed, and all searches extended to the year of each database inception. Our search was conducted on March 20, 2013, and included the search terms solar keratosis, actinic keratosis, photodynamic therapy, and photochemotherapy. No restrictions were used for the search string. Study Selection: Only randomized PDT trials that used aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride or methyl aminolevulinate hydrochloride as stabilizers with 10 or more participants were considered. Two of the authors undertook the search independently. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted independently by the 2 authors. We assessed data quality using the Jadad scoring system and used a random-effects model for pooled data analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome measures specified a priori were lesion response, cosmetic results, and patient satisfaction after the intervention. Results: Our search identified 875 journal articles and meeting abstracts. We excluded 862 owing to lack of adherence to our inclusion criteria or lack of author response to our queries for further information. We assessed 13 studies for inclusion in our final synthesis, of which 4 were eligible for final meta-analysis. The only comparator for which meta-analysis was performed was cryotherapy. The meta-analysis consisted of 641 participants, with a total of 2174 AKs treated with cryotherapy and 2170 AKs treated with PDT. Compared with cryotherapy, the pooled relative risk for the meta-analysis for complete response (lesion clearance) was 1.14 (95% CI, 1.11-1.18) at 3 months after treatment. Visual inspection of a funnel plot revealed no publication bias, which was confirmed by the Begg test (P = .80). Conclusions and Relevance: Photodynamic therapy has a 14% better chance of complete lesion clearance at 3 months after treatment than cryotherapy for thin AKs on the face and scalp.",Missing

DESIGN: A comparative, prospective, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial of 3 types of physical exercise. SETTING: The Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Center at the University of Maryland and the Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center. PATIENTS: A total of 67 patients with Parkinson disease who had gait impairment were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 arms of the trial. INTERVENTIONS; (1) A higher-intensity treadmill exercise (30 minutes at 70%-80% of heart rate reserve), (2) a lower-intensity treadmill exercise (50 minutes at 40%-50% of heart rate reserve), and (3) stretching and resistance exercises (2 sets of 10 repetitions on each leg on 3 resistance machines [leg press, leg extension, and curl]). These exercises were performed 3 times a week for 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were gait speed (6-minute walk), cardiovascular fitness (peak oxygen consumption per unit time [$$ VO2], and muscle strength (1-repetition maximum strength). RESULTS: All 3 types of physical exercise improved distance on the 6-minute walk: lower-intensity treadmill exercise (12% increase; P=.001), stretching and resistance exercises (9% increase; P<.02), and higher-intensity treadmill exercise (6% increase; P=.07), with no between-group differences. Both treadmill exercises improved peak $$ VO2 (7%-8% increase; P<.05) more than did the stretching and resistance exercises. Only stretching and resistance improved muscle strength (16% increase; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The effects of exercise were seen across all 3 exercise groups. The lower-intensity treadmill exercise resulted in the greatest improvement in gait speed. Both the higher- and lower-intensity treadmill exercises improved cardiovascular fitness. Only the stretching and resistance exercises improved muscle strength. Therefore, exercise can improve gait speed, muscle strength, and fitness for patients with Parkinson disease.

OBJECTIVE: To determine efficacy of physical therapy on pain and physical function in patients with hip osteoarthritis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, placebo-controlled, participant- and assessor-blinded trial involving 102 community volunteers with hip pain levels of 40 or higher on a visual analog scale of 100 mm (range, 0-100 mm; 100 indicates worst pain possible) and hip osteoarthritis confirmed by radiograph. Forty-nine patients in the active group and 53 in the sham group underwent 12 weeks of intervention and 24 weeks of follow-up (May 2010-February 2013) INTERVENTIONS: Participants attended 10 treatment sessions over 12 weeks. Active treatment included education and advice, manual therapy, home exercise, and gait aid if appropriate. Sham treatment included inactive ultrasound and inert gel. For 24 weeks after treatment, the active group continued unsupervised home exercise while the sham group self-applied gel 3 times weekly. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were average pain (0 mm, no pain; 100 mm, worst pain possible) and physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, 0 no difficulty to 68 extreme difficulty) at week 13. Secondary outcomes were these measures at week 36 and impairments, physical performance, global change, psychological status, and quality of life at weeks 13 and 36. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients (94%) completed week 13 measurements and 83 (81%) completed week 36 measurements. The between-group differences for improvements in pain were not significant. For the active group, the baseline mean (SD) visual analog scale score was 58.8 mm (13.3) and the week-13 score was 40.1 mm (24.6); for the sham group, the baseline score was 58.0 mm (11.6) and the week-13 score was 35.2 mm (21.4). The mean difference was 6.9 mm favoring sham treatment (95% CI, -3.9 to 17.7). The function scores were not significantly different between groups. The baseline mean (SD) physical function score for the active group was 32.3 (9.2) and the week-13 score was 27.5 (12.9) units, whereas the baseline score for the sham treatment group was 32.4 (8.4) units and the week-13 score was 26.4 (11.3) units, for a mean difference of 1.4 units favoring sham (95% CI, -3.8 to 6.5) at week 13. There were no between-group differences in secondary outcomes (except greater week-13 improvement in the balance step test in the active group). Nineteen of 46 patients (41%) in the active group reported 26 mild adverse effects and 7 of 49 (14%) in the sham group reported 9 mild adverse events (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults with painful hip osteoarthritis, physical therapy did not result in greater improvement in pain or function compared with sham treatment, raising questions about its value for these patients.

23939411,Medicare payment for cognitive vs procedural care: minding the gap.,JAMA Intern Med,Sinsky CA and Dugdale DC,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Health care costs in the United States are rising rapidly, and consensus exists that we are not achieving sufficient value for this investment. Historically, US physicians have been paid more for performing costly procedures that drive up spending and less for cognitive services that may conserve costs and promote population health. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the Medicare payment gap between representative cognitive and procedural services, each requiring similar amounts of physician time. DESIGN: Observational analytical study comparing the hourly revenue generated by a physician performing cognitive services (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] code 99214) and billing by time with that generated by physicians performing screening colonoscopy (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System code G0121) or cataract extraction (CPT code 66984) for Medicare beneficiaries. SETTING: Outpatient medical practice. PARTICIPANTS: Medical care providers of outpatient services. EXPOSURE: Work relative-value unit assigned to physician services. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Payment for physician services. RESULTS: The revenue for physician time spent on 2 common procedures (colonoscopy and cataract extraction) was 368% and 486%, respectively, of the revenue for a similar amount of physician time spent on cognitive care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our analysis indicates that Medicare reimburses physicians 3 to 5 times more for common procedural care than for cognitive care and illustrates the financial pressures that may contribute to the US health care system's emphasis on procedural care. We demonstrate that 2 common specialty procedures can generate more revenue in 1 to 2 hours of total time than a primary care physician receives for an entire day's work.",Adult Aged Delivery of Health Care/*economics *Fee Schedules Female *Health Care Costs *Health Expenditures Humans Male Medicare/*economics Middle Aged Physicians/*economics Reimbursement Mechanisms/*economics Retrospective Studies United States
23753810,Association between district and state policies and US public elementary school competitive food and beverage environments.,JAMA Pediatr,Chriqui JF and Turner L and Taber DR and Chaloupka FJ,uic,"IMPORTANCE: Given the importance of developing healthy eating patterns during early childhood, policies to improve the elementary school food and beverage environments are critical. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between district and state policy and/or law requirements regarding competitive food and beverages and public elementary school availability of foods and beverages high in fats, sugars, and/or sodium. DESIGN AND SETTING: Multivariate, pooled, cross-sectional analysis of data gathered annually during elementary school years 2008-2009 through 2010-2011 in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Survey respondents at 1814 elementary schools (1485 unique) in 957 districts in 45 states (food analysis) and 1830 elementary schools (1497 unique) in 962 districts and 45 states (beverage analysis). EXPOSURES Competitive food and beverage policy restrictions at the state and/or district levels. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Competitive food and beverage availability. RESULTS Sweets were 11.2 percentage points less likely to be available (32.3% vs 43.5%) when both the district and state limited sugar content, respectively. Regular-fat baked goods were less available when the state law, alone and in combination with district policy, limited fat content. Regular-fat ice cream was less available when any policy (district, state law, or both) limited competitive food fat content. Sugar-sweetened beverages were 9.5 percentage points less likely to be available when prohibited by district policy (3.6% vs 13.1%). Higher-fat milks (2% or whole milk) were less available when prohibited by district policy or state law, with either jurisdiction's policy or law associated with an approximately 15 percentage point reduction in availability. CONCLUSIONS: Both district and state policies and/or laws have the potential to reduce in-school availability of high-sugar, high-fat foods and beverages. Given the need to reduce empty calories in children's diets, governmental policies at all levels may be an effective tool.","*Beverages Child Cross-Sectional Studies *Food Dispensers, Automatic *Food Services Health Policy/*legislation & jurisprudence Humans *Schools United States"
25133759,"Association of Poor Subjective Sleep Quality With Risk for Death by Suicide During a 10-Year Period: A Longitudinal, Population-Based Study of Late Life.",JAMA Psychiatry,Bernert RA and Turvey CL and Conwell Y and Joiner TE Jr,Missing,"Importance: Older adults have high rates of sleep disturbance, die by suicide at disproportionately higher rates compared with other age groups, and tend to visit their physician in the weeks preceding suicide death. To our knowledge, to date, no study has examined disturbed sleep as an independent risk factor for late-life suicide. Objective: To examine the relative independent risk for suicide associated with poor subjective sleep quality in a population-based study of older adults during a 10-year observation period. Design, Setting, and Participants: A longitudinal case-control cohort study of late-life suicide among a multisite, population-based community sample of older adults participating in the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly. Of 14 456 community older adults sampled, 400 control subjects were matched (on age, sex, and study site) to 20 suicide decedents. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary measures included the Sleep Quality Index, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, and vital statistics. Results: Hierarchical logistic regressions revealed that poor sleep quality at baseline was significantly associated with increased risk for suicide (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.14-1.69; P < .001) by 10 follow-up years. In addition, 2 sleep items were individually associated with elevated risk for suicide at 10-year follow-up: difficulty falling asleep (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.27-3.93; P < .01) and nonrestorative sleep (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.28-3.67; P < .01). Controlling for depressive symptoms, baseline self-reported sleep quality was associated with increased risk for death by suicide (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.63; P < .05). Conclusions and Relevance: Our results indicate that poor subjective sleep quality is associated with increased risk for death by suicide 10 years later, even after adjustment for depressive symptoms. Disturbed sleep appears to confer considerable risk, independent of depressed mood, for the most severe suicidal behaviors and may warrant inclusion in suicide risk assessment frameworks to enhance detection of risk and intervention opportunity in late life.",Missing
24247329,Rates of cardiopulmonary resuscitation training in the United States.,JAMA Intern Med,Anderson ML and Cox M and Al-Khatib SM and Nichol G and Thomas KL and Chan PS and Saha-Chaudhuri P and Fosbol EL and Eigel B and Clendenen B and Peterson ED,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Prompt bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) improves the likelihood of surviving an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Large regional variations in survival after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have been noted. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether regional variations in county-level rates of CPR training exist across the United States and the factors associated with low rates in US counties. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used a cross-sectional ecologic study design to analyze county-level rates of CPR training in all US counties from July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011. We used CPR training data from the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross, and the Health & Safety Institute. Using multivariable logistic regression models, we examined the association of annual rates of adult CPR training of citizens by these 3 organizations (categorized as tertiles) with a county's geographic, population, and health care characteristics. EXPOSURE: Completion of CPR training. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Rate of CPR training measured as CPR course completion cards distributed and CPR training products sold by the American Heart Association, persons trained in CPR by the American Red Cross, and product sales data from the Health & Safety Institute. RESULTS During the study period, 13.1 million persons in 3143 US counties received CPR training. Rates of county training ranged from 0.00% to less than 1.29% (median, 0.51%) in the lower tertile, 1.29% to 4.07% (median, 2.39%) in the middle tertile, and greater than 4.07% or greater (median, 6.81%) in the upper tertile. Counties with rates of CPR training in the lower tertile were more likely to have a higher proportion of rural areas (adjusted odds ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.10-1.15] per 5-percentage point [PP] change), higher proportions of black (1.09 [1.06-1.13] per 5-PP change) and Hispanic (1.06 [1.02-1.11] per 5-PP change) residents, a lower median household income (1.18 [1.04-1.34] per $10 000 decrease), and a higher median age (1.28 [1.04-1.58] per 10-year change). Counties in the South, Midwest, and West were more likely to have rates of CPR training in the lower tertile compared with the Northeast (adjusted odds ratios, 7.78 [95% CI, 3.66-16.53], 5.56 [2.63-11.75], and 5.39 [2.48-11.72], respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Annual rates of US CPR training are low and vary widely across communities. Counties located in the South, those with higher proportions of rural areas and of black and Hispanic residents, and those with lower median household incomes have lower rates of CPR training than their counterparts. These data contribute to known geographic disparities in survival of cardiac arrest and offer opportunities for future community interventions.",Adult Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/*education Cross-Sectional Studies Female Health Education/*statistics & numerical data Heart Arrest/*therapy Humans Male Retrospective Studies United States
24296904,Effects of home visits by paraprofessionals and by nurses on children: follow-up of a randomized trial at ages 6 and 9 years.,JAMA Pediatr,Olds DL and Holmberg JR and Donelan-McCall N and Luckey DW and Knudtson MD and Robinson J,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The Nurse-Family Partnership delivered by nurses has been found to produce long-term effects on maternal and child health in replicated randomized trials. A persistent question is whether paraprofessional home visitors might produce comparable effects. OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of prenatal and infancy/toddler home visits by paraprofessionals and by nurses on child development at child ages 6 and 9 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized trial in public and private care settings in Denver, Colorado, of 735 low-income women and their first-born children (85% of the mothers were unmarried; 47% were Hispanic, 35% were non-Hispanic white, 15% were African American, and 3% were American Indian/Asian). INTERVENTIONS: Home visits provided from pregnancy through child age 2 years delivered in one group by paraprofessionals and in the other by nurses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reports of children's internalizing, externalizing, and total emotional/behavioral problems, and tests of children's language, intelligence, attention, attention dysfunction, visual attention/task switching, working memory, and academic achievement. We hypothesized that program effects on cognitive-related outcomes would be more pronounced among children born to mothers with low psychological resources. We report paraprofessional-control and nurse-control differences with P < .10 given similar effects in a previous trial, earlier effects in this trial, and limited statistical power. RESULTS: There were no significant paraprofessional effects on emotional/behavioral problems, but paraprofessional-visited children born to mothers with low psychological resources compared with control group counterparts exhibited fewer errors in visual attention/task switching at age 9 years (effect size = -0.30, P = .08). There were no statistically significant paraprofessional effects on other primary outcomes. Nurse-visited children were less likely to be classified as having total emotional/behavioral problems at age 6 years (relative risk [RR] = 0.45, P = .08), internalizing problems at age 9 years (RR = 0.44, P = .08), and dysfunctional attention at age 9 years (RR = 0.34, P = .07). Nurse-visited children born to low-resource mothers compared with control-group counterparts had better receptive language averaged over ages 2, 4, and 6 years (effect size = 0.30, P = .01) and sustained attention averaged over ages 4, 6, and 9 years (effect size = 0.36, P = .006). There were no significant nurse effects on externalizing problems, intellectual functioning, and academic achievement. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children born to low-resource mothers visited by paraprofessionals exhibited improvement in visual attention/task switching. Nurse-visited children showed improved behavioral functioning, and those born to low-resource mothers benefited in language and attention but did not improve in intellectual functioning and academic achievement.

23299606,Effect of intravenous paracetamol on postoperative morphine requirements in neonates and infants undergoing major noncardiac surgery: a randomized controlled trial.,JAMA,Ceelie I and de Wildt SN and van Dijk M and van den Berg MM and van den Bosch GE and Duivenvoorden HJ and de Leeuw TG and Mathot R and Knibbe CA and Tibboel D,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Continuous morphine infusion as standard postoperative analgesic therapy in young infants is associated with unwanted adverse effects such as respiratory depression. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether intravenous paracetamol (acetaminophen) would significantly (>30%) reduce morphine requirements in neonates and infants after major surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Single-center, randomized, double-blind study conducted in a level 3 pediatric intensive care unit in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Patients were 71 neonates or infants younger than 1 year undergoing major thoracic (noncardiac) or abdominal surgery between March 2008 and July 2010, with follow-up of 48 hours. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received a loading dose of morphine 30 minutes before the end of surgery, followed by continuous morphine or intermittent intravenous paracetamol up to 48 hours postsurgery. Infants in both study groups received morphine (boluses and/or continuous infusion) as rescue medication on the guidance of the validated pain assessment instruments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was cumulative morphine dose (study and rescue dose). Secondary outcomes were pain scores and morphine-related adverse effects. RESULTS: The cumulative median morphine dose in the first 48 hours postoperatively was 121 (interquartile range, 99-264) mug/kg in the paracetamol group (n = 33) and 357 (interquartile range, 220-605) mug/kg in the morphine group (n = 38), P < .001, with a between-group difference that was 66% (95% CI, 34%-109%) lower in the paracetamol group. Pain scores and adverse effects were not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among infants undergoing major surgery, postoperative use of intermittent intravenous paracetamol compared with continuous morphine resulted in a lower cumulative morphine dose over 48 hours.

23740240,I COUGH: reducing postoperative pulmonary complications with a multidisciplinary patient care program.,JAMA Surg,Cassidy MR and Rosenkranz P and McCabe K and Rosen JE and McAneny D,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Postoperative pulmonary complications can be a devastating consequence of surgery. Validated strategies to reduce these adverse outcomes are needed. OBJECTIVES: To design, implement, and determine the efficacy of a suite of interventions for reducing postoperative pulmonary complications. DESIGN: A before-after trial comparing our National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) pulmonary outcomes before and after implementing I COUGH, a multidisciplinary pulmonary care program. SETTING: An urban, academic, safety-net hospital. PARTICIPANTS: All patients who underwent general or vascular surgery at our institution during a 1-year period before and after implementation of I COUGH. INTERVENTIONS: A multidisciplinary team developed a strategy to reduce pulmonary complications based on comprehensive patient and family education and a set of standardized electronic physician orders to specify early postoperative mobilization and pulmonary care. Designated by the acronym I COUGH, the program emphasizes incentive spirometry, coughing and deep breathing, oral care (brushing teeth and using mouthwash twice daily), understanding (patient and family education), getting out of bed at least 3 times daily, and head-of-bed elevation. Nursing and physician education promoted a culture of mobilization and I COUGH interventions. I COUGH was implemented for all general surgery and vascular surgery patients at our institution in August 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The NSQIP-reported incidence and risk-adjusted ratios of postoperative pneumonia and unplanned intubation, which NSQIP reports as observed-expected (OE) ratios for the 1-year period before implementing I COUGH and as odds ratios (ORs, statistically comparable to OE ratios) for the period after its implementation. RESULTS: Before implementation of I COUGH, our incidence of postoperative pneumonia was 2.6%, falling to 1.6% after its implementation, and risk-adjusted outcomes fell from an OE ratio of 2.13 to an OR of 1.58. The incidence of unplanned intubations was 2.0% before I COUGH and 1.2% after I COUGH, with risk-adjusted outcomes decreasing from an OE ratio of 2.10 to an OR of 1.31. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: I COUGH, a standardized postoperative care program emphasizing patient education, early mobilization, and pulmonary interventions, reduced the incidence of postoperative pneumonia and unplanned intubation among our patients.","Cohort Studies Comprehensive Health Care/*organization & administration Cough Female Hospitalization Humans Intubation, Intratracheal Lung Diseases/*prevention & control Male Patient Care Team/*organization & administration *Postoperative Care *Postoperative Complications Program Evaluation Respiration, Artificial"
24165922,The effects of poverty on childhood brain development: the mediating effect of caregiving and stressful life events.,JAMA Pediatr,Luby J and Belden A and Botteron K and Marrus N and Harms MP and Babb C and Nishino T and Barch D,Missing,"IMPORTANCE The study provides novel data to inform the mechanisms by which poverty negatively impacts childhood brain development. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the income-to-needs ratio experienced in early childhood impacts brain development at school age and to explore the mediators of this effect. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study was conducted at an academic research unit at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis. Data from a prospective longitudinal study of emotion development in preschool children who participated in neuroimaging at school age were used to investigate the effects of poverty on brain development. Children were assessed annually for 3 to 6 years prior to the time of a magnetic resonance imaging scan, during which they were evaluated on psychosocial, behavioral, and other developmental dimensions. Preschoolers included in the study were 3 to 6 years of age and were recruited from primary care and day care sites in the St Louis metropolitan area; they were annually assessed behaviorally for 5 to 10 years. Healthy preschoolers and those with clinical symptoms of depression participated in neuroimaging at school age/early adolescence. EXPOSURE Household poverty as measured by the income-to-needs ratio. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Brain volumes of children's white matter and cortical gray matter, as well as hippocampus and amygdala volumes, obtained using magnetic resonance imaging. Mediators of interest were caregiver support/hostility measured observationally during the preschool period and stressful life events measured prospectively. RESULTS Poverty was associated with smaller white and cortical gray matter and hippocampal and amygdala volumes. The effects of poverty on hippocampal volume were mediated by caregiving support/hostility on the left and right, as well as stressful life events on the left. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The finding that exposure to poverty in early childhood materially impacts brain development at school age further underscores the importance of attention to the well-established deleterious effects of poverty on child development. Findings that these effects on the hippocampus are mediated by caregiving and stressful life events suggest that attempts to enhance early caregiving should be a focused public health target for prevention and early intervention. Findings substantiate the behavioral literature on the negative effects of poverty on child development and provide new data confirming that effects extend to brain development. Mechanisms for these effects on the hippocampus are suggested to inform intervention.","Brain/*growth & development Caregivers Child *Child Development Depression/epidemiology/*etiology Female Humans *Life Change Events Longitudinal Studies Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Poverty/*statistics & numerical data Stress, Psychological Washington"

24643602,Risk of invasive Haemophilus influenzae infection during pregnancy and association with adverse fetal outcomes.,JAMA,Collins S and Ramsay M and Slack MP and Campbell H and Flynn S and Litt D and Ladhani SN,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Unencapsulated Haemophilus influenzae frequently causes noninvasive upper respiratory tract infections in children but can also cause invasive disease, especially in older adults. A number of studies have reported an increased incidence in neonates and suggested that pregnant women may have an increased susceptibility to invasive unencapsulated H. influenzae disease. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of invasive H. influenzae disease in women of reproductive age during a 4-year period. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Public Health England conducts enhanced national surveillance of invasive H. influenzae disease in England and Wales. Clinical questionnaires were sent prospectively to general practitioners caring for all women aged 15 to 44 years with laboratory-confirmed invasive H. influenzae disease during 2009-2012, encompassing 45,215,800 woman-years of follow-up. The final outcome was assessed in June 2013. EXPOSURES: Invasive H. influenzae disease confirmed by positive culture from a normally sterile site. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was H. influenzae infection and the secondary outcomes were pregnancy-related outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 171 women had laboratory-confirmed invasive H. influenzae infection, which included 144 (84.2%; 95% CI, 77.9%-89.3%) with unencapsulated, 11 (6.4%; 95% CI, 3.3%-11.2%) with serotype b, and 16 (9.4%; 95% CI, 5.4%-14.7%) with other encapsulated serotypes. Questionnaire response rate was 100%. Overall, 75 of 171 women (43.9%; 95% CI, 36.3%-51.6%) were pregnant at the time of infection, most of whom were previously healthy and presented with unencapsulated H. influenzae bacteremia. The incidence rate of invasive unencapsulated H. influenzae disease was 17.2 (95% CI, 12.2-24.1; P < .001) times greater among pregnant women (2.98/100,000 woman-years) compared with nonpregnant women (0.17/100,000 woman-years). Unencapsulated H. influenzae infection during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy was associated with fetal loss (44/47; 93.6% [95% CI, 82.5%-98.7%]) and extremely premature birth (3/47; 6.4% [95% CI, 1.3%-17.5%]). Unencapsulated H. influenzae infection during the second half of pregnancy was associated with premature birth in 8 of 28 cases (28.6%; 95% CI, 13.2%-48.7%) and stillbirth in 2 of 28 cases (7.1%; 95% CI, 0.9%-23.5%). The incidence rate ratio for pregnancy loss was 2.91 (95% CI, 2.13-3.88) for all serotypes of H. influenzae and 2.90 (95% CI, 2.11-3.89) for unencapsulated H. influenzae compared with the background rate for pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among women in England and Wales, pregnancy was associated with a greater risk of invasive H. influenzae infection.

24108418,Maternal depression during pregnancy and the postnatal period: risks and possible mechanisms for offspring depression at age 18 years.,JAMA Psychiatry,Pearson RM and Evans J and Kounali D and Lewis G and Heron J and Ramchandani PG and O'Connor TG and Stein A,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Some small studies suggest that maternal postnatal depression is a risk factor for offspring adolescent depression. However, to our knowledge, no large cohort studies have addressed this issue. Furthermore, only 1 small study has examined the association between antenatal depression and later offspring depression. Understanding these associations is important to inform prevention. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the hypothesis that there are independent associations between antenatal and postnatal depression with offspring depression and that the risk pathways are different, such that the risk is moderated by disadvantage (low maternal education) with postnatal depression but not with antenatal depression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective investigation of associations between symptoms of antenatal and postnatal parental depression with offspring depression at age 18 years in a UK community-based birth cohort (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) with data from more than 4500 parents and their adolescent offspring. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diagnosis of offspring aged 18 years with major depression using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. RESULTS: Antenatal depression was an independent risk factor. Offspring were 1.28 times (95% CI, 1.08-1.51; P = .003) more likely to have depression at age 18 years for each standard deviation increase in maternal depression score antenatally, independent of later maternal depression. Postnatal depression was also a risk factor for mothers with low education, with offspring 1.26 times (95% CI, 1.06-1.50; P = .01) more likely to have depression for each standard deviation increase in postnatal depression score. However, for more educated mothers, there was little association (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.88-1.36; P = .42). Analyses found that maternal education moderated the effects of postnatal but not antenatal depression. Paternal depression antenatally was not associated with offspring depression, while postnatally, paternal depression showed a similar pattern to maternal depression. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that treating maternal depression antenatally could prevent offspring depression during adulthood and that prioritizing less advantaged mothers postnatally may be most effective.","Adolescent Adult Cohort Studies Depression, Postpartum/diagnosis/*epidemiology Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology Educational Status England/epidemiology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Odds Ratio Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications/*epidemiology Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*epidemiology Risk Factors"
24061295,Early child development and exposure to antiepileptic drugs prenatally and through breastfeeding: a prospective cohort study on children of women with epilepsy.,JAMA Neurol,Veiby G and Engelsen BA and Gilhus NE,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Exposure to antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy is associated with adverse effects on psychomotor development. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether signs of impaired development appear already during the first months of life in children exposed prenatally to antiepileptic drugs, and to explore potential adverse effects of antiepileptic drug exposure through breastfeeding. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Mothers at 13 to 17 weeks of pregnancy were recruited in the population-based, prospective Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study from 1999 to 2009. The mothers reported on their child's motor and social skills, language, and behavior using items from standardized screening tools at 6 months (n = 78,744), 18 months (n = 61,351), and 36 months (n = 44,147) of age. The mothers also provided detailed information on breastfeeding during the first year. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The risk of adverse development in children according to maternal or paternal epilepsy was estimated as the odds ratio with corresponding 95% confidence interval, adjusted for maternal age, parity, education, smoking, breastfeeding, depression/anxiety, folate supplementation, and congenital malformation in the child. RESULTS: At age 6 months, infants of mothers using antiepileptic drugs (n = 223) had a higher risk of impaired fine motor skills compared with the reference group (11.5% vs 4.8%, respectively; odds ratio = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3-3.2). Use of multiple antiepileptic drugs compared with the reference group was associated with adverse outcome for both fine motor skills (25.0% vs 4.8%, respectively; odds ratio = 4.3; 95% CI, 2.0-9.1) and social skills (22.5% vs 10.2%, respectively; odds ratio = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.5). Continuous breastfeeding in children of women using antiepileptic drugs was associated with less impaired development at ages 6 and 18 months compared with those with no breastfeeding or breastfeeding for less than 6 months. At 36 months, prenatal antiepileptic drug exposure was associated with adverse development regardless of breastfeeding status during the first year. Children of women with epilepsy who did not use antiepileptic drugs and children of fathers with epilepsy had normal development at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Prenatal exposure to antiepileptic drugs was associated with impaired fine motor skills already at age 6 months, especially when the child was exposed to multiple drugs. There were no harmful effects of breastfeeding.

Animal studies indicate that prenatal exposure to nicotine alters the development of brain areas related to reward processing, which might be a risk factor for substance use and addiction later in life. However, no study has examined the effect of maternal smoking on the offspring's brain response during reward processing. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adolescents with prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking differ from their nonexposed peers in the response of the ventral striatum to the anticipation or the receipt of a reward. DESIGN: An observational case-control study. SETTING: Data were obtained from the IMAGEN Study, a European multicenter study of impulsivity, reinforcement sensitivity, and emotional reactivity in adolescents. The IMAGEN sample consists of 2078 healthy adolescents (age range, 13-15 years) recruited from March 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011, in local schools. PARTICIPANTS: We assessed an IMAGEN subsample of 177 adolescents with prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking and 177 nonexposed peers (age range, 13-15 years) matched by sex, maternal educational level, and imaging site. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Response to reward in the ventral striatum measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: In prenatally exposed adolescents, we observed a weaker response in the ventral striatum during reward anticipation (left side, F = 14.98 [P < .001]; right side, F = 15.95 [P < .001]) compared with their nonexposed peers. No differences were found regarding the responsivity of the ventral striatum to the receipt of a reward (left side, F = 0.21 [P = .65]; right side, F = 0.47 [P = .49]). CONCLUSIONS: The weaker responsivity of the ventral striatum to reward anticipation in prenatally exposed adolescents may represent a risk factor for substance use and development of addiction later in life. This result highlights the need for education and preventive measures to reduce smoking during pregnancy. Future analyses should assess whether prenatally exposed adolescents develop an increased risk for substance use and addiction and which role the reported neuronal differences during reward anticipation plays in this development.",Adolescent Basal Ganglia/drug effects/*physiopathology Case-Control Studies Female Functional Neuroimaging/methods Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging/instrumentation/methods Male Mothers Pregnancy Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*epidemiology/*psychology Retrospective Studies *Reward Risk Factors Smoking/*adverse effects/psychology Substance-Related Disorders/etiology/psychology

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between maternal use of prenatal folic acid supplements and subsequent risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) (autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified [PDD-NOS]) in children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The study sample of 85,176 children was derived from the population-based, prospective Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). The children were born in 2002-2008; by the end of follow-up on March 31, 2012, the age range was 3.3 through 10.2 years (mean, 6.4 years). The exposure of primary interest was use of folic acid from 4 weeks before to 8 weeks after the start of pregnancy, defined as the first day of the last menstrual period before conception. Relative risks of ASDs were estimated by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs in a logistic regression analysis. Analyses were adjusted for maternal education level, year of birth, and parity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Specialist-confirmed diagnosis of ASDs. RESULTS: At the end of follow-up, 270 children in the study sample had been diagnosed with ASDs: 114 with autistic disorder, 56 with Asperger syndrome, and 100 with PDD-NOS. In children whose mothers took folic acid, 0.10% (64/61,042) had autistic disorder, compared with 0.21% (50/24,134) in those unexposed to folic acid. The adjusted OR for autistic disorder in children of folic acid users was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.41-0.90). No association was found with Asperger syndrome or PDD-NOS, but power was limited. Similar analyses for prenatal fish oil supplements showed no such association with autistic disorder, even though fish oil use was associated with the same maternal characteristics as folic acid use. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Use of prenatal folic acid supplements around the time of conception was associated with a lower risk of autistic disorder in the MoBa cohort. Although these findings cannot establish causality, they do support prenatal folic acid supplementation.","Adolescent Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/*epidemiology/*prevention & control Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Dietary Supplements Female Folic Acid/*therapeutic use Humans Male Norway/epidemiology Odds Ratio Pregnancy Pregnancy Trimester, First Prenatal Care *Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects Regression Analysis Risk Vitamin B Complex/*therapeutic use Young Adult"
23044994,Prenatal exposure to mercury and fish consumption during pregnancy and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-related behavior in children.,Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med,Sagiv SK and Thurston SW and Bellinger DC and Amarasiriwardena C and Korrick SA,bu,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of prenatal mercury exposure and fish intake with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-related behavior. METHODS: For a population-based prospective birth cohort recruited in New Bedford, Massachusetts (1993-1998), we analyzed data for children examined at age 8 years with peripartum maternal hair mercury measures (n = 421) or maternal report of fish consumption during pregnancy (n = 515). Inattentive and impulsive/hyperactive behaviors were assessed using a teacher rating scale and neuropsychological testing. RESULTS: The median maternal hair mercury level was 0.45 mug/g (range, 0.03-5.14 mug/g), and 52% of mothers consumed more than 2 fish servings weekly. In multivariable regression models, mercury exposure was associated with inattention and impulsivity/hyperactivity; some outcomes had an apparent threshold with associations at 1 mug/g or greater of mercury. For example, at 1 mug/g or greater, the adjusted risk ratios for mild/markedly atypical inattentive and impulsive/hyperactive behaviors were 1.4 (95% CI, 1.0-1.8) and 1.7 (95% CI, 1.2-2.4), respectively, for an interquartile range (0.5 mug/g) mercury increase; there was no confounding by fish consumption. For neuropsychological assessments, mercury and behavior associations were detected primarily for boys. There was a protective association for fish consumption (>2 servings per week) with ADHD-related behaviors, particularly impulsive/hyperactive behaviors (relative risk = 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Low-level prenatal mercury exposure is associated with a greater risk of ADHD-related behaviors, and fish consumption during pregnancy is protective of these behaviors. These findings underscore the difficulties of balancing the benefits of fish intake with the detriments of low-level mercury exposure in developing dietary recommendations in pregnancy.","Adolescent Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*chemically induced/diagnosis/prevention & control Child *Diet/adverse effects Diet Surveys Female Food Contamination Hair/chemistry Humans Linear Models Male Massachusetts Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data Mercury/analysis/*toxicity Multivariate Analysis Pregnancy Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*chemically induced/diagnosis/prevention & control Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena Prospective Studies Psychological Tests Questionnaires *Seafood/adverse effects Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/*toxicity Young Adult"
23788030,Maternal prenatal smoking and hearing loss among adolescents.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Weitzman M and Govil N and Liu YH and Lalwani AK,nyumc,"IMPORTANCE: Although smoking and secondhand smoke exposure are associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in children and adults, the possible association between prenatal smoke exposure and hearing loss has not been investigated despite the fact that more than 12% of US children experience such prenatal exposure each year. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether exposure to prenatal tobacco smoke is independently associated with SNHL in adolescents. DESIGN: Cross-sectional data were examined for 964 adolescents aged 12 to 15 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006. PARTICIPANTS: Participants underwent standardized audiometric testing, and serum cotinine levels and self-reports were used to identify adolescents exposed to secondhand smoke or active smokers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prenatal exposure was defined as an affirmative parental response to, ""Did [Sample Person's Name] biological mother smoke at any time while she was pregnant with [him/her]?"" Sensorineural hearing loss was defined as an average pure-tone hearing level more than 15 dB for 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz (low frequency) and 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz (high frequency). RESULTS: Parental responses affirmed prenatal smoke exposure in 16.2% of 964 adolescents. Prenatal smoke exposure was associated with elevated pure-tone hearing thresholds at 2 and 6 kHz (P < .05), a higher rate of unilateral low-frequency SNHL (17.6% vs 7.1%; P < .05) in bivariate analyses, and a 2.6-fold increased odds of having unilateral low-frequency SNHL in multivariate analyses (95% CI, 1.1-6.4) after controlling for multiple hearing-related covariates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Prenatal smoke exposure is independently associated with higher pure-tone hearing thresholds and an almost 3-fold increase in the odds of unilateral low-frequency hearing loss among adolescents. These novel findings suggest that in utero exposure to tobacco smoke may be injurious to the auditory system.","Adolescent Adult Audiometry, Pure-Tone Chi-Square Distribution Cotinine/blood Cross-Sectional Studies Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural/*epidemiology Humans Logistic Models Male Nutrition Surveys Pregnancy *Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects Risk Factors Smoking/*adverse effects Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects United States/epidemiology"
23512061,"Comparison of presenting complaint vs discharge diagnosis for identifying "" nonemergency"" emergency department visits.",JAMA,Raven MC and Lowe RA and Maselli J and Hsia RY,ucsf,"IMPORTANCE: Reduction in emergency department (ED) use is frequently viewed as a potential source for cost savings. One consideration has been to deny payment if the patient's diagnosis upon ED discharge appears to reflect a ""nonemergency"" condition. This approach does not incorporate other clinical factors such as chief complaint that may inform necessity for ED care. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ED presenting complaint and ED discharge diagnosis correspond sufficiently to support use of discharge diagnosis as the basis for policies discouraging ED use. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The New York University emergency department algorithm has been commonly used to identify nonemergency ED visits. We applied the algorithm to publicly available ED visit data from the 2009 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) for the purpose of identifying all ""primary care-treatable"" visits. The 2009 NHAMCS data set contains 34,942 records, each representing a unique ED visit. For each visit with a discharge diagnosis classified as primary care treatable, we identified the chief complaint. To determine whether these chief complaints correspond to nonemergency ED visits, we then examined all ED visits with this same group of chief complaints to ascertain the ED course, final disposition, and discharge diagnoses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and disposition associated with chief complaints related to nonemergency ED visits. RESULTS: Although only 6.3% (95% CI, 5.8%-6.7%) of visits were determined to have primary care-treatable diagnoses based on discharge diagnosis and our modification of the algorithm, the chief complaints reported for these ED visits with primary care-treatable ED discharge diagnoses were the same chief complaints reported for 88.7% (95% CI, 88.1%-89.4%) of all ED visits. Of these visits, 11.1% (95% CI, 9.3%-13.0%) were identified at ED triage as needing immediate or emergency care; 12.5% (95% CI, 11.8%-14.3%) required hospital admission; and 3.4% (95% CI, 2.5%-4.3%) of admitted patients went directly from the ED to the operating room. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among ED visits with the same presenting complaint as those ultimately given a primary care-treatable diagnosis based on ED discharge diagnosis, a substantial proportion required immediate emergency care or hospital admission. The limited concordance between presenting complaints and ED discharge diagnoses suggests that these discharge diagnoses are unable to accurately identify nonemergency ED visits.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Algorithms Data Collection *Diagnosis Eligibility Determination Emergency Medical Services/*standards Emergency Service, Hospital/*utilization Female Health Care Surveys Humans Insurance Coverage International Classification of Diseases Male Middle Aged Patient Admission/statistics & numerical data Patient Discharge/*statistics & numerical data Primary Health Care Severity of Illness Index United States Young Adult"
24247736,Environmental phthalate exposure and preterm birth.,JAMA Pediatr,Ferguson KK and McElrath TF and Meeker JD,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal mortality, with a variety of contributing causes and risk factors. Environmental exposures represent a group of understudied, but potentially important, factors. Phthalate diesters are used extensively in a variety of consumer products worldwide. Consequently, exposure in pregnant women is highly prevalent. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between phthalate exposure during pregnancy and preterm birth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nested case-control study was conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. Women were recruited for a prospective observational cohort study from 2006-2008. Each provided demographic data, biological samples, and information about birth outcomes. From within this group, we selected 130 cases of preterm birth and 352 randomly assigned control participants, and we analyzed urine samples from up to 3 time points during pregnancy for levels of phthalate metabolites. EXPOSURE: Phthalate exposure during pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We examined associations between average levels of phthalate exposure during pregnancy and preterm birth, defined as fewer than 37 weeks of completed gestation, as well as spontaneous preterm birth, defined as preterm preceded by spontaneous preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of the membranes (n = 57). RESULTS: Geometric means of the di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites mono-(2-ethyl)-hexyl phthalate (MEHP) and mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), as well as mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), were significantly higher in cases compared with control participants. In adjusted models, MEHP, MECPP, and Sigma DEHP metabolites were associated with significantly increased odds of preterm birth. When spontaneous preterm births were examined alone, MEHP, mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, MECPP, Sigma DEHP, MBP, and mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate metabolite levels were all associated with significantly elevated odds of prematurity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Women exposed to phthalates during pregnancy have significantly increased odds of delivering preterm. Steps should be taken to decrease maternal exposure to phthalates during pregnancy.","Adult Case-Control Studies Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects Female Humans Infant, Newborn Massachusetts/epidemiology *Maternal Exposure Phthalic Acids/*adverse effects/urine Pregnancy Premature Birth/*chemically induced/urine Prospective Studies Risk Factors Young Adult"

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether preterm birth is associated with elevated plasma insulin levels at birth and whether this association persists into early childhood. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective birth cohort of 1358 children recruited at birth from 1998 to 2010 and followed-up with prospectively from 2005 to 2012 at the Boston Medical Center in Massachusetts. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Random plasma insulin levels were measured at 2 time points: at birth (cord blood) and in early childhood (venous blood). The median age was 1.4 years (interquartile range [IQR], 0.8-3.3) among 4 gestational age groups: full term (>/=39 wk), early term (37-38 wk), late preterm (34-36 wk), and early preterm (<34 wk). RESULTS: The geometric mean of insulin levels at birth were 9.2 microIU/mL (95% CI, 8.4-10.0) for full term; 10.3 microIU/mL (95% CI, 9.3-11.5) for early term; 13.2 microIU/mL (95% CI, 11.8-14.8) for late preterm; and 18.9 microIU/mL (95% CI, 16.6-21.4) for early preterm. In early childhood, these levels were 11.2 microIU/mL (95% CI, 10.3-12.0) for full term; 12.4 microIU/mL (95% CI, 11.3-13.6) for early term; 13.3 microIU/mL (95% CI, 11.9-14.8) for late preterm; and 14.6 microIU/mL (95% CI, 12.6-16.9) for early preterm. Insulin levels at birth were higher by 1.13-fold (95% CI, 0.97-1.28) for early term, 1.45-fold (95% CI, 1.25-1.65) for late preterm, and 2.05-fold (95% CI, 1.69-2.42) for early preterm than for those born full term. In early childhood, random plasma insulin levels were 1.12-fold (95% CI, 0.99-1.25) higher for early term, 1.19-fold (95% CI, 1.02-1.35) for late preterm, and 1.31-fold (95% CI, 1.10-1.52) for early preterm than those born full term. The association was attenuated after adjustment for postnatal weight gain and was not significant after adjustment for insulin levels at birth. Infants ranked in the top insulin tertile at birth were more likely to remain in the top tertile (41.2%) compared with children ranked in the lowest tertile (28.6%) in early childhood. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There was an inverse association between gestational age and elevated plasma insulin levels at birth and in early childhood. The implications for future development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes warrant further investigation.","Child, Preschool Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology Female Follow-Up Studies *Gestational Age Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature Insulin/*blood Insulin Resistance Male *Premature Birth Risk United States/epidemiology"
25138333,Sustained care intervention and postdischarge smoking cessation among hospitalized adults: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Rigotti NA and Regan S and Levy DE and Japuntich S and Chang Y and Park ER and Viana JC and Kelley JH and Reyen M and Singer DE,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Health care systems need effective models to manage chronic diseases like tobacco dependence across transitions in care. Hospitalizations provide opportunities for smokers to quit, but research suggests that hospital-delivered interventions are effective only if treatment continues after discharge. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intervention to sustain tobacco treatment after hospital discharge increases smoking cessation rates compared with standard care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial compared sustained care (a postdischarge tobacco cessation intervention) with standard care among 397 hospitalized daily smokers (mean age, 53 years; 48% were males; 81% were non-Hispanic whites) who wanted to quit smoking after discharge and received a tobacco dependence intervention in the hospital; 92% of eligible patients and 44% of screened patients enrolled. The study was conducted from August 2010 through November 2012 at Massachusetts General Hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Sustained care participants received automated interactive voice response telephone calls and their choice of free smoking cessation medication (any type approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) for up to 90 days. The automated telephone calls promoted cessation, provided medication management, and triaged smokers for additional counseling. Standard care participants received recommendations for postdischarge pharmacotherapy and counseling. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was biochemically confirmed past 7-day tobacco abstinence at 6-month follow-up after discharge from the hospital; secondary outcomes included self-reported tobacco abstinence. RESULTS: Smokers randomly assigned to sustained care (n = 198) used more counseling and more pharmacotherapy at each follow-up assessment than those assigned to standard care (n = 199). Biochemically validated 7-day tobacco abstinence at 6 months was higher with sustained care (26%) than with standard care (15%) (relative risk [RR], 1.71 [95% CI, 1.14-2.56], P = .009; number needed to treat, 9.4 [95% CI, 5.4-35.5]). Using multiple imputation for missing outcomes, the RR for 7-day tobacco abstinence was 1.55 (95% CI, 1.03-2.21; P = .04). Sustained care also resulted in higher self-reported continuous abstinence rates for 6 months after discharge (27% vs 16% for standard care; RR, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.15-2.51]; P = .007). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among hospitalized adult smokers who wanted to quit smoking, a postdischarge intervention providing automated telephone calls and free medication resulted in higher rates of smoking cessation at 6 months compared with a standard recommendation to use counseling and medication after discharge. These findings, if replicated, suggest an approach to help achieve sustained smoking cessation after a hospital stay.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate prevalence of nonrefractive visual impairment and to describe its relationship with demographic and systemic risk factors including diagnosed diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) examined a representative sample of the US noninstitutionalized population. In 1999-2002 and 2005-2008, 9471 and 10,480 participants aged 20 years or older received questionnaires, laboratory tests, and physical examinations. Visual acuity of less than 20/40 aided by autorefractor was classified as nonrefractive visual impairment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Nonrefractive visual impairment. RESULTS: Weighted prevalence of nonrefractive visual impairment increased 21% among US adults aged 20 years and older from 1.4% in 1999-2002 to 1.7% in 2005-2008 (P = .03); and increased 40% among non-Hispanic whites aged 20-39 years from 0.5% to 0.7% (P = .008). In multivariable analyses, statistically significant risk factors for nonrefractive visual impairment in 1999-2002 included age (per year odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.09), poverty (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.31-3.64), lack of insurance (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.16-2.95), and diabetes with 10 or more years since diagnosis (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.15-3.25). In 2005-2008, risk factors included age (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.07), poverty (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.55-3.22), education less than high school (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.54-2.90), and diabetes with 10 or more years since diagnosis (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.64-4.37).

Because a large number of ICDs in the United States are implanted in such patients, it is important to study survival associated with this therapy. OBJECTIVE: To characterize patients with LVEF between 30% and 35% and compare the survival of those with and without ICDs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD registry (January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2007) with an LVEF between 30% and 35% who received an ICD during a heart failure hospitalization and similar patients in the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure (GWTG-HF) database (January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009) with no ICD. The analysis was repeated in patients with an LVEF less than 30%. There were 3120 patients with an LVEF between 30% and 35% (816 in matched cohorts) and 4578 with an LVEF less than 30% (2176 in matched cohorts). Propensity score matching and Cox models were applied. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; data were obtained from Medicare claims through December 31, 2011. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the matched groups (n = 408 for both groups). Among patients with an LVEF between 30% and 35%, there were 248 deaths in the ICD Registry group, within a median follow-up of 4.4 years (interquartile range, 2.7-4.9) and 249 deaths in the GWTG HF group, within a median follow-up of 2.9 years (interquartile range, 2.1-4.4). The risk of all-cause mortality in patients with an LVEF between 30% and 35% and an ICD was significantly lower than that in matched patients without an ICD (3-year mortality rates: 51.4% vs 55.0%; hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69-0.99]; P = .04). Presence of an ICD also was associated with better survival in patients with an LVEF less than 30% (3-year mortality rates: 45.0% vs 57.6%; 634 and 660 total deaths; hazard ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.65-0.81]; P < .001) (P = .20 for interaction). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for heart failure and with an LVEF between 30% and 35% and less than 30%, survival at 3 years was better in patients who received a prophylactic ICD than in comparable patients with no ICD. These findings support guideline recommendations to implant prophylactic ICDs in eligible patients with an LVEF of 35% or less.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies *Defibrillators, Implantable Female Heart Failure/mortality/*therapy Humans Male Medicare/statistics & numerical data Propensity Score Registries Retrospective Studies Risk Survival Analysis United States *Ventricular Dysfunction, Left Ventricular Function, Left"

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of 2 decision aids in helping men make informed PCa screening decisions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A racially diverse group of male outpatients aged 45 to 70 years from 3 sites were interviewed by telephone at baseline, 1 month, and 13 months, from 2007 through 2011. We conducted intention-to-treat univariate analyses and multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses, adjusting for baseline outcome measures. INTERVENTION: Random assignment to print-based decision aid (n = 628), web-based interactive decision aid (n = 625), or usual care (UC) (n = 626). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prostate cancer knowledge, decisional conflict, decisional satisfaction, and whether participants underwent PCa screening. RESULTS: Of 4794 eligible men approached, 1893 were randomized. At each follow-up assessment, univariate and multivariable analyses indicated that both decision aids resulted in significantly improved PCa knowledge and reduced decisional conflict compared with UC (all P <.001). At 1 month, the standardized mean difference (Cohen's d) in knowledge for the web group vs UC was 0.74, and in the print group vs UC, 0.73. Decisional conflict was significantly lower for web vs UC (d = 0.33) and print vs UC (d = 0.36). At 13 months, these differences were smaller but remained significant. At 1 month, high satisfaction was reported by significantly more print (60.4%) than web participants (52.2%; P = .009) and significantly more web (P = .001) and print (P = .03) than UC participants (45.5%). At 13 months, differences in the proportion reporting high satisfaction among print (55.7%) compared with UC (49.8%; P = .06) and web participants (50.4%; P = .10) were not significant. Screening rates at 13 months did not differ significantly among groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Both decision aids improved participants' informed decision making about PCa screening up to 13 months later but did not affect actual screening rates.

24217336,Improving maternal mental health after a child's diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder: results from a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA Pediatr,Feinberg E and Augustyn M and Fitzgerald E and Sandler J and Ferreira-Cesar Suarez Z and Chen N and Cabral H and Beardslee W and Silverstein M,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of psychological distress among mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests a need for interventions that address parental mental health during the critical period after the child's autism diagnosis when parents are learning to navigate the complex system of autism services. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a brief cognitive behavioral intervention, problem-solving education (PSE), decreases parenting stress and maternal depressive symptoms during the period immediately following a child's diagnosis of ASD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial compared 6 sessions of PSE with usual care. Settings included an autism clinic and 6 community-based early intervention programs that primarily serve low-income families. Participants were mothers of 122 young children (mean age, 34 months) who recently received a diagnosis of ASD. Among mothers assessed for eligibility, 17.0% declined participation. We report outcomes after 3 months of follow-up (immediate postdiagnosis period). INTERVENTIONS: Problem-solving education is a brief, cognitive intervention delivered in six 30-minute individualized sessions by existing staff (early intervention programs) or research staff without formal mental health training (autism clinic). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were parental stress and maternal depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Fifty-nine mothers were randomized to receive PSE and 63 to receive usual care. The follow-up rate was 91.0%. Most intervention mothers (78.0%) received the full PSE course. At the 3-month follow-up assessment, PSE mothers were significantly less likely than those serving as controls to have clinically significant parental stress (3.8% vs 29.3%; adjusted relative risk [aRR], 0.17; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.65). For depressive symptoms, the risk reduction in clinically significant symptoms did not reach statistical significance (5.7% vs 22.4%; aRR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.10 to 1.08); however, the reduction in mean depressive symptoms was statistically significant (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology score, 4.6 with PSE vs 6.9 with usual care; adjusted mean difference, -1.67; 95% CI, -3.17 to -0.18). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The positive effects of PSE in reducing parenting stress and depressive symptoms during the critical postdiagnosis period, when parents are asked to navigate a complex service delivery system, suggest that it may have a place in clinical practice. Further work will monitor these families for a total of 9 months to determine the trajectory of outcomes.

23212498,Effect of a protected sleep period on hours slept during extended overnight in-hospital duty hours among medical interns: a randomized trial.,JAMA,Volpp KG and Shea JA and Small DS and Basner M and Zhu J and Norton L and Ecker A and Novak C and Bellini LM and Dine CJ and Mollicone DJ and Dinges DF,upenn,"CONTEXT: A 2009 Institute of Medicine report recommended protected sleep periods for medicine trainees on extended overnight shifts, a position reinforced by new Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and consequences of protected sleep periods during extended duty. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized controlled trial conducted at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center medical service and Oncology Unit of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (2009-2010). Of the 106 interns and senior medical students who consented, 3 were not scheduled on any study rotations. Among the others, 44 worked at the VA center, 16 at the university hospital, and 43 at both. INTERVENTION: Twelve 4-week blocks were randomly assigned to either a standard intern schedule (extended duty overnight shifts of up to 30 hours; equivalent to 1200 overnight intern shifts at each site), or a protected sleep period (protected time from 12:30 AM to 5:30 AM with handover of work cell phone; equivalent to 1200 overnight intern shifts at each site). Participants were asked to wear wrist actigraphs and complete sleep diaries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was hours slept during the protected period on extended duty overnight shifts. Secondary outcome measures included hours slept during a 24-hour period (noon to noon) by day of call cycle and Karolinska sleepiness scale. RESULTS: For 98.3% of on-call nights, cell phones were signed out as designed. At the VA center, participants with protected sleep had a mean 2.86 hours (95% CI, 2.57-3.10 hours) of sleep vs 1.98 hours (95% CI, 1.68-2.28 hours) among those who did not have protected hours of sleep (P < .001). At the university hospital, participants with protected sleep had a mean 3.04 hours (95% CI, 2.77-3.45 hours) of sleep vs 2.04 hours (95% CI, 1.79-2.24) among those who did not have protected sleep (P < .001). Participants with protected sleep were significantly less likely to have call nights with no sleep: 5.8% (95% CI, 3.0%-8.5%) vs 18.6% (95% CI, 13.9%-23.2%) at the VA center (P < .001) and 5.9% (95% CI, 3.1%-8.7%) vs 14.2% (95% CI, 9.9%-18.4%) at the university hospital (P = .001). Participants felt less sleepy after on-call nights in the intervention group, with Karolinska sleepiness scale scores of 6.65 (95% CI, 6.35-6.97) vs 7.10 (95% CI, 6.85-7.33; P = .01) at the VA center and 5.91 (95% CI, 5.64-6.16) vs 6.79 (95% CI, 6.57-7.04; P < .001) at the university hospital. CONCLUSIONS: For internal medicine services at 2 hospitals, implementation of a protected sleep period while on call resulted in an increase in overnight sleep duration and improved alertness the next morning.

25023650,Physician variation in management of low-risk prostate cancer: a population-based cohort study.,JAMA Intern Med,Hoffman KE and Niu J and Shen Y and Jiang J and Davis JW and Kim J and Kuban DA and Perkins GH and Shah JB and Smith GL and Volk RJ and Buchholz TA and Giordano SH and Smith BD,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Up-front treatment of older men with low-risk prostate cancer can cause morbidity without clear survival benefit; however, most such patients receive treatment instead of observation. The impact of physicians on the management approach is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of physicians on the management of low-risk prostate cancer with up-front treatment vs observation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort of men 66 years and older with low-risk prostate cancer diagnosed from 2006 through 2009. Patient and tumor characteristics were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries. The diagnosing urologist, consulting radiation oncologist, cancer-directed therapy, and comorbid medical conditions were determined from linked Medicare claims. Physician characteristics were obtained from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile. Mixed-effects models were used to evaluate management variation and factors associated with observation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: No cancer-directed therapy within 12 months of diagnosis (observation). RESULTS: A total of 2145 urologists diagnosed low-risk prostate cancer in 12 068 men, of whom 80.1% received treatment and 19.9% were observed. The case-adjusted rate of observation varied widely across urologists, ranging from 4.5% to 64.2% of patients. The diagnosing urologist accounted for 16.1% of the variation in up-front treatment vs observation, whereas patient and tumor characteristics accounted for 7.9% of this variation. After adjustment for patient and tumor characteristics, urologists who treat non-low-risk prostate cancer (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.55-0.92]; P = .01) and graduated in earlier decades (P = .004) were less likely to manage low-risk disease with observation. Treated patients were more likely to undergo prostatectomy (aOR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.45-2.01]; P < .001), cryotherapy (aOR, 28.2 [95% CI, 19.5-40.9]; P < .001), brachytherapy (aOR, 3.41 [95% CI, 2.96-3.93]; P < .001), or external-beam radiotherapy (aOR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.08-1.58]; P = .005) if their urologist billed for that treatment. Case-adjusted rates of observation also varied across consulting radiation oncologists, ranging from 2.2% to 46.8% of patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Rates of management of low-risk prostate cancer with observation varied widely across urologists and radiation oncologists. Patients whose diagnosis was made by urologists who treated prostate cancer were more likely to receive up-front treatment and, when treated, more likely to receive a treatment that their urologist performed. Public reporting of physicians' cancer management profiles would enable informed selection of physicians to diagnose and manage prostate cancer.",Missing
25042290,Effect of providing conditional economic compensation on uptake of voluntary medical male circumcision in Kenya: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Thirumurthy H and Masters SH and Rao S and Bronson MA and Lanham M and Omanga E and Evens E and Agot K,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Novel strategies are needed to increase the uptake of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) in sub-Saharan Africa and enhance the effectiveness of male circumcision as an HIV prevention strategy. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether small economic incentives could increase circumcision prevalence by addressing reported economic barriers to VMMC and behavioral factors such as present-biased decision making. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial conducted between June 22, 2013, and February 4, 2014, among 1504 uncircumcised men aged 25 to 49 years in Nyanza region, Kenya. VMMC services were provided free of charge and participants were randomized to 1 of 3 intervention groups or a control group. INTERVENTIONS: Participants in the 3 intervention groups received varying amounts of compensation conditional on undergoing circumcision at 1 of 9 study clinics within 2 months of enrollment. Compensation took the form of food vouchers worth 200 Kenya shillings ( approximately US $2.50), 700 Kenya shillings ( approximately US $8.75), or 1200 Kenya shillings ( approximately US $15.00), which reflected a portion of transportation costs and lost wages associated with getting circumcised. The control group received no compensation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: VMMC uptake within 2 months. RESULTS: Analysis of data for 1502 participants with complete data showed that VMMC uptake within 2 months was higher in the US $8.75 group (6.6%; 95% CI, 4.3%-9.5% [25 of 381]) and the US $15.00 group (9.0%; 95% CI, 6.3%-12.4% [34 of 377]) than in the US $2.50 group (1.9%; 95% CI, 0.8%-3.8% [7 of 374]) and the control group (1.6%; 95% CI, 0.6%-3.5% [6 of 370]). In logistic regression analysis, the US $8.75 group had significantly higher VMMC uptake than the control group (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.3; 95% CI, 1.7-10.7), as did the US $15.00 group (AOR 6.2; 95% CI, 2.6-15.0). Effect sizes for the US $8.75 and US $15.00 groups did not differ significantly (P = .20). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among uncircumcised men in Kenya, compensation in the form of food vouchers worth approximately US $8.75 or US $15.00, compared with lesser or no compensation, resulted in a modest increase in the prevalence of circumcision after 2 months. The effects of more intense promotion or longer implementation require further investigation.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether providing early PN to critically ill adults with relative contraindications to early EN alters outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, randomized, single-blind clinical trial conducted between October 2006 and June 2011 in ICUs of 31 community and tertiary hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. Participants were critically ill adults with relative contraindications to early EN who were expected to remain in the ICU longer than 2 days. INTERVENTIONS: Random allocation to pragmatic standard care or early PN. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Day-60 mortality; quality of life, infections, and body composition. RESULTS: A total of 1372 patients were randomized (686 to standard care, 686 to early PN). Of 682 patients receiving standard care, 199 patients (29.2%) initially commenced EN, 186 patients (27.3%) initially commenced PN, and 278 patients (40.8%) remained unfed. Time to EN or PN in patients receiving standard care was 2.8 days (95% CI, 2.3 to 3.4). Patients receiving early PN commenced PN a mean of 44 minutes after enrollment (95% CI, 36 to 55). Day-60 mortality did not differ significantly (22.8% for standard care vs 21.5% for early PN; risk difference, -1.26%; 95% CI, -6.6 to 4.1; P = .60). Early PN patients rated day-60 quality of life (RAND-36 General Health Status) statistically, but not clinically meaningfully, higher (45.5 for standard care vs 49.8 for early PN; mean difference, 4.3; 95% CI, 0.95 to 7.58; P = .01). Early PN patients required fewer days of invasive ventilation (7.73 vs 7.26 days per 10 patient x ICU days, risk difference, -0.47; 95% CI, -0.82 to -0.11; P = .01) and, based on Subjective Global Assessment, experienced less muscle wasting (0.43 vs 0.27 score increase per week; mean difference, -0.16; 95% CI, -0.28 to -0.038; P = .01) and fat loss (0.44 vs 0.31 score increase per week; mean difference, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.25 to -0.01; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The provision of early PN to critically ill adults with relative contraindications to early EN, compared with standard care, did not result in a difference in day-60 mortality. The early PN strategy resulted in significantly fewer days of invasive ventilation but not significantly shorter ICU or hospital stays.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of major medical comorbidity in patients with mild, moderate, or severe psoriasis, classified objectively based on body surface area involvement, compared with that in patients without psoriasis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cross-sectional study of patient data from United Kingdom-based electronic medical records; analysis included 9035 patients aged 25 to 64 years with psoriasis and 90,350 age- and practice-matched patients without psoriasis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of major medical comorbidity included in the Charlson comorbidity index. RESULTS: Among patients with psoriasis, 51.8%, 35.8%, and 12.4%, respectively, had mild, moderate, or severe disease based on body surface area criteria. The mean Charlson comorbidity index was increasingly higher in patients with mild (0.375 vs 0.347), moderate (0.398 vs 0.342), or severe psoriasis (0.450 vs 0.348) (each P < .05). Psoriasis overall was associated with higher prevalence of chronic pulmonary disease (adjusted odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.15), diabetes mellitus (1.22; 1.11-1.35), diabetes with systemic complications (1.34; 1.11-1.62), mild liver disease (1.41; 1.12-1.76), myocardial infarction (1.34; 1.07-1.69), peptic ulcer disease (1.27; 1.03-1.58), peripheral vascular disease (1.38; 1.07-1.77), renal disease (1.28; 1.11-1.48), and rheumatologic disease (2.04; 1.71-2.42). Trend analysis revealed significant associations between psoriasis severity and each of the above comorbid diseases (each P < .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The burdens of overall medical comorbidity and of specific comorbid diseases increase with increasing disease severity among patients with psoriasis.

OBJECTIVE: To describe recent trends in acceptance of insurance by psychiatrists compared with physicians in other specialties. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data from a national survey of office-based physicians in the United States to calculate rates of acceptance of private noncapitated insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid by psychiatrists vs physicians in other specialties and to compare characteristics of psychiatrists who accepted insurance and those who did not. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Our main outcome variables were physician acceptance of new patients with private noncapitated insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid. Our main independent variables were physician specialty and year groupings (2005-2006, 2007-2008, and 2009-2010). RESULTS: The percentage of psychiatrists who accepted private noncapitated insurance in 2009-2010 was significantly lower than the percentage of physicians in other specialties (55.3% [95% CI, 46.7%-63.8%] vs 88.7% [86.4%-90.7%]; P < .001) and had declined by 17.0% since 2005-2006. Similarly, the percentage of psychiatrists who accepted Medicare in 2009-2010 was significantly lower than that for other physicians (54.8% [95% CI, 46.6%-62.7%] vs 86.1% [84.4%-87.7%]; P < .001) and had declined by 19.5% since 2005-2006. Psychiatrists' Medicaid acceptance rates in 2009-2010 were also lower than those for other physicians (43.1% [95% CI, 34.9%-51.7%] vs 73.0% [70.3%-75.5%]; P < .001) but had not declined significantly from 2005-2006. Psychiatrists in the Midwest were more likely to accept private noncapitated insurance (85.1%) than those in the Northeast (48.5%), South (43.0%), or West (57.8%) (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Acceptance rates for all types of insurance were significantly lower for psychiatrists than for physicians in other specialties.

However, a lack of risk markers makes suicide risk assessment one of the most difficult areas of clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To assess psychotic symptoms (attenuated or frank) as a clinical marker of risk for suicide attempt. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study of 1112 school-based adolescents (aged 13-16 years), assessed at baseline and at 3 and 12 months for self-reported psychopathology, psychotic symptoms, and suicide attempts. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Suicide attempts at the 3- and 12-month follow-up and acute suicide attempts (defined as those occurring in the 2 weeks before an assessment). RESULTS: Of the total sample, 7% reported psychotic symptoms at baseline. Of that subsample, 7% reported a suicide attempt by the 3-month follow-up compared with 1% of the rest of the sample (odds ratio [OR], 10.01; 95% CI, 2.24-45.49), and 20% reported a suicide attempt by the 12-month follow-up compared with 2.5% of the rest of the sample (OR, 11.27; 95% CI, 4.44-28.62). Among adolescents with baseline psychopathology who reported psychotic symptoms, 14% reported a suicide attempt by 3 months (OR, 17.91; 95% CI, 3.61-88.82) and 34% reported a suicide attempt by 12 months (OR, 32.67; 95% CI, 10.42-102.41). Adolescents with psychopathology who reported psychotic symptoms had a nearly 70-fold increased odds of acute suicide attempts (OR, 67.50; 95% CI, 11.41-399.21). Differences were not explained by nonpsychotic psychiatric symptom burden, multimorbidity, or substance use. In a causative model, the population-attributable fraction of suicide attempts would be 56% to 75% for psychotic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adolescents with psychopathology who report psychotic symptoms are at clinical high risk for suicide attempts. More careful clinical assessment of psychotic symptoms (attenuated or frank) in mental health services and better understanding of their pathological significance are urgently needed.","Adolescent Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Ireland/epidemiology Male Prospective Studies Psychotic Disorders/*epidemiology Risk Assessment Risk Factors Suicide, Attempted/*prevention & control/*statistics & numerical data"
24920287,Pregnant women with posttraumatic stress disorder and risk of preterm birth.,JAMA Psychiatry,Yonkers KA and Smith MV and Forray A and Epperson CN and Costello D and Lin H and Belanger K,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in about 8% of pregnant women. Stressful conditions, including PTSD, are inconsistently linked to preterm birth. Psychotropic treatment has been frequently associated with preterm birth. Identifying whether the psychiatric illness or its treatment is independently associated with preterm birth may help clinicians and patients when making management decisions. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a likely diagnosis of PTSD or antidepressant and benzodiazepine treatment during pregnancy is associated with risk of preterm birth. We hypothesized that pregnant women who likely had PTSD and women receiving antidepressant or anxiolytic treatment would be more likely to experience preterm birth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal, prospective cohort study of 2654 women who were recruited before 17 completed weeks of pregnancy from 137 obstetrical practices in Connecticut and Western Massachusetts. EXPOSURES: Posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode, and use of antidepressant and benzodiazepine medications. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Preterm birth, operationalized as delivery prior to 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. Likely psychiatric diagnoses were generated through administration of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the Modified PTSD Symptom Scale. Data on medication use were gathered at each participant interview. RESULTS: Recursive partitioning analysis showed elevated rates of preterm birth among women with PTSD. A further split of the PTSD node showed high rates for women who met criteria for a major depressive episode, which suggests an interaction between these 2 exposures. Logistic regression analysis confirmed risk for women who likely had both conditions (odds ratio [OR], 4.08 [95% CI, 1.27-13.15]). For each point increase on the Modified PTSD Symptom Scale (range, 0-110), the risk of preterm birth increased by 1% to 2%. The odds of preterm birth are high for women who used a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (OR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.02-2.36]) and women who used a benzodiazepine medication (OR, 1.99 [95% CI, 0.98-4.03]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Women with likely diagnoses of both PTSD and a major depressive episode are at a 4-fold increased risk of preterm birth; this risk is greater than, and independent of, antidepressant and benzodiazepine use and is not simply a function of mood or anxiety symptoms.",Missing
24258147,The weight of traumatic stress: a prospective study of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and weight status in women.,JAMA Psychiatry,Kubzansky LD and Bordelois P and Jun HJ and Roberts AL and Cerda M and Bluestone N and Koenen KC,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) indicates a chronic stress reaction in response to trauma. This prevalent condition has been identified as a possible risk factor for obesity. Whether PTSD symptoms alter the trajectory of weight gain or constitute a comorbid condition has not been established. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether women who develop PTSD symptoms are subsequently more likely to gain weight and become obese relative to trauma-exposed women who do not develop PTSD symptoms or women with no trauma exposure or PTSD symptoms and whether the effects are independent of depression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Nurses' Health Study II, a prospective observational study initiated in 1989 with follow-up to 2005, using a PTSD screener to measure PTSD symptoms and time of onset. We included the subsample of the Nurses' Health Study II (54 224 participants; ages 24-44 years in 1989) in whom trauma and PTSD symptoms were measured. EXPOSURES: Trauma and PTSD symptoms. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Development of overweight and obesity using body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) cut points 25.0 and 30.0, respectively; change in BMI during follow-up among women reporting PTSD symptom onset before 1989; and BMI trajectory before and after PTSD symptom onset among women who developed PTSD symptoms in 1989 or during follow-up. RESULTS: Among women with at least 4 PTSD symptoms before 1989 (cohort initiation), BMI increased more steeply (b = 0.09 [SE = 0.01]; P < .001) during the follow-up. Among women who developed PTSD symptoms in 1989 or later, BMI trajectory did not differ by PTSD status before PTSD onset. After PTSD symptom onset, women with at least 4 symptoms had a faster rise in BMI (b = 0.08 [SE = 0.02]; P < .001). The onset of at least 4 PTSD symptoms in 1989 or later was also associated with an increased risk of becoming overweight or obese (odds ratio, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.19-1.56]) among women with a normal BMI in 1989. Effects were maintained after adjusting for depression. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Experience of PTSD symptoms is associated with an increased risk of becoming overweight or obese, and PTSD symptom onset alters BMI trajectories over time. The presence of PTSD symptoms should raise clinician concerns about physical health problems that may develop and prompt closer attention to weight status.","Adult Body Mass Index Female Humans Obesity/*etiology/psychology Overweight/etiology/psychology Prospective Studies Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Questionnaires Risk Factors Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*complications Weight Gain"
25230359,Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms and Food Addiction in Women by Timing and Type of Trauma Exposure.,JAMA Psychiatry,Mason SM and Flint AJ and Roberts AL and Agnew-Blais J and Koenen KC and Rich-Edwards JW,Missing,"Importance: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appears to increase obesity risk but the pathways by which PTSD leads to weight gain are not known. Identification of the links between PTSD and obesogenic eating behaviors is necessary to clarify this pathway and inform development of obesity prevention strategies in PTSD-affected populations. Objective: To determine whether women with PTSD symptoms are more likely to report food addiction, a measure of perceived dependence on food, than women without PTSD symptoms. Also, to determine whether age at PTSD symptom onset and type of trauma influence the PTSD-food addiction association. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional analysis of 49 408 participants in the Nurses' Health Study II, a cohort comprising women nurses who were aged 25 to 42 years at the 1989 recruitment from 14 US states. Main Outcomes and Measures: The Nurses' Health Study II ascertained lifetime trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms in 2008 and current food addiction in 2009. Food addiction was defined as 3 or more clinically significant symptoms on a modified version of the Yale Food Addiction Scale. Confounder-adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% CIs were estimated using modified Poisson regression. Results: Approximately 80% of the study sample reported some type of trauma exposure, with 66% of the trauma-exposed participants reporting at least 1 lifetime PTSD symptom. Eight percent of the cohort met the criteria for food addiction. The prevalence of food addiction increased with the number of lifetime PTSD symptoms, and women with the greatest number of PTSD symptoms (6-7 symptoms) had more than twice the prevalence of food addiction as women with neither PTSD symptoms nor trauma histories (prevalence ratio, 2.68; 95% CI, 2.41-2.97). Symptoms of PTSD were more strongly related to food addiction when symptom onset occurred at an earlier age. The PTSD-food addiction association did not differ substantially by trauma type.

24756513,Door-to-needle times for tissue plasminogen activator administration and clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke before and after a quality improvement initiative.,JAMA,Fonarow GC and Zhao X and Smith EE and Saver JL and Reeves MJ and Bhatt DL and Xian Y and Hernandez AF and Peterson ED and Schwamm LH,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The benefits of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) are time dependent and guidelines recommend a door-to-needle (DTN) time of 60 minutes or less. However, studies have found that less than 30% of US patients are treated within this time window. TARGET: Stroke was designed as a national quality improvement initiative to improve DTN times for tPA administration in patients with AIS. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate DTN times for tPA administration and the proportion of patients with times of 60 minutes or less before and after initiation of a quality improvement initiative and to determine whether potential improvements in DTN times were associated with improvements in clinical outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The TARGET: Stroke initiative disseminated 10 care strategies to achieve faster DTN times for tPA administration, provided clinical decision support tools, facilitated hospital participation, and encouraged sharing of best practices. This study included 71,169 patients with AIS treated with tPA (27,319 during the preintervention period from April 2003-December 2009 and 43,850 during the postintervention period from January 2010-September 2013) from 1030 Get With The Guidelines-Stroke participating hospitals (52.8% of total). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The DTN times for tPA administration of 60 minutes or less and in-hospital risk-adjusted mortality, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, ambulatory status at discharge, and discharge destination. RESULTS: Median DTN time for tPA administration declined from 77 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 60-98 minutes) during the preintervention period to 67 minutes (IQR, 51-87 minutes) during the postintervention period (P < .001). The DTN times for tPA administration of 60 minutes or less increased from 26.5% (95% CI, 26.0%-27.1%) of patients during the preintervention period to 41.3% (95% CI, 40.8%-41.7%) during the postintervention period (P < .001). The DTN times of 60 minutes or less increased from 29.6% (95% CI, 27.8%-31.5%) of patients in the quarter immediately before the intervention (fourth quarter of 2009) to 53.3% (95% CI, 51.5%-55.2%) in the final postintervention quarter (third quarter of 2013) (P < .001). The annual rate of improvement in DTN times of 60 minutes or less increased from 1.36% (95% CI, 1.04%-1.67%) per year preintervention to 6.20% (95% CI, 5.58%-6.78%) per year postintervention (P < .001). In-hospital all-cause mortality improved significantly from the preintervention to the postintervention period (9.93% vs 8.25%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.89 [95% CI, 0.83-0.94], P < .001), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours was less likely to occur (5.68% vs 4.68%; adjusted OR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.76-0.91], P < .001), and discharge to home was more frequent (37.6% vs 42.7%; adjusted OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.09-1.19], P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Implementation of a national quality improvement initiative was associated with improved timeliness of tPA administration following AIS on a national scale, and this improvement was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and intracranial hemorrhage, along with an increase in the percentage of patients discharged home.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Brain Ischemia/complications Decision Support Systems, Clinical Female Fibrinolytic Agents/*administration & dosage Guideline Adherence Hospital Mortality Hospitals Humans Intracranial Hemorrhages Male Middle Aged Patient Discharge *Quality Improvement Registries Stroke/*drug therapy/etiology Thrombolytic Therapy/standards Tissue Plasminogen Activator/*administration & dosage Treatment Outcome"

These changes may have affected various socioeconomic groups differentially. Objective: To investigate trends in dietary quality from 1999 to 2010 in the US adult population and within socioeconomic subgroups. Design, Setting, and Participants: Nationally representative sample of 29 124 adults aged 20 to 85 years from the US 1999 to 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Main Outcomes and Measures: The Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010), an 11-dimension score (range, 0-10 for each component score and 0-110 for the total score), was used to measure dietary quality. A higher AHEI-2010 score indicated a more healthful diet. Results: The energy-adjusted mean of the AHEI-2010 increased from 39.9 in 1999 to 2000 to 46.8 in 2009 to 2010 (linear trend P < .001). Reduction in trans fat intake accounted for more than half of this improvement. The AHEI-2010 component score increased by 0.9 points for sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice (reflecting decreased consumption), 0.7 points for whole fruit, 0.5 points for whole grains, 0.5 points for polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 0.4 points for nuts and legumes over the 12-year period (all linear trend P < .001). Family income and education level were positively associated with total AHEI-2010, and the gap between low and high socioeconomic status widened over time, from 3.9 points in 1999 to 2000 to 7.8 points in 2009 to 2010 (interaction P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance: Although a steady improvement in AHEI-2010 was observed across the 12-year period, the overall dietary quality remains poor. Better dietary quality was associated with higher socioeconomic status, and the gap widened with time. Future efforts to improve nutrition should address these disparities.",Missing
25073831,Racial disparities in adoption of axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy and lymphedema risk in women with breast cancer.,JAMA Surg,Black DM and Jiang J and Kuerer HM and Buchholz TA and Smith BD,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Racial disparities exist in many aspects of breast cancer care. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was developed to replace axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for staging early breast cancer to minimize complications. Racial disparities in the use of SLNB remain incompletely characterized, and their effect on lymphedema risk is not known. OBJECTIVE: To determine racial differences in SLNB use among patients with pathologically node-negative breast cancer during the period when SLNB became the preferred method for axillary staging as well as whether such differences affect lymphedema risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective study was conducted using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare-linked database from 2002 through 2007 to identify cases of incident, nonmetastatic, pathologically node-negative breast cancer in women aged 66 years or older. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sentinel lymph node biopsy use and 5-year cumulative incidence of lymphedema by race. RESULTS: Of 31 274 women identified, 1767 (5.6%) were black, 27 856 (89.1%) were white, and 1651 (5.3%) were of other or unknown race. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 73.7% of white patients and 62.4% of black patients (P < .001). The use of SLNB increased by year for both black and white patients (P < .001); however, a fixed disparity of approximately 12 percentage points in SLNB use persisted through 2007. In adjusted analysis, black patients were significantly less likely than white patients to undergo SLNB (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60-0.75; P < .001). Overall, the 5-year cumulative lymphedema risk was 8.2% in whites and 12.3% in blacks (hazard ratio [HR], 1.43; 95% CI, 1.23-1.67; P < .001). When stratified by type of axillary surgery, 5-year lymphedema risk was 6.8% in whites undergoing SLNB (HR, 1 [reference]), 8.8% in blacks undergoing SLNB (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.02-1.60; P = .03), 12.2% in whites undergoing ALND (1.79; 1.63-1.96; P < .001), and 18.0% in blacks undergoing ALND (2.76; 2.25-3.39; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although SLNB use increased in both black and white patients with pathologically node-negative breast cancer from 2002 through 2007, the rates of SLNB remained lower in black than white patients during this entire period by approximately 12 percentage points. This racial disparity in SLNB use contributed to racial disparities in lymphedema risk. Improvements in the dissemination of new techniques are needed to avoid disparities in breast cancer care and patient outcomes, particularly in disadvantaged groups.",Missing

However, concern remains about risks associated with their long-term use in older populations. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the use of PPIs and the risk of death or the combined end point of death or rehospitalization in older patients discharged from acute care hospitals. DESIGN: We investigated the relationship between PPI use and study outcomes using time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression in patients 65 years or older discharged from acute care medical wards from April 1 to June 30, 2007. SETTING: Eleven acute care medical wards. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred ninety-one patients (mean [SD] age, 80.0 [5.9] years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality and the combined end point of death or rehospitalization. RESULTS The use of PPIs was independently associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.03-2.77]) but not with the combined end point (1.49 [0.98-2.17]). An increased risk of mortality was observed among patients exposed to high-dose PPIs vs none (hazard ratio, 2.59 [95% CI, 1.22-7.16]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In older patients discharged from acute care hospitals, the use of high-dose PPIs is associated with increased 1-year mortality. Randomized controlled studies including older frail patients are needed. In the meantime, physicians need to use caution and balance benefits and harms in long-term prescription of high-dose PPIs.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Female Humans Male *Mortality *Patient Readmission Proportional Hazards Models Proton Pump Inhibitors/*adverse effects Risk Time Factors"

OBJECTIVE: To examine long-term trends in the prevalence and incidence of diagnosed diabetes to determine whether there have been periods of acceleration or deceleration in rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed 1980-2012 data for 664,969 adults aged 20 to 79 years from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to estimate incidence and prevalence rates for the overall civilian, noninstitutionalized, US population and by demographic subgroups (age group, sex, race/ethnicity, and educational level). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The annual percentage change (APC) in rates of the prevalence and incidence of diagnosed diabetes (type 1 and type 2 combined). RESULTS: The APC for age-adjusted prevalence and incidence of diagnosed diabetes did not change significantly during the 1980s (for prevalence, 0.2% [95% CI, -0.9% to 1.4%], P = .69; for incidence, -0.1% [95% CI, -2.5% to 2.4%], P = .93), but each increased sharply during 1990-2008 (for prevalence, 4.5% [95% CI, 4.1% to 4.9%], P < .001; for incidence, 4.7% [95% CI, 3.8% to 5.6%], P < .001) before leveling off with no significant change during 2008-2012 (for prevalence, 0.6% [95% CI, -1.9% to 3.0%], P = .64; for incidence, -5.4% [95% CI, -11.3% to 0.9%], P = .09). The prevalence per 100 persons was 3.5 (95% CI, 3.2 to 3.9) in 1990, 7.9 (95% CI, 7.4 to 8.3) in 2008, and 8.3 (95% CI, 7.9 to 8.7) in 2012. The incidence per 1000 persons was 3.2 (95% CI, 2.2 to 4.1) in 1990, 8.8 (95% CI, 7.4 to 10.3) in 2008, and 7.1 (95% CI, 6.1 to 8.2) in 2012. Trends in many demographic subpopulations were similar to these overall trends. However, incidence rates among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adults continued to increase (for interaction, P = .03 for non-Hispanic black adults and P = .01 for Hispanic adults) at rates significantly greater than for non-Hispanic white adults. In addition, the rate of increase in prevalence was higher for adults who had a high school education or less compared with those who had more than a high school education (for interaction, P = .006 for <high school and P < .001 for high school). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Analyses of nationally representative data from 1980 to 2012 suggest a doubling of the incidence and prevalence of diabetes during 1990-2008, and a plateauing between 2008 and 2012. However, there appear to be continued increases in the prevalence or incidence of diabetes among subgroups, including non-Hispanic black and Hispanic subpopulations and those with a high school education or less.",Missing
23986338,The experience of symptoms of depression in men vs women: analysis of the National Comorbidity Survey Replication.,JAMA Psychiatry,Martin LA and Neighbors HW and Griffith DM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: When men are depressed they may experience symptoms that are different than what is included in the current diagnostic criteria. OBJECTIVE: To explore whether sex disparities in depression rates disappear when alternative symptoms are considered in the place of, or in addition to, more conventional depression symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Using data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, a nationally represented mental health survey, we evaluated sex differences in symptom endorsement in 2 new scales that included alternative depression symptoms. We analyzed sex differences in symptom endorsement using 2-sided, design-based, .05-level t tests and multivariate logistic regression to identify predictors of depression. RESULTS; Men reported higher rates of anger attacks/aggression, substance abuse, and risk taking compared with women. Analyses using the scale that included alternative, male-type symptoms of depression found that a higher proportion of men (26.3%) than women (21.9%) (P = .007) met criteria for depression. Analyses using the scale that included alternative and traditional depression symptoms found that men and women met criteria for depression in equal proportions: 30.6% of men and 33.3% of women (P = .57).

OBJECTIVE: To compare regional cardiovascular procedure rates between Medicare Advantage and Medicare FFS beneficiaries. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of Medicare beneficiaries older than 65 years between 2003-2007 comparing rates of coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery across 32 hospital referral regions in 12 states. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of coronary angiography, PCI, and CABG surgery. RESULTS: We evaluated a total of 878,339 Medicare Advantage patients and 5,013,650 Medicare FFS patients. Compared with Medicare FFS patients, Medicare Advantage patients had lower age-, sex-, race-, and income-adjusted procedure rates per 1000 person-years for angiography (16.5 [95% CI, 14.8-18.2] vs 25.9 [95% CI, 24.0-27.9]; P < .001) and PCI (6.8 [95% CI, 6.0-7.6] vs 9.8 [95% CI, 9.0-10.6]; P < .001) but similar rates for CABG surgery (3.1 [95% CI, 2.8-3.5] vs 3.4 [95% CI, 3.1-3.7]; P = .33). There were no significant differences between Medicare Advantage and Medicare FFS patients in the rates per 1000 person-years of urgent angiography (3.9 [95% CI, 3.6-4.2] vs 4.3 [95% CI, 4.0-4.6]; P = .24) or PCI (2.4 [95% CI, 2.2-2.7] vs 2.7 [95% CI, 2.5-2.9]; P = .16). Procedure rates varied widely across hospital referral regions among Medicare Advantage and Medicare FFS patients. For angiography, the rates per 1000 person-years ranged from 9.8 to 40.6 for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries and from 15.7 to 44.3 for Medicare FFS beneficiaries. For PCI, the rates ranged from 3.5 to 16.8 for Medicare Advantage and from 4.7 to 16.1 for Medicare FFS. The rates for CABG surgery ranged from 1.5 to 6.1 for Medicare Advantage and from 2.5 to 6.0 for Medicare FFS. Across regions, we found no statistically significant correlation between Medicare Advantage and Medicare FFS beneficiary utilization for angiography (Spearman r = 0.19, P = .29) and modest correlations for PCI (Spearman r = 0.33, P = .06) and CABG surgery (Spearman r = 0.35, P = .05). Among Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, adjustment for additional cardiac risk factors had little influence on procedure rates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in capitated Medicare Advantage programs had lower angiography and PCI procedure rates than those enrolled in Medicare FFS, the degree of geographic variation in procedure rates was substantial among Medicare Advantage beneficiaries and was similar in magnitude to that observed among Medicare FFS beneficiaries.","Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Capitation Fee Coronary Angiography/*utilization Coronary Artery Bypass/*utilization Cross-Sectional Studies Fee-for-Service Plans/*statistics & numerical data Female Geography Humans Male Medicare/*statistics & numerical data Medicare Part C/*statistics & numerical data Percutaneous Coronary Intervention/*utilization Reimbursement, Incentive Sex Factors United States"

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether public reporting for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with lower rates of PCI for patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) or with higher mortality rates in this population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective observational study conducted using data from fee-for-service Medicare patients (49,660 from reporting states and 48,142 from nonreporting states) admitted with acute MI to US acute care hospitals between 2002 and 2010. Logistic regression was used to compare PCI and mortality rates between reporting states (New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania) and regional nonreporting states (Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland, and Delaware). Changes in PCI rates over time in Massachusetts compared with nonreporting states were also examined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk-adjusted PCI and mortality rates. RESULTS: In 2010, patients with acute MI were less likely to receive PCI in public reporting states than in nonreporting states (unadjusted rates, 37.7% vs 42.7%, respectively; risk-adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.82 [95% CI, 0.71-0.93]; P = .003). Differences were greatest among the 6708 patients with ST-segment elevation MI (61.8% vs 68.0%; OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.59-0.89]; P = .002) and the 2194 patients with cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest (41.5% vs 46.7%; OR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.64-0.98]; P = .03). There were no differences in overall mortality among patients with acute MI in reporting vs nonreporting states. In Massachusetts, odds of PCI for acute MI were comparable with odds in nonreporting states prior to public reporting (40.6% vs 41.8%; OR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.71-1.41]). However, after implementation of public reporting, odds of undergoing PCI in Massachusetts decreased compared with nonreporting states (41.1% vs 45.6%; OR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.47-1.38]; P = .03 for difference in differences). Differences were most pronounced for the 6081 patients with cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest (prereporting: 44.2% vs 36.6%; OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 0.85-2.32]; postreporting: 43.9% vs 44.8%; OR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.38-2.22]; P = .03 for difference in differences). CONCLUSIONS: Among Medicare beneficiaries with acute MI, the use of PCI was lower for patients treated in 3 states with public reporting of PCI outcomes compared with patients treated in 7 regional control states without public reporting. However, there was no difference in overall acute MI mortality between states with and without public reporting.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Angioplasty/standards/*utilization Fee-for-Service Plans/statistics & numerical data Female Hospitals/statistics & numerical data Humans Male *Mandatory Reporting Medicare/*statistics & numerical data Myocardial Infarction/*mortality/*therapy Quality Assurance, Health Care Risk Assessment Treatment Outcome United States/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVES: To identify published reanalyses of RCT data, to characterize methodological and other differences between the original trial and reanalysis, to evaluate the independence of authors performing the reanalyses, and to assess whether the reanalysis changed interpretations from the original article about the types or numbers of patients who should be treated. DESIGN: We completed an electronic search of MEDLINE from inception to March 9, 2014, to identify all published studies that completed a reanalysis of individual patient data from previously published RCTs addressing the same hypothesis as the original RCT. Four data extractors independently screened articles and extracted data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in direction and magnitude of treatment effect, statistical significance, and interpretation about the types or numbers of patients who should be treated. RESULTS: We identified 37 eligible reanalyses in 36 published articles, 5 of which were performed by entirely independent authors (2 based on publicly available data and 2 on data that were provided on request; data availability was unclear for 1). Reanalyses differed most commonly in statistical or analytical approaches (n = 18) and in definitions or measurements of the outcome of interest (n = 12). Four reanalyses changed the direction and 2 changed the magnitude of treatment effect, whereas 4 led to changes in statistical significance of findings. Thirteen reanalyses (35%) led to interpretations different from that of the original article, 3 (8%) showing that different patients should be treated; 1 (3%), that fewer patients should be treated; and 9 (24%), that more patients should be treated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A small number of reanalyses of RCTs have been published to date. Only a few were conducted by entirely independent authors.

Such nonspecific effects of vaccines might also be important for the health of children in high-income settings. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the live vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) is associated with lower rates of hospital admissions for infections among children in Denmark. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study of Danish children born 1997-2006 and followed up from ages 11 months to 2 years (last follow-up, August 31, 2008). Nationwide Danish registers provided data on vaccinations and hospital admissions. The recommended vaccination schedule was inactivated vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTaP-IPV-Hib) administered at ages 3, 5, and 12 months and MMR at age 15 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of hospital admissions for any infection, comparing receipt of MMR vs DTaP-IPV-Hib as the most recent vaccine. Risks, risk difference, and number needed to vaccinate were calculated for receiving MMR on time. RESULTS: The study included 495,987 children contributing with 56,889 hospital admissions for any type of infection during 509,427 person-years (rate, 11.2 per 100 person-years). For the 456,043 children who followed the recommended schedule and received MMR after the third dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib, MMR (rate, 8.9 per 100 person-years) vs the third dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib (rate, 12.4 per 100 person-years) as the most recent vaccine was associated with an adjusted IRR of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.84-0.88) for any admission for infection. There were 19,219 children immunized out of sequence. The adjusted IRR was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.80-0.95) for those receiving MMR (rate, 9.9 per 100 person-years) after the second dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib (rate, 15.1 per 100 person-years). However, in the 1981 children who subsequently received the third dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib (rate, 12.8 per 100 person-years) after MMR, the IRR for hospital admissions for infection was significantly greater (adjusted IRR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.28-2.05]). The risk of admission for an infection between ages 16 months and 24 months was 4.6% (95% CI, 4.5%-4.7%) for receiving MMR on time and 5.1% (95% CI, 5.0%-5.2%) for not receiving MMR on time. The risk difference was 0.5 percentage point (95% CI, 0.4-0.6), and the number needed to vaccinate with MMR before age 16 months to prevent 1 admission for any infection was 201 (95% CI, 159-272). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a cohort of Danish children, receipt of live MMR vs inactivated DTaP-IPV-Hib as the most recent vaccine was associated with a lower rate of hospital admissions for any infections. These findings require replication in other high-income populations.","Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Denmark/epidemiology Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis Vaccines/administration & dosage Female Haemophilus Vaccines/administration & dosage Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data Humans Incidence Infant Infection/*epidemiology Male Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine/*administration & dosage Poliovirus Vaccines/administration & dosage Registries/statistics & numerical data Risk Socioeconomic Factors Vaccines, Attenuated/administration & dosage"

Injection site reactions after Tdap immunization were reported in 26 (78.8% [95% CI, 61.1%-91.0%]) and 12 (80% [95% CI, 51.9%-95.7%]) pregnant and postpartum women, respectively (P > .99). Systemic symptoms were reported in 12 (36.4% [ 95% CI, 20.4%-54.9%]) and 11 (73.3% [95% CI, 44.9%-92.2%]) pregnant and postpartum women, respectively (P = .03). Growth and development were similar in both infant groups. No cases of pertussis occurred. Significantly higher concentrations of pertussis antibodies were measured at delivery in women who received Tdap during pregnancy vs postpartum (eg, pertussis toxin antibodies: 51.0 EU/mL [95% CI, 37.1-70.1] and 9.1 EU/mL [95% CI, 4.6-17.8], respectively; P < .001) and in their infants at birth (68.8 EU/mL [95% CI, 52.1-90.8] and 14.0 EU/mL [95% CI, 7.3-26.9], respectively; P < .001) and at age 2 months (20.6 EU/mL [95% CI, 14.4-29.6] and 5.3 EU/mL [95% CI, 3.0-9.4], respectively; P < .001). Antibody responses in infants born to women receiving Tdap during pregnancy were not different following the fourth dose of DTaP. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This preliminary assessment did not find an increased risk of adverse events among women who received Tdap vaccine during pregnancy or their infants. For secondary outcomes, maternal immunization with Tdap resulted in high concentrations of pertussis antibodies in infants during the first 2 months of life and did not substantially alter infant responses to DTaP. Further research is needed to provide definitive evidence of the safety and efficacy of Tdap immunization during pregnancy.

23959427,Recurrence of autism spectrum disorders in full- and half-siblings and trends over time: a population-based cohort study.,JAMA Pediatr,Gronborg TK and Schendel DE and Parner ET,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: To date, this is the first population-based study to examine the recurrence risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), including time trends, and the first study to consider the ASDs recurrence risk for full- and half-siblings. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the relative recurrence risk for ASDs in a Danish population, including recurrence in full- and half-siblings, and to examine time trends in ASDs relative to the recurrence risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study in Denmark. All children (about 1.5 million) born in Denmark between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2004, were identified and followed up to December 31, 2010. We identified a maternal sibling subcohort derived from mothers with at least 2 children and a paternal sibling subcohort derived from fathers with at least 2 children. EXPOSURES: Children having an older sibling with ASDs are compared with children not having an older sibling with ASDs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The adjusted hazard ratio for ASDs among children having an older sibling with ASDs compared with children not having an older sibling with ASDs. RESULTS The overall relative recurrence risk for ASDs was 6.9 (95% CI, 6.1-7.8), and it did not change significantly over time; similar risks were observed in maternal and paternal full-siblings. The relative recurrence risks were 2.4 (95% CI, 1.4-4.1) for maternal half-siblings and 1.5 (95% CI, 0.7-3.4) for paternal half-siblings. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our population-based recurrence risk estimate is lower than the recently reported estimates from clinical samples. Our results demonstrate no time trend in the ASDs recurrence risk as seen in the ASDs prevalence. The difference in the recurrence risk between full- and half-siblings supports the role of genetics in ASDs, while the significant recurrence risk in maternal half-siblings may support the role of factors associated with pregnancy and the maternal intrauterine environment in ASDs.","Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/*epidemiology/etiology/genetics Cohort Studies Denmark/epidemiology Female Humans Male Prevalence Proportional Hazards Models Recurrence Registries Risk *Siblings"

How these alterations and hippocampal subfields might differ across the psychosis spectrum remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To characterize medial temporal lobe structures, including hippocampal subfields, using magnetic resonance imaging and to examine their relation to psychosis and cognitive function across the psychosis spectrum. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case-control, cross-sectional neuroimaging study in a large series of probands with psychotic disorders and healthy volunteers as part of the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP). Patients with psychotic disorders (schizophrenia, n = 219; schizoaffective disorder, n = 142; and psychotic bipolar disorder, n = 188) and healthy controls (n = 337) were recruited across ambulatory clinics at university health centers in the B-SNIP consortium. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Medial temporal lobe and hippocampal subfields were quantified with an automated parcellation approach using FreeSurfer software. Memory and other cognitive parameters were assessed using standardized neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: Hippocampal volume reductions were seen in all 3 diagnostic groups when compared with healthy controls; alterations in the entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal regions were limited to schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders (P < .001). Smaller volumes across the hippocampal subfields were seen in all 3 psychotic disorders, with the most prominent differences being in cornu ammonis 2/3 (P < .001). Hippocampal volumes were positively correlated with psychosis severity, declarative memory, and overall cognitive performance (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Alterations in the hippocampus were evident across psychotic disorders. Hippocampal subfields that participate in memory-related processes supporting pattern separation and pattern completion might be abnormal and may underlie the pathophysiology of psychosis.",Adolescent Adult Aged Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*pathology/physiopathology Case-Control Studies Cross-Sectional Studies *Endophenotypes Female Hippocampus/*pathology/physiopathology Humans Male Middle Aged Psychotic Disorders/diagnosis/*pathology/physiopathology Schizophrenia/diagnosis/*pathology/physiopathology Severity of Illness Index Temporal Lobe/*pathology/physiopathology Young Adult

23483176,Association of smoking cessation and weight change with cardiovascular disease among adults with and without diabetes.,JAMA,Clair C and Rigotti NA and Porneala B and Fox CS and D'Agostino RB and Pencina MJ and Meigs JB,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Smoking cessation reduces the risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but weight gain that follows quitting smoking may weaken the CVD benefit of quitting. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that weight gain following smoking cessation does not attenuate the benefits of smoking cessation among adults with and without diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective community-based cohort study using data from the Framingham Offspring Study collected from 1984 through 2011. At each 4-year examination, self-reported smoking status was assessed and categorized as smoker, recent quitter (</= 4 years), long-term quitter (>4 years), and nonsmoker. Pooled Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association between quitting smoking and 6-year CVD events and to test whether 4-year change in weight following smoking cessation modified the association between smoking cessation and CVD events. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence over 6 years of total CVD events, comprising coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular events, peripheral artery disease, and congestive heart failure. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 25 (SD, 9.6) years, 631 CVD events occurred among 3251 participants. Median 4-year weight gain was greater for recent quitters without diabetes (2.7 kg [interquartile range {IQR}, -0.5 to 6.4]) and with diabetes (3.6 kg [IQR, -1.4 to 8.2]) than for long-term quitters (0.9 kg [IQR, -1.4 to 3.2] and 0.0 kg [IQR, -3.2 to 3.2], respectively, P < .001). Among participants without diabetes, age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate of CVD was 5.9 per 100 person-examinations (95% CI, 4.9-7.1) in smokers, 3.2 per 100 person-examinations (95% CI, 2.1-4.5) in recent quitters, 3.1 per 100 person-examinations (95% CI, 2.6-3.7) in long-term quitters, and 2.4 per 100 person-examinations (95% CI, 2.0-3.0) in nonsmokers. After adjustment for CVD risk factors, compared with smokers, recent quitters had a hazard ratio (HR) for CVD of 0.47 (95% CI, 0.23-0.94) and long-term quitters had an HR of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.34-0.63); these associations had only a minimal change after further adjustment for weight change. Among participants with diabetes, there were similar point estimates that did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this community-based cohort, smoking cessation was associated with a lower risk of CVD events among participants without diabetes, and weight gain that occurred following smoking cessation did not modify this association. This supports a net cardiovascular benefit of smoking cessation, despite subsequent weight gain.",Adult Aged Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology Diabetes Mellitus/*epidemiology Female Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Prevalence Prospective Studies Risk Factors *Smoking Cessation United States/epidemiology *Weight Gain

Although they can be effectively treated in the short term, data are limited on the long-term outcomes in treated children and adolescents, particularly those treated with medication. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether acute clinical improvement and treatment type (i.e., cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, or their combination) predicted remission of anxiety and improvement in global functioning at a mean of 6 years after randomization and to examine predictors of outcomes at follow-up. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This naturalistic follow-up study, as part of the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Extended Long-term Study (CAMELS), was conducted at 6 academic sites in the United States and included 288 youths (age range, 11-26 years; mean age, 17 years). Youths were randomized to 1 of 4 interventions (cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, combination, or pill placebo) in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS) and were evaluated a mean of 6 years after randomization. Participants in this study constituted 59.0% of the original CAMS sample. EXPOSURES: Participants were assessed by independent evaluators using a semistructured diagnostic interview to determine the presence of anxiety disorders, the severity of anxiety, and global functioning. Participants and their parents completed questionnaires about mental health symptoms, family functioning, life events, and mental health service use. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Remission, defined as the absence of all study entry anxiety disorders. RESULTS Almost half of the sample (46.5%) were in remission a mean of 6 years after randomization. Responders to acute treatment were significantly more likely to be in remission (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.08-3.09) and had less severe anxiety symptoms and higher functioning; the assigned treatment arm was unrelated to outcomes. Several predictors of remission and functioning were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Youths rated as responders during the acute treatment phase of CAMS were more likely to be in remission a mean of 6 years after randomization, although the effect size was small. Relapse occurred in almost half (48%) of acute responders, suggesting the need for more intensive or continued treatment for a sizable proportion of youths with anxiety disorders.

Many stones migrate spontaneously into the duodenum, making preoperative common duct investigations unnecessary. OBJECTIVE: To compare strategies of cholecystectomy first vs a sequential endoscopic common duct assessment and cholecystectomy for the management of patients with an intermediate risk of a common duct stone. The main objective was to reduce the length of stay and the secondary objectives were to reduce the number of common duct investigations, morbidity, and costs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Interventional, randomized clinical trial with 2 parallel groups performed between June 2011 and February 2013, with a patient follow-up of 6 months. The trial comprised a random sample of 100 adult patients admitted to Geneva University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland, for acute gallstone-related conditions with an intermediate risk of a common duct stone. Fifty patients were randomized to each group. INTERVENTIONS: Cholecystectomy first with intraoperative cholangiogram for the study group and endoscopic common duct assessment and clearance followed by cholecystectomy for the control group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Length of initial hospital stay (primary end point), number of common duct investigations and morbidity and mortality within 6 months after initial admission, and quality of life at 1 and 6 months after discharge (EQ-5D-5L [EuroQol Group, 5-level] questionnaire). RESULTS: Patients who underwent cholecystectomy as a first step had a significantly shorter length of hospital stay (median, 5 days [interquartile range {IQR}, 1-8] vs median, 8 days [IQR, 6-12]; P < .001), with fewer common duct investigations (25 vs 71; P < .001), no significant difference in morbidity or quality of life. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients at intermediate risk of a common duct stone, initial cholecystectomy compared with sequential common duct endoscopy assessment and subsequent surgery resulted in a shorter length of stay without increased morbidity. If these findings are confirmed, initial cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram may be a preferred approach.

OBJECTIVE: To examine postdiagnostic fat intake in relation to lethal prostate cancer and all-cause mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study of 4577 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2010). EXPOSURES: Postdiagnostic intake of saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, trans, animal, and vegetable fat. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lethal prostate cancer (distant metastases or prostate cancer-specific death) and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: We observed 315 events of lethal prostate cancer and 1064 deaths (median follow-up, 8.4 years). Crude rates per 1000 person-years for lethal prostate cancer were as follows (highest vs lowest quintile of fat intake): 7.6 vs 7.3 for saturated, 6.4 vs 7.2 for monounsaturated, 5.8 vs 8.2 for polyunsaturated, 8.7 vs 6.1 for trans, 8.3 vs 5.7 for animal, and 4.7 vs 8.7 for vegetable fat. For all-cause mortality, the rates were 28.4 vs 21.4 for saturated, 20.0 vs 23.7 for monounsaturated, 17.1 vs 29.4 for polyunsaturated, 32.4 vs 17.1 for trans, 32.0 vs 17.2 for animal, and 15.4 vs 32.7 for vegetable fat. Replacing 10% of energy intake from carbohydrate with vegetable fat was associated with a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51-0.98; P = .04) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61-0.88; P = .001). No other fats were associated with lethal prostate cancer. Saturated and trans fats after diagnosis (replacing 5% and 1% of energy from carbohydrate, respectively) were associated with higher all-cause mortality (HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.05-1.60; P = .02] and 1.25 [95% CI, 1.05-1.49; P = .01], respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer, replacing carbohydrates and animal fat with vegetable fat may reduce the risk of all-cause mortality.

In cases of laser removal of tattoos, hidden suspicious nevi may be revealed gradually. OBSERVATIONS: We describe the first case of a malignant melanoma that developed on a preexisting nevus within a tattoo during and between the phases of laser removal. The patient refused to undergo excision of the nevus until we made excision conditional for continued laser treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The English literature reports 16 cases of malignant melanoma developing in tattoos. Correlation between the placement of tattoos and the development of malignant melanoma remains unclear. Our case emphasizes the diagnostic problems of pigmented lesions within tattoos. For safety reasons, tattoos should never be placed on pigmented lesions; if they are, the tattoos should not undergo laser treatment. We suggest an excision before starting laser tattoo removal. Dermoscopic assessments on a regular basis during the period of tattoo removal are recommended.","Adult Dermoscopy/methods Humans Lasers, Solid-State/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Male Melanoma/*diagnosis/pathology/surgery Nevus, Pigmented/*diagnosis/pathology/surgery Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/surgery *Tattooing"

In February 2013, a kidney recipient with no reported exposures to potentially rabid animals died from rabies 18 months after transplantation. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether organ transplantation was the source of rabies virus exposure in the kidney recipient, and to evaluate for and prevent rabies in other transplant recipients from the same donor. DESIGN: Organ donor and all transplant recipient medical records were reviewed. Laboratory tests to detect rabies virus-specific binding antibodies, rabies virus neutralizing antibodies, and rabies virus antigens were conducted on available specimens, including serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissues from the donor and the recipients. Viral ribonucleic acid was extracted from tissues and amplified for nucleoprotein gene sequencing for phylogenetic comparisons. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Determination of whether the donor died from undiagnosed rabies and whether other organ recipients developed rabies. RESULTS: In retrospect, the donor's clinical presentation (which began with vomiting and upper extremity paresthesias and progressed to fever, seizures, dysphagia, autonomic dysfunction, and brain death) was consistent with rabies. Rabies virus antigen was detected in archived autopsy brain tissue collected from the donor. The rabies viruses infecting the donor and the deceased kidney recipient were consistent with the raccoon rabies virus variant and were more than 99.9% identical across the entire N gene (1349/1350 nucleotides), thus confirming organ transplantation as the route of transmission. The 3 other organ recipients remained asymptomatic, with rabies virus neutralizing antibodies detected in their serum after completion of postexposure prophylaxis (range, 0.3-40.8 IU/mL). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Unlike the 2 previous clusters of rabies virus transmission through solid organ transplantation, there was a long incubation period in the recipient who developed rabies, and survival of 3 other recipients without pretransplant rabies vaccination. Rabies should be considered in patients with acute progressive encephalitis of unexplained etiology, especially for potential organ donors. A standard evaluation of potential donors who meet screening criteria for infectious encephalitis should be considered, and risks and benefits for recipients of organs from these donors should be evaluated.",Animals Humans *Infectious Disease Incubation Period Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects Male Polymerase Chain Reaction Rabies/diagnosis/physiopathology/prevention & control/*transmission Rabies Vaccines/therapeutic use Rabies virus/*genetics/isolation & purification Raccoons/virology Retrospective Studies *Tissue Donors

This is particularly germane to neurologists because better recognition of the clinical characteristics of patients with fungal meningitis and ischemic stroke will provide more timely and efficient care. OBSERVATIONS: In a case series, 3 patients presented to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, with acute ischemic stroke and later received a diagnosis of fungal meningitis attributed to epidural injections of contaminated methylprednisolone. Of these 3 patients, 2 were women, and the mean age for all 3 was 75.3 years. Their medical records and imaging scans were reviewed. All 3 patients presented with acute ischemic strokes and had a history of epidural spinal injections of methylprednisolone for low back pain. All 3 patients had 1 or more traditional risk factors for stroke. There were differing vascular patterns of presentation: 2 patients presented with small-vessel (lacunar) infarctions, whereas 1 patient presented with a large-vessel infarct. Of these 3 patients, 2 died and underwent an autopsy, which revealed Exserohilum rostratum as the presumed cause of death. For 2 cases, fever and meningeal signs were absent at presentation.

23212501,Association between a medical school admission process using the multiple mini-interview and national licensing examination scores.,JAMA,Eva KW and Reiter HI and Rosenfeld J and Trinh K and Wood TJ and Norman GR,Missing,"CONTEXT: There has been difficulty designing medical school admissions processes that provide valid measurement of candidates' nonacademic qualities. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether students deemed acceptable through a revised admissions protocol using a 12-station multiple mini-interview (MMI) outperform others on the 2 parts of the Canadian national licensing examinations (Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination [MCCQE]). The MMI process requires candidates to rotate through brief sequential interviews with structured tasks and independent assessment within each interview. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort study comparing potential medical students who were interviewed at McMaster University using an MMI in 2004 or 2005 and accepted (whether or not they matriculated at McMaster) with those who were interviewed and rejected but gained entry elsewhere. The computer-based MCCQE part I (aimed at assessing medical knowledge and clinical decision making) can be taken on graduation from medical school; MCCQE part II (involving simulated patient interactions testing various aspects of practice) is based on the objective structured clinical examination and typically completed 16 months into postgraduate training. Interviews were granted to 1071 candidates, and those who gained entry could feasibly complete both parts of their licensure examination between May 2007 and March 2011. Scores could be matched on the examinations for 751 (part I) and 623 (part II) interviewees. INTERVENTION: Admissions decisions were made by combining z score transformations of scores assigned to autobiographical essays, grade point average, and MMI performance. Academic and nonacademic measures contributed equally to the final ranking. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Scores on MCCQE part I (standardized cut-score, 390 [SD, 100]) and part II (standardized mean, 500 [SD, 100]). RESULTS: Candidates accepted by the admissions process had higher scores than those who were rejected for part I (mean total score, 531 [95% CI, 524-537] vs 515 [95% CI, 507-522]; P = .003) and for part II (mean total score, 563 [95% CI, 556-570] vs 544 [95% CI, 534-554]; P = .007). Among the accepted group, those who matriculated at McMaster did not outperform those who matriculated elsewhere for part I (mean total score, 524 [95% CI, 515-533] vs 546 [95% CI, 535-557]; P = .004) and for part II (mean total score, 557 [95% CI, 548-566] vs 582 [95% CI, 569-594]; P = .003).

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between BRAF V600E mutation and PTC-related mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective study of 1849 patients (1411 women and 438 men) with a median age of 46 years (interquartile range, 34-58 years) and an overall median follow-up time of 33 months (interquartile range, 13-67 months) after initial treatment at 13 centers in 7 countries between 1978 and 2011. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient deaths specifically caused by PTC. RESULTS: Overall, mortality was 5.3% (45/845; 95% CI, 3.9%-7.1%) vs 1.1% (11/1004; 95% CI, 0.5%-2.0%) (P < .001) in BRAF V600E-positive vs mutation-negative patients. Deaths per 1000 person-years in the analysis of all PTC were 12.87 (95% CI, 9.61-17.24) vs 2.52 (95% CI, 1.40-4.55) in BRAF V600E-positive vs mutation-negative patients; the hazard ratio (HR) was 2.66 (95% CI, 1.30-5.43) after adjustment for age at diagnosis, sex, and medical center. Deaths per 1000 person-years in the analysis of the conventional variant of PTC were 11.80 (95% CI, 8.39-16.60) vs 2.25 (95% CI, 1.01-5.00) in BRAF V600E-positive vs mutation-negative patients; the adjusted HR was 3.53 (95% CI, 1.25-9.98). When lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal invasion, and distant metastasis were also included in the model, the association of BRAF V600E with mortality for all PTC was no longer significant (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.53-2.76). A higher BRAF V600E-associated patient mortality was also observed in several clinicopathological subcategories, but statistical significance was lost with adjustment for patient age, sex, and medical center. For example, in patients with lymph node metastasis, the deaths per 1000 person-years were 26.26 (95% CI, 19.18-35.94) vs 5.93 (95% CI, 2.96-11.86) in BRAF V600E-positive vs mutation-negative patients (unadjusted HR, 4.43 [95% CI, 2.06-9.51]; adjusted HR, 1.46 [95% CI, 0.62-3.47]). In patients with distant tumor metastasis, deaths per 1000 person-years were 87.72 (95% CI, 62.68-122.77) vs 32.28 (95% CI, 16.14-64.55) in BRAF V600E-positive vs mutation-negative patients (unadjusted HR, 2.63 [95% CI, 1.21-5.72]; adjusted HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.27-2.62]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this retrospective multicenter study, the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation was significantly associated with increased cancer-related mortality among patients with PTC. Because overall mortality in PTC is low and the association was not independent of tumor features, how to use BRAF V600E to manage mortality risk in patients with PTC is unclear. These findings support further investigation of the prognostic and therapeutic implications of BRAF V600E status in PTC.",Adult Aged Carcinoma/*genetics/*mortality/pathology *DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Lymphatic Metastasis Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics Retrospective Studies Risk Thyroid Neoplasms/*genetics/*mortality/pathology
23925593,Conflicts of interest in approvals of additives to food determined to be generally recognized as safe: out of balance.,JAMA Intern Med,Neltner TG and Alger HM and O'Reilly JT and Krimsky S and Bero LA and Maffini MV,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance allows food manufacturers to determine whether additives to food are ""generally recognized as safe"" (GRAS). Manufacturers are not required to notify the FDA of a GRAS determination, although in some instances they notify the agency. The individuals that companies select to make these determinations may have financial conflicts of interest. OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which individuals selected by manufacturers to make GRAS determinations have conflicts of interest between their obligations to ensure that the use of the additive is safe and their financial relationships to the company. DESIGN Using conflict of interest criteria developed by a committee of the Institute of Medicine, we analyzed 451 GRAS notifications that were voluntarily submitted to the FDA between 1997 and 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number of GRAS notices submitted to the FDA; frequency of various types of relationships between decision maker and additive manufacturer; frequency of participation on GRAS panels by individuals; and number of GRAS safety determinations identified by the FDA that were not submitted to the agency. RESULTS: For the 451 GRAS notifications, 22.4% of the safety assessments were made by an employee of an additive manufacturer, 13.3% by an employee of a consulting firm selected by the manufacturer, and 64.3% by an expert panel selected by either a consulting firm or the manufacturer. A standing expert panel selected by a third party made none of these safety assessments. The 290 panels that made GRAS determinations had an average of 3.5 members, with a maximum of 7. Ten individuals served on 27 or more panels; 1 individual served on 128 panels (44.1%). At least 1 of the 10 individuals with the most frequent service was a member of 225 panels (77.6%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Between 1997 and 2012, financial conflicts of interest were ubiquitous in determinations that an additive to food was GRAS. The lack of independent review in GRAS determinations raises concerns about the integrity of the process and whether it ensures the safety of the food supply, particularly in instances where the manufacturer does not notify the FDA of the determination. The FDA should address these concerns.","Chemical Industry/*ethics *Conflict of Interest Food Additives/*adverse effects/analysis Food Industry/*ethics Humans Interinstitutional Relations *Legislation, Food United States *United States Food and Drug Administration"
23839750,Prevalence and extent of obstructive coronary artery disease among patients undergoing elective coronary catheterization in New York State and Ontario.,JAMA,Ko DT and Tu JV and Austin PC and Wijeysundera HC and Samadashvili Z and Guo H and Cantor WJ and Hannan EL,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Prior studies have shown that physicians in New York State (New York) perform twice as many cardiac catheterizations per capita as those in Ontario for stable patients. However, the role of patient selection in these findings and their implications for detection of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) are largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the extent of obstructive CAD and to compare the probability of detecting obstructive CAD for patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: An observational study was conducted involving patients without a history of cardiac disease who underwent elective cardiac catheterization between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2011. Obstructive CAD was defined as diameter stenosis of 50% or more in the left main coronary artery or stenosis of 70% or more in a major epicardial vessel. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Observed rates and predicted probabilities of obstructive CAD. Predicted probabilities were estimated using logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 18,114 patients from New York and 54,933 from Ontario were included. The observed rate of obstructive CAD was significantly lower in New York at 30.4% (95% CI, 29.7%-31.0%) than in Ontario at 44.8% (95% CI, 44.4%-45.3%; P < .001). The percentage of patients with left main or 3-vessel CAD was also significantly lower in New York than in Ontario (7.0% [95% CI, 6.6%-7.3%] vs 13.0% [95% CI, 12.8%-13.3%]; P < .001). In New York, a substantially higher percentage of patients with low predicted probability of obstructive CAD underwent cardiac catheterization; for example, only 19.3% (95% CI, 18.7%-19.9%) of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in New York had a greater than 50% predicted probability of having obstructive CAD than those in Ontario at 41% (95% CI, 40.6%-41.4%; P < .001). At 30 days, crude mortality for patients undergoing cardiac catheterization was slightly higher in New York at 0.65% (90 of 13,824; 95% CI, 0.51%-0.78%) than in Ontario at 0.38% (153 of 40,794; 95% CI, 0.32%-0.43%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In Ontario compared with New York State, patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization were significantly more likely to have obstructive CAD. This appears to be related to a higher percentage of patients in New York with low predicted probability of CAD undergoing cardiac catheterization.",Coronary Angiography/*utilization Coronary Artery Bypass/*utilization Fee-for-Service Plans/*statistics & numerical data Female Humans Male Medicare/*statistics & numerical data Medicare Part C/*statistics & numerical data Percutaneous Coronary Intervention/*utilization
23925621,Mental health response to community disasters: a systematic review.,JAMA,North CS and Pfefferbaum B,utsouthwestern,"IMPORTANCE: Exposure to a disaster is common, and one-third or more of individuals severely exposed may develop posttraumatic stress disorder or other disorders. A systematic approach to the delivery of timely and appropriate disaster mental health services may facilitate their integration into the emergency medical response. OBJECTIVE: To review and summarize the evidence for how best to identify individuals in need of disaster mental health services and triage them to appropriate care. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Search of the peer-reviewed English-language literature on disaster mental health response in PsycINFO, PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Academic Search Complete, and Google Scholar (inception to September 2012) and PILOTS (inception to February 2013), using a combination of subject headings and text words (Disasters, Natural Disasters, Mental Health, Mental Health Programs, Public Health Services, Mental Disorders, Mental Health Services, Community Mental Health Services, Emergency Services Psychiatric, Emotional Trauma, Triage, and Response). FINDINGS: Unlike physical injuries, adverse mental health outcomes of disasters may not be apparent, and therefore a systematic approach to case identification and triage to appropriate interventions is required. Symptomatic individuals in postdisaster settings may experience new-onset disaster-related psychiatric disorders, exacerbations of preexisting psychopathology, and/or psychological distress. Descriptive disaster mental health studies have found that many (11%-38%) distressed individuals presenting for evaluation at shelters and family assistance centers have stress-related and adjustment disorders; bereavement, major depression, and substance use disorders were also observed, and up to 40% of distressed individuals had preexisting disorders. Individuals with more intense reactions to disaster stress were more likely to accept referral to mental health services than those with less intense reactions. Evidence-based treatments are available for patients with active psychiatric disorders, but psychosocial interventions such as psychological first aid, psychological debriefing, crisis counseling, and psychoeducation for individuals with distress have not been sufficiently evaluated to establish their benefit or harm in disaster settings. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In postdisaster settings, a systematic framework of case identification, triage, and mental health interventions should be integrated into emergency medicine and trauma care responses.","Disasters Emergency Medical Services/*standards Humans *Mental Health Mental Health Services Risk Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*diagnosis/etiology *Triage"

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of pediatric readmissions and the magnitude of variation in pediatric readmission rates across hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We analyzed 568,845 admissions at 72 children's hospitals between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010, in the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions Case Mix Comparative data set. We estimated hierarchical regression models for 30-day readmission rates by hospital, accounting for age and Chronic Condition Indicators. Hospitals with adjusted readmission rates that were 1 SD above and below the mean were defined as having ""high"" and ""low"" rates, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Thirty-day unplanned readmissions following admission for any diagnosis and for the 10 admission diagnoses with the highest readmission prevalence. Planned readmissions were identified with procedure codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. RESULTS: The 30-day unadjusted readmission rate for all hospitalized children was 6.5% (n = 36,734). Adjusted rates were 28.6% greater in hospitals with high vs low readmission rates (7.2% [95% CI, 7.1%-7.2%] vs 5.6% [95% CI, 5.6%-5.6%]). For the 10 admission diagnoses with the highest readmission prevalence, the adjusted rates were 17.0% to 66.0% greater in hospitals with high vs low readmission rates. For example, sickle cell rates were 20.1% (95% CI, 20.0%-20.3%) vs 12.7% (95% CI, 12.6%-12.8%) in high vs low hospitals, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients admitted to acute care pediatric hospitals, the rate of unplanned readmissions at 30 days was 6.5%. There was significant variability in readmission rates across conditions and hospitals. These data may be useful for hospitals' quality improvement efforts.","Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Chronic Disease Diagnosis-Related Groups Female Hospitals, Pediatric/standards/*statistics & numerical data Humans Infant International Classification of Diseases/statistics & numerical data Male Patient Discharge Patient Readmission/*statistics & numerical data Quality Improvement *Quality Indicators, Health Care Retrospective Studies Time Factors United States"

The Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium was formed to perform multiplexed assays testing adenocarcinomas of the lung for drivers in 10 genes to enable clinicians to select targeted treatments and enroll patients into clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of oncogenic drivers in patients with lung adenocarcinomas and to use the data to select treatments targeting the identified driver(s) and measure survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From 2009 through 2012, 14 sites in the United States enrolled patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinomas and a performance status of 0 through 2 and tested their tumors for 10 drivers. Information was collected on patients, therapies, and survival. INTERVENTIONS: Tumors were tested for 10 oncogenic drivers, and results were used to select matched targeted therapies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Determination of the frequency of oncogenic drivers, the proportion of patients treated with genotype-directed therapy, and survival. RESULTS: From 2009 through 2012, tumors from 1007 patients were tested for at least 1 gene and 733 for 10 genes (patients with full genotyping). An oncogenic driver was found in 466 of 733 patients (64%). Among these 733 tumors, 182 tumors (25%) had the KRAS driver; sensitizing EGFR, 122 (17%); ALK rearrangements, 57 (8%); other EGFR, 29 (4%); 2 or more genes, 24 (3%); ERBB2 (formerly HER2), 19 (3%); BRAF, 16 (2%); PIK3CA, 6 (<1%); MET amplification, 5 (<1%); NRAS, 5 (<1%); MEK1, 1 (<1%); AKT1, 0. Results were used to select a targeted therapy or trial in 275 of 1007 patients (28%). The median survival was 3.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1.96-7.70) for the 260 patients with an oncogenic driver and genotype-directed therapy compared with 2.4 years (IQR, 0.88-6.20) for the 318 patients with any oncogenic driver(s) who did not receive genotype-directed therapy (propensity score-adjusted hazard ratio, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.53-0.9], P = .006). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Actionable drivers were detected in 64% of lung adenocarcinomas. Multiplexed testing aided physicians in selecting therapies. Although individuals with drivers receiving a matched targeted agent lived longer, randomized trials are required to determine if targeting therapy based on oncogenic drivers improves survival.

23478883,"Older adults and forgoing cancer screening: ""I think it would be strange"".",JAMA Intern Med,Torke AM and Schwartz PH and Holtz LR and Montz K and Sachs GA,iupui,"IMPORTANCE: Although there is a growing recognition that older adults and those with extensive comorbid conditions undergo cancer screening too frequently, there is little information about patients' perceptions regarding cessation of cancer screening. Information on older adults' views of screening cessation would be helpful both for clinicians and for those designing interventions to reduce overscreening. OBJECTIVE: To obtain a deeper understanding of older adults' perspectives on screening cessation and their experiences communicating with clinicians about this topic. DESIGN: Semistructured interview study. SETTING: Senior health center affiliated with an urban hospital. PARTICIPANTS: We interviewed 33 older adults presenting to a senior health center. Their median age was 76 years (range, 63-91 years). Of the 33 participants, 27 were women; 15 were African American, 16 were white, 1 was Asian, and 1 was American Indian. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We transcribed audio recordings of interviews and analyzed them using methods of grounded theory to identify themes and illustrative quotes. RESULTS: Undergoing screening tests was perceived by participants as morally obligatory. Although many saw continued screening as a habit or custom not involving any decision, cessation of screening would require a major decision. Many asserted that they had never discussed screening cessation with their physicians or considered stopping on their own; some reported being upset when their physician recommended stopping. Although some would accept a physician's strong recommendation to stop, others thought that such a physician's recommendation would threaten trust or lead them to get another opinion. Participants were skeptical about the role of statistics and the recommendations of government panels in screening decisions but were more favorable toward stopping because of the balance of risks and benefits, complications, or test burdens. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For many older adults, stopping screening is a major decision, but continuing screening is not. A physician's recommendation to stop may threaten patient trust. Effective strategies to reduce nonbeneficial screening may include discussion of the balance of risks and benefits, complications, or burdens.","Aged/*psychology Aged, 80 and over Attitude Attitude of Health Personnel Communication Decision Making Early Detection of Cancer/*psychology Female Humans Interviews as Topic Male Middle Aged Physician-Patient Relations"

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intermittent, reversible vagal nerve blockade therapy for obesity treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial involving 239 participants who had a body mass index of 40 to 45 or 35 to 40 and 1 or more obesity-related condition was conducted at 10 sites in the United States and Australia between May and December 2011. The 12-month blinded portion of the 5-year study was completed in January 2013. INTERVENTIONS: One hundred sixty-two patients received an active vagal nerve block device and 77 received a sham device. All participants received weight management education. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The coprimary efficacy objectives were to determine whether the vagal nerve block was superior in mean percentage excess weight loss to sham by a 10-point margin with at least 55% of patients in the vagal block group achieving a 20% loss and 45% achieving a 25% loss. The primary safety objective was to determine whether the rate of serious adverse events related to device, procedure, or therapy in the vagal block group was less than 15%. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat analysis, the vagal nerve block group had a mean 24.4% excess weight loss (9.2% of their initial body weight loss) vs 15.9% excess weight loss (6.0% initial body weight loss) in the sham group. The mean difference in the percentage of the excess weight loss between groups was 8.5 percentage points (95% CI, 3.1-13.9), which did not meet the 10-point target (P = .71), although weight loss was statistically greater in the vagal nerve block group (P = .002 for treatment difference in a post hoc analysis). At 12 months, 52% of patients in the vagal nerve block group achieved 20% or more excess weight loss and 38% achieved 25% or more excess weight loss vs 32% in the sham group who achieved 20% or more loss and 23% who achieved 25% or more loss. The device, procedure, or therapy-related serious adverse event rate in the vagal nerve block group was 3.7% (95% CI, 1.4%-7.9%), significantly lower than the 15% goal. The adverse events more frequent in the vagal nerve block group were heartburn or dyspepsia and abdominal pain attributed to therapy; all were reported as mild or moderate in severity. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with morbid obesity, the use of vagal nerve block therapy compared with a sham control device did not meet either of the prespecified coprimary efficacy objectives, although weight loss in the vagal block group was statistically greater than in the sham device group. The treatment was well tolerated, having met the primary safety objective.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the predictive validity and test-retest reliability of the Parent Attitudes About Childhood Vaccines survey (PACV), a recently developed measure of vaccine hesitancy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort of English-speaking parents of children aged 2 months and born from July 10 through December 10, 2010, who belonged to an integrated health care delivery system based in Seattle and who returned a completed baseline PACV. Parents who completed a follow-up survey 8 weeks later were included in the reliability analysis. Parents who remained continuous members in the delivery system until their child was 19 months old were included in the validity analysis. EXPOSURE: The PACV, scored on a scale of 0 to 100 (100 indicates high vaccine hesitancy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Child's immunization status as measured by the percentage of days underimmunized from birth to 19 months of age. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-seven parents completed the baseline PACV (response rate, 50.5%), and 220 (66.5%) completed the follow-up survey. Of the 437 parents who completed a baseline survey, 310 (70.9%) maintained continuous enrollment. Compared with parents who scored less than 50, parents who scored 50 to 69 on the survey had children who were underimmunized for 8.3% (95% CI, 3.6%-12.8%) more days from birth to 19 months of age; those who scored 70 to 100, 46.8% (40.3%-53.3%) more days. Baseline and 8-week follow-up PACV scores were highly concordant (rho = 0.844). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Scores on the PACV predict childhood immunization status and have high reliability.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether resveratrol levels achieved with diet are associated with inflammation, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in humans. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study, the Invecchiare in Chianti (InCHIANTI) Study (""Aging in the Chianti Region""), 1998 to 2009 conducted in 2 villages in the Chianti area in a population-based sample of 783 community-dwelling men and women 65 years or older. EXPOSURES: Twenty-four-hour urinary resveratrol metabolites. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were markers of inflammation (serum C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin [IL]-6, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]) and prevalent and incident cancer and cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: Mean (95% CI) log total urinary resveratrol metabolite concentrations were 7.08 (6.69-7.48) nmol/g of creatinine. During 9 years of follow-up, 268 (34.3%) of the participants died. From the lowest to the highest quartile of baseline total urinary resveratrol metabolites, the proportion of participants who died from all causes was 34.4%, 31.6%, 33.5%, and 37.4%, respectively (P = .67). Participants in the lowest quartile had a hazards ratio for mortality of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.54-1.17) compared with those in the highest quartile of total urinary resveratrol in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model that adjusted for potential confounders. Resveratrol levels were not significantly associated with serum CRP, IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF, prevalent or incident cardiovascular disease, or cancer. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In older community-dwelling adults, total urinary resveratrol metabolite concentration was not associated with inflammatory markers, cardiovascular disease, or cancer or predictive of all-cause mortality.

23532243,Sublingual immunotherapy for the treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma: a systematic review.,JAMA,Lin SY and Erekosima N and Kim JM and Ramanathan M and Suarez-Cuervo C and Chelladurai Y and Ward D and Segal JB,jhmi,"IMPORTANCE: Allergic rhinitis affects up to 40% of the US population. To desensitize allergic individuals, subcutaneous injection immunotherapy or sublingual immunotherapy may be administered. In the United States, sublingual immunotherapy is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. However, some US physicians use aqueous allergens, off-label, for sublingual desensitization. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the effectiveness and safety of aqueous sublingual immunotherapy for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through December 22, 2012. English-language randomized controlled trials were included if they compared sublingual immunotherapy with placebo, pharmacotherapy, or other sublingual immunotherapy regimens and reported clinical outcomes. Studies of sublingual immunotherapy that are unavailable in the United States and for which a related immunotherapy is unavailable in the United States were excluded. Paired reviewers selected articles and extracted the data. The strength of the evidence for each comparison and outcome was graded based on the risk of bias (scored on allocation, concealment of intervention, incomplete data, sponsor company involvement, and other bias), consistency, magnitude of effect, and the directness of the evidence. RESULTS: Sixty-three studies with 5131 participants met the inclusion criteria. Participants' ages ranged from 4 to 74 years. Twenty studies (n = 1814 patients) enrolled only children. The risk of bias was medium in 43 studies (68%). Strong evidence supports that sublingual immunotherapy improves asthma symptoms, with 8 of 13 studies reporting greater than 40% improvement vs the comparator. Moderate evidence supports that sublingual immunotherapy use decreases rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms, with 9 of 36 studies demonstrating greater than 40% improvement vs the comparator. Medication use for asthma and allergies decreased by more than 40% in 16 of 41 studies of sublingual immunotherapy with moderate grade evidence. Moderate evidence supports that sublingual immunotherapy improves conjunctivitis symptoms (13 studies), combined symptom and medication scores (20 studies), and disease-specific quality of life (8 studies). Local reactions were frequent, but anaphylaxis was not reported. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The overall evidence provides a moderate grade level of evidence to support the effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma, but high-quality studies are still needed to answer questions regarding optimal dosing strategies.

23754198,"Emotional, behavioral, and developmental features indicative of neglect or emotional abuse in preschool children: a systematic review.",JAMA Pediatr,Naughton AM and Maguire SA and Mann MK and Lumb RC and Tempest V and Gracias S and Kemp AM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Early intervention for neglect or emotional abuse in preschoolers may mitigate lifelong consequences, yet practitioners lack confidence in recognizing these children. OBJECTIVE: To define the emotional, behavioral, and developmental features of neglect or emotional abuse in preschoolers. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A literature search of 18 databases, 6 websites, and supplementary searching performed from January 1, 1960, to February 1, 2011, identified 22 669 abstracts. Standardized critical appraisal of 164 articles was conducted by 2 independent, trained reviewers. Inclusion criteria were children aged 0 to 6 years with confirmed neglect or emotional abuse who had emotional, behavioral, and developmental features recorded or for whom the carer-child interaction was documented. FINDINGS: Twenty-eight case-control (matched for socioeconomic, educational level, and ethnicity), 1 cross-sectional, and 13 cohort studies were included. Key features in the child included the following: aggression (11 studies) exhibited as angry, disruptive behavior, conduct problems, oppositional behavior, and low ego control; withdrawal or passivity (12 studies), including negative self-esteem, anxious or avoidant behavior, poor emotional knowledge, and difficulties in interpreting emotional expressions in others; developmental delay (17 studies), particularly delayed language, cognitive function, and overall development quotient; poor peer interaction (5 studies), showing poor social interactions, unlikely to act to relieve distress in others; and transition (6 studies) from ambivalent to avoidant insecure attachment pattern and from passive to increasingly aggressive behavior and negative self-representation. Emotional knowledge, cognitive function, and language deteriorate without intervention. Poor sensitivity, hostility, criticism, or disinterest characterize maternal-child interactions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Preschool children who have been neglected or emotionally abused exhibit a range of serious emotional and behavioral difficulties and adverse mother-child interactions that indicate that these children require prompt evaluation and interventions.","Child Child Abuse/*psychology *Child Behavior *Child Development Child, Preschool *Emotions Humans Infant"
23460396,Pharmacologic therapy for primary restless legs syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,JAMA Intern Med,Wilt TJ and MacDonald R and Ouellette J and Khawaja IS and Rutks I and Butler M and Fink HA,va,"IMPORTANCE: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs and a distressing, irresistible urge to move them. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate efficacy, safety, and comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for primary RLS. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published in English, reporting efficacy outcomes and harms of pharmacologic treatments for primary RLS of at least 4 weeks' duration. MEDLINE and other databases were searched through June 2012. Reviewers extracted outcomes and adverse events and rated the strength of evidence. RESULTS: We identified 29 eligible RCTs. We found high-strength evidence that the proportion of patients who had a clinically important response (International Restless Legs Syndrome [IRLS] responders), defined as a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in mean IRLS symptom scale scores, was greater with dopamine agonist therapy compared with placebo (61% vs 41%) (risk ratio, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.38-1.86]; 7 trials). Dopamine agonists also improved patient-reported sleep scale scores and quality-of-life measures. High-strength evidence demonstrated that calcium channel alpha-2-delta ligands increased the proportion of IRLS responders compared with placebo (61% vs 37%) (risk ratio, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.33-2.09]; 3 trials). Adverse events associated with dopamine agonists included nausea, vomiting, and somnolence. Alpha-2-delta ligands adverse events included somnolence and unsteadiness or dizziness. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: On the basis of short-term RCTs that enrolled highly selected populations with long-term high-moderate to very severe symptoms, dopamine agonists and calcium channel alpha-2-delta ligands reduced RLS symptoms and improved sleep outcomes and disease-specific quality of life.

23478891,Influence of obesity on clinical outcomes in hospitalized children: a systematic review.,JAMA Pediatr,Bechard LJ and Rothpletz-Puglia P and Touger-Decker R and Duggan C and Mehta NM,harvard,"IMPORTANCE: Obesity is prevalent among hospitalized children. Knowledge of the relationship between obesity and outcomes in hospitalized children will enhance nutrition assessment and provide opportunities for interventions. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the existing literature concerning the impact of obesity on clinical outcomes in hospitalized children. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were searched for studies of hospitalized children aged 2 to 18 years with identified obesity and at least 1 of the following clinical outcomes: all-cause mortality, incidence of infections, and length of hospital stay. Cohort and case-control studies were included. Cross-sectional studies, studies of healthy children, and those without defined criteria for classifying weight status were excluded. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess study quality. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies (26 retrospective; 24 cohort and 4 case-control) were included. Of the 21 studies that included mortality as an outcome, 10 reported a significant positive relationship between obesity and mortality. The incidence of infections was assessed in 8 of the 28 studies; 2 reported significantly more infections in obese compared with nonobese patients. Of the 11 studies that examined length of stay, 5 reported significantly longer lengths of hospital stay for obese children. Fifteen studies (53%) had a high quality score. Larger studies observed significant relationships between obesity and outcomes. Studies of critically ill, oncologic or stem cell transplant, and solid organ transplant patients showed a relationship between obesity and mortality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The available literature on the relationship between obesity and clinical outcomes is limited by subject heterogeneity, variations in criteria for defining obesity, and outcomes examined. Childhood obesity may be a risk factor for higher mortality in hospitalized children with critical illness, oncologic diagnoses, or transplants. Further examination of the relationship between obesity and clinical outcomes in this subgroup of hospitalized children is needed.","Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Cross Infection/epidemiology Hospital Mortality *Hospitalization Humans Length of Stay *Obesity/epidemiology *Pediatrics Treatment Outcome"
23754086,Pharmacologic and mechanical strategies for preventing venous thromboembolism after bariatric surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,JAMA Surg,Brotman DJ and Shihab HM and Prakasa KR and Kebede S and Haut ER and Sharma R and Shermock K and Chelladurai Y and Singh S and Segal JB,jhmi,"We sought to assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of pharmacologic and mechanical strategies to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. We searched (through August 2012) for primary studies that had at least 2 different interventions. Of 30,902 citations, we identified 8 studies of pharmacologic strategies and 5 studies of filter placement. No studies randomized patients to receive different interventions. One study suggested that low-molecular-weight heparin is more efficacious than unfractionated heparin in preventing VTE (0.25% vs 0.68%, P < .001), with no significant difference in bleeding. One study suggested that prolonged therapy (after discharge) with enoxaparin sodium may prevent VTE better than inpatient treatment only. There was insufficient evidence supporting the hypothesis that filters reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism, with a point estimate suggesting increased rates with filters (pooled relative risk [RR], 1.21 95% CI, 0.57-2.56). There was low-grade evidence that filters are associated with higher mortality (pooled RR, 4.30 95% CI, 1.60-11.54) and higher deep vein thrombosis rates (2.94 1.35-6.38). There was insufficient evidence to support that augmented subcutaneous enoxaparin doses (>40 mg daily or 30 mg twice daily) are more efficacious than standard dosing, with a trend toward increased bleeding. Of note, for both filters and augmented pharmacologic dosing strategies, patients at highest risk for VTE were more likely to receive more intensive interventions, limiting our ability to attribute outcomes to prophylactic strategies used.","Anticoagulants/therapeutic use *Bariatric Surgery Comparative Effectiveness Research Enoxaparin/therapeutic use Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight/therapeutic use Humans Postoperative Complications/*prevention & control Pulmonary Embolism/prevention & control Vena Cava Filters Venous Thromboembolism/*prevention & control"
23797846,Changing ethnic disparity in ischemic stroke mortality in US children after the STOP trial.,JAMA Pediatr,Lehman LL and Fullerton HJ,harvard,"IMPORTANCE: A prior report showed higher stroke mortality in US black children compared with white children (1979-1998), a disparity likely due in part to sickle cell disease, which leads to a high risk of childhood ischemic stroke. We hypothesized that this disparity has diminished since the publication of the Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP trial) in 1998 demonstrating the efficacy of long-term blood transfusions for primary stroke prevention. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the demographics and secular trends in mortality from ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (as a primary cause of death) in US children (<20 years) and determine if there has been a decrease in the disparity between white and black children since the publication of the STOP trial in 1998. DESIGN: We used death certificate data from the National Center for Health Statistics, 1988 through 2007. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: Children who died in 1988 through 2007 in the United States. INTERVENTION: Publication of the STOP trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence rate ratios were calculated as the measure of relative risk. RESULTS: Among 1.6 billion person-years of US children (1988-2007), there were 4425 deaths attributed to stroke, yielding an average of 221 deaths per year; 20% were ischemic; 67%, hemorrhagic; and 12%, unspecified. The relative risk of ischemic stroke mortality for black vs white children dropped from 1.74 from 1988 through 1997 to 1.27 from 1998 through 2007. The ethnic disparity in hemorrhagic stroke mortality, however, remained relatively stable between these 2 periods: black vs white relative risk, 1.90 (1988-1997) and 1.97 (1998-2007). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The excess risk of death from ischemic, but not hemorrhagic, stroke in US black children has decreased over the past decade. This may be related to the implementation of an effective ischemic stroke prevention strategy for children with sickle cell disease.",*African Americans Brain Ischemia/complications/*mortality Child *European Continental Ancestry Group Female *Health Status Disparities Humans Male Stroke/etiology/*mortality United States/epidemiology
23645144,"Mortality risk among children initially treated with dialysis for end-stage kidney disease, 1990-2010.",JAMA,Mitsnefes MM and Laskin BL and Dahhou M and Zhang X and Foster BJ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Most children with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are treated with dialysis prior to transplant. It is not known whether their outcomes have changed in recent years. OBJECTIVE: To determine if all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-related mortality rates for children and adolescents beginning dialysis improved between 1990 and 2010. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of patients younger than 21 years initially treated with dialysis for ESKD, recorded in the United States Renal Data System between 1990 and 2010. Children with a prior kidney transplant were excluded. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality associated with a 5-year increment in year of ESKD treatment initiation. Primary analyses censored observation at kidney transplant. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-related mortality. RESULTS: A total of 3450 children younger than 5 years and 19,951 children 5 years or older started dialysis from 1990-2010. Of those younger than 5 years, 705 died during dialysis treatment (98.8/1000 person-years); mortality rates were 112.2 and 83.4 per 1000 person-years in those initiating dialysis in 1990-1994 and 2005-2010, respectively. Of those 5 years and older at treatment initiation, 2270 died during dialysis treatment (38.6/1000 person-years). Their mortality rates were 44.6 and 25.9 per 1000 person-years in those initiating dialysis in 1990-1994 and 2005-2010, respectively. Each 5-year increment in calendar year of dialysis initiation was associated with an adjusted HR of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.85) among children younger than 5 years at initiation and an HR of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.85-0.92) among those 5 years and older. RESULTS: A total of 23,401 children and adolescents who initiated ESKD treatment with dialysis at younger than 21 years between 1990 and 2010 were identified. Crude mortality rates during dialysis treatment were higher among children younger than 5 years at the start of dialysis compared with those who were 5 years and older. Mortality rates for both children and adolescents being treated for ESKD with dialysis decreased significantly between 1990 and 2010. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the United States, there was a substantial decrease in mortality rates over time among children and adolescents initiating ESKD treatment with dialysis between 1990 and 2010. Further research is needed to determine the specific factors responsible for this decrease.","Adolescent Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality Cause of Death Child Child, Preschool Follow-Up Studies Humans Infection/mortality Kaplan-Meier Estimate Kidney Failure, Chronic/*mortality/*therapy Mortality/trends *Renal Dialysis Retrospective Studies Risk Treatment Outcome United States/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVE: To examine incident CHD by black and white race and by sex. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study of 24,443 participants without CHD at baseline from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort, who resided in the continental United States and were enrolled between 2003 and 2007 with follow-up through December 31, 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Expert-adjudicated total (fatal and nonfatal) CHD, fatal CHD, and nonfatal CHD (definite or probable myocardial infarction [MI]; very small non-ST-elevation MI [NSTEMI] had peak troponin level <0.5 mug/L). RESULTS: Over a mean (SD) of 4.2 (1.5) years of follow-up, 659 incident CHD events occurred (153 in black men, 138 in black women, 254 in white men, and 114 in white women). Among men, the age-standardized incidence rate per 1000 person-years for total CHD was 9.0 (95% CI, 7.5-10.8) for blacks vs 8.1 (95% CI, 6.9-9.4) for whites; fatal CHD: 4.0 (95% CI, 2.9-5.3) vs 1.9 (95% CI, 1.4-2.6), respectively; and nonfatal CHD: 4.9 (95% CI, 3.8-6.2) vs 6.2 (95% CI, 5.2-7.4). Among women, the age-standardized incidence rate per 1000 person-years for total CHD was 5.0 (95% CI, 4.2-6.1) for blacks vs 3.4 (95% CI, 2.8-4.2) for whites; fatal CHD: 2.0 (95% CI, 1.5-2.7) vs 1.0 (95% CI, 0.7-1.5), respectively; and nonfatal CHD: 2.8 (95% CI, 2.2-3.7) vs 2.2 (95% CI, 1.7-2.9). Age- and region-adjusted hazard ratios for fatal CHD among blacks vs whites was near 2.0 for both men and women and became statistically nonsignificant after multivariable adjustment. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for incident nonfatal CHD for blacks vs whites was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.51-0.91) for men and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.58-1.15) for women. Of the 444 nonfatal CHD events, 139 participants (31.3%) had very small NSTEMIs.

23188029,"Association of childhood pertussis with receipt of 5 doses of pertussis vaccine by time since last vaccine dose, California, 2010.",JAMA,Misegades LK and Winter K and Harriman K and Talarico J and Messonnier NE and Clark TA and Martin SW,cdc,"CONTEXT: In 2010, California experienced its largest pertussis epidemic in more than 60 years; a substantial burden of disease was noted in the 7- to 10-year-old age group despite high diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) coverage, indicating the possibility of waning protection. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between pertussis and receipt of 5 DTaP doses by time since fifth DTaP dose. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case-control evaluation conducted in 15 California counties. Cases (n = 682) were all suspected, probable, and confirmed pertussis cases among children aged 4 to 10 years reported from January through December 14, 2010; controls (n = 2016) were children in the same age group who received care from the clinicians reporting the cases. Three controls were selected per case. Vaccination histories were obtained from medical records and immunization registries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were (1) odds ratios (ORs) for the association between pertussis and receipt of the 5-dose DTaP series and (2) ORs for the association between pertussis and time since completion (<12, 12-23, 24-35, 36-47, 48-59, or >/=60 months) of the 5-dose DTaP series. Logistic regression was used to calculate ORs, accounting for clustering by county and clinician, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated as (1 - OR) x 100%. RESULTS: Among cases and controls, 53 (7.8%) and 19 (0.9%) had not received any pertussis-containing vaccines, respectively. Compared with controls, children with pertussis had a lower odds of having received all 5 doses of DTaP (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06-0.21 [estimated VE, 88.7%; 95% CI, 79.4%-93.8%]). When children were categorized by time since completion of the DTaP series, using an unvaccinated reference group, children with pertussis compared with controls were less likely to have received their fifth dose within the prior 12 months (19 [2.8%] vs 354 [17.6%], respectively; OR, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.01-0.04 [estimated VE, 98.1%; 95% CI, 96.1%-99.1%]). This association was evident with longer time since vaccination, with ORs increasing with time since the fifth dose. At 60 months or longer (n = 231 cases [33.9%] and n = 288 controls [14.3%]), the OR was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.15-0.54 [estimated VE, 71.2%; 95% CI, 45.8%-84.8%]). Accordingly, the estimated VE declined each year after receipt of the fifth dose of DTaP. CONCLUSION: Among children in 15 California counties, children with pertussis, compared with controls, had lower odds of having received the 5-dose DTaP series; as time since last DTaP dose increased, the odds increased, which is consistent with a progressive decrease in estimated vaccine effectiveness each year after the final dose of pertussis vaccine.","California/epidemiology Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis Vaccines/*administration & dosage/standards *Disease Outbreaks Female Humans *Immunization Schedule Logistic Models Male Odds Ratio Time Factors Whooping Cough/*epidemiology/*prevention & control"

OBJECTIVE: To assess psychiatric diagnoses and medication prescriptions before and after critical illness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study in Denmark of critically ill patients in 2006-2008 with follow-up through 2009, and 2 matched comparison cohorts from hospitalized patients and from the general population. EXPOSURES: Critical illness defined as intensive care unit admission with mechanical ventilation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) of psychiatrist-diagnosed psychiatric illnesses and prescriptions for psychoactive medications in the 5 years before critical illness. For patients with no psychiatric history, quarterly cumulative incidence (risk) and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for diagnoses and medications in the following year, using Cox regression. RESULTS: Among 24,179 critically ill patients, 6.2% had 1 or more psychiatric diagnoses in the prior 5 years vs 5.4% for hospitalized patients (adjusted PR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.22-1.42; P<.001) and 2.4% for the general population (adjusted PR, 2.57; 95% CI, 2.41-2.73; P<.001). Five-year preadmission psychoactive prescription rates were similar to hospitalized patients: 48.7% vs 48.8% (adjusted PR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99; P<.001) but were higher than the general population (33.2%; adjusted PR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.38-1.42; P<.001). Among the 9912 critical illness survivors with no psychiatric history, the absolute risk of new psychiatric diagnoses was low but higher than hospitalized patients: 0.5% vs 0.2% over the first 3 months (adjusted HR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.96-5.99; P <.001), and the general population cohort (0.02%; adjusted HR, 21.77; 95% CI, 9.23-51.36; P<.001). Risk of new psychoactive medication prescriptions was also increased in the first 3 months: 12.7% vs 5.0% for the hospital cohort (adjusted HR, 2.45; 95% CI, 2.19-2.74; P<.001) and 0.7% for the general population (adjusted HR, 21.09; 95% CI, 17.92-24.82; P<.001). These differences had largely resolved by 9 to 12 months after discharge. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Prior psychiatric diagnoses are more common in critically ill patients than in hospital and general population cohorts. Among survivors of critical illness, new psychiatric diagnoses and psychoactive medication use is increased in the months after discharge. Our data suggest both a possible role of psychiatric disease in predisposing patients to critical illness and an increased but transient risk of new psychiatric diagnoses and treatment after critical illness.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies Critical Illness/*epidemiology/*psychology Denmark/epidemiology Female Hospitalization Humans Incidence Male Mental Disorders/complications/drug therapy/*epidemiology Middle Aged Prevalence Psychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use Respiration, Artificial/*statistics & numerical data Risk Survivors/psychology Young Adult"
23462786,Association of fibrosis with mortality and sudden cardiac death in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.,JAMA,Gulati A and Jabbour A and Ismail TF and Guha K and Khwaja J and Raza S and Morarji K and Brown TD and Ismail NA and Dweck MR and Di Pietro E and Roughton M and Wage R and Daryani Y and O'Hanlon R and Sheppard MN and Alpendurada F and Lyon AR and Cook SA and Cowie MR and Assomull RG and Pennell DJ and Prasad SK,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Risk stratification of patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is primarily based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Superior prognostic factors may improve patient selection for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and other management decisions. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether myocardial fibrosis (detected by late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance [LGE-CMR] imaging) is an independent and incremental predictor of mortality and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in dilated cardiomyopathy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Prospective, longitudinal study of 472 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy referred to a UK center for CMR imaging between November 2000 and December 2008 after presence and extent of midwall replacement fibrosis were determined. Patients were followed up through December 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end point was all-cause mortality. Secondary end points included cardiovascular mortality or cardiac transplantation; an arrhythmic composite of SCD or aborted SCD (appropriate ICD shock, nonfatal ventricular fibrillation, or sustained ventricular tachycardia); and a composite of HF death, HF hospitalization, or cardiac transplantation. RESULTS: Among the 142 patients with midwall fibrosis, there were 38 deaths (26.8%) vs 35 deaths (10.6%) among the 330 patients without fibrosis (hazard ratio [HR], 2.96 [95% CI, 1.87-4.69]; absolute risk difference, 16.2% [95% CI, 8.2%-24.2%]; P < .001) during a median follow-up of 5.3 years (2557 patient-years of follow-up). The arrhythmic composite was reached by 42 patients with fibrosis (29.6%) and 23 patients without fibrosis (7.0%) (HR, 5.24 [95% CI, 3.15-8.72]; absolute risk difference, 22.6% [95% CI, 14.6%-30.6%]; P < .001). After adjustment for LVEF and other conventional prognostic factors, both the presence of fibrosis (HR, 2.43 [95% CI, 1.50-3.92]; P < .001) and the extent (HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.06-1.16]; P < .001) were independently and incrementally associated with all-cause mortality. Fibrosis was also independently associated with cardiovascular mortality or cardiac transplantation (by fibrosis presence: HR, 3.22 [95% CI, 1.95-5.31], P < .001; and by fibrosis extent: HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.10-1.20], P < .001), SCD or aborted SCD (by fibrosis presence: HR, 4.61 [95% CI, 2.75-7.74], P < .001; and by fibrosis extent: HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.05-1.16], P < .001), and the HF composite (by fibrosis presence: HR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.00-2.61], P = .049; and by fibrosis extent: HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.04-1.13], P < .001). Addition of fibrosis to LVEF significantly improved risk reclassification for all-cause mortality and the SCD composite (net reclassification improvement: 0.26 [95% CI, 0.11-0.41]; P = .001 and 0.29 [95% CI, 0.11-0.48]; P = .002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Assessment of midwall fibrosis with LGE-CMR imaging provided independent prognostic information beyond LVEF in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.

24515353,Effectiveness of peer-based healthy living lesson plans on anthropometric measures and physical activity in elementary school students: a cluster randomized trial.,JAMA Pediatr,Santos RG and Durksen A and Rabbanni R and Chanoine JP and Lamboo Miln A and Mayer T and McGavock JM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Schools are considered an attractive setting to promote healthy living behaviors in children, but previous school-based interventions aimed at preventing weight gain in children have yielded mixed results. Novel school-based approaches are needed to modify healthy living behaviors and attenuate weight gain in children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a peer-led healthy living program called Healthy Buddies on weight gain and its determinants when disseminated at the provincial level to elementary school students. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster-randomized effectiveness trial performed during the 2009-2010 school year. Baseline and follow-up measurements were made in October 2009 and May 2010, respectively. The study was performed in 19 elementary schools in Manitoba, Canada, and included 647 elementary school students aged 6 to 12 years (48% girls). INTERVENTION: Schools were randomized to receive regular curriculum or Healthy Buddies lesson plans. Lesson plans were delivered by older (9- to 12-year-old) elementary school students to the younger (6- to 8-year-old) peers and targeted 3 components of health: physical activity, healthy eating, and self-esteem and body image. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were the change in waist circumference and body mass index z score. Secondary outcomes included physical activity (steps per day), cardiorespiratory fitness, self-efficacy, healthy living knowledge, and self-reported dietary intake. RESULTS: At baseline, 36% of children were overweight or obese and 11% achieved the recommended 13,500 steps per day. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that waist circumference declined significantly in the intervention group relative to controls: -1.42 cm (-2.68 to -0.17; P = .03). Reductions in waist circumference were particularly significant for children who were younger, overweight or obese, or attending First Nations schools. No difference in body mass index z score was observed between groups. Self-efficacy, healthy living knowledge, and dietary intake significantly improved in younger peers who received the intervention compared with students from control schools. No differences were observed in daily step counts or cardiorespiratory fitness between the groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The implementation of Healthy Buddies lesson plans delivered by older peers within an elementary school setting is an effective method for attenuating increases in central adiposity and improving knowledge of healthy living behaviors among elementary school students.

23784448,Impact of screening colonoscopy on outcomes in colon cancer surgery.,JAMA Surg,Amri R and Bordeianou LG and Sylla P and Berger DL,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Screening colonoscopy seemingly decreases colorectal cancer rates in the United States. In addition to removing benign lesions and preventing progression to malignancy, screening colonoscopy theoretically identifies asymptomatic patients with early-stage disease, potentially leading to higher survival rates. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of screening colonoscopy on outcomes of colon cancer surgery by reviewing differences in staging, disease-free interval, risk of recurrence, and survival and to identify whether diagnosis through screening improves long-term outcomes independent of staging. DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospectively maintained, institutional review board-approved database. SETTING: Tertiary care center with high patient volume. PATIENTS: All patients who underwent colon cancer surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2011. INTERVENTION: Colon cancer surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Postoperative staging, death, and recurrence, measured as incidence and time to event. RESULTS: A total of 1071 patients were included, with 217 diagnosed through screening. Patients not diagnosed through screening were at risk for a more invasive tumor (>/=T3: relative risk [RR] = 1.96; P < .001), nodal disease (RR = 1.92; P < .001), and metastatic disease on presentation (RR = 3.37; P < .001). In follow-up, these patients had higher death rates (RR = 3.02; P < .001) and recurrence rates (RR = 2.19; P = .004) as well as shorter survival (P < .001) and disease-free intervals (P < .001). Cox and logistic regression controlling for staging and baseline characteristics revealed that death rate (P = .02) and survival duration (P = .01) were better stage for stage with diagnosis through screening. Death and metastasis rates also remained significantly lower in tumors without nodal or metastatic spread (all P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with colon cancer identified on screening colonoscopy not only have lower-stage disease on presentation but also have better outcomes independent of their staging. Compliance to screening colonoscopy guidelines can play an important role in prolonging longevity, improving quality of life, and reducing health care costs through early detection of colon cancer.","Adenocarcinoma/*diagnosis/*mortality/surgery Aged Aged, 80 and over Colonic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*mortality/surgery *Colonoscopy Disease-Free Survival Female Humans Male *Mass Screening Middle Aged Neoplasm Staging Retrospective Studies Survival Rate Treatment Outcome"

However, the optimal dose and duration are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a short-term (5 days) systemic glucocorticoid treatment in patients with COPD exacerbation is noninferior to conventional (14 days) treatment in clinical outcome and whether it decreases the exposure to steroids. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS REDUCE: (Reduction in the Use of Corticosteroids in Exacerbated COPD), a randomized, noninferiority multicenter trial in 5 Swiss teaching hospitals, enrolling 314 patients presenting to the emergency department with acute COPD exacerbation, past or present smokers (>/=20 pack-years) without a history of asthma, from March 2006 through February 2011. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with 40 mg of prednisone daily for either 5 or 14 days in a placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion. The predefined noninferiority criterion was an absolute increase in exacerbations of at most 15%, translating to a critical hazard ratio of 1.515 for a reference event rate of 50%. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Time to next exacerbation within 180 days. RESULTS: Of 314 randomized patients, 289 (92%) of whom were admitted to the hospital, 311 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and 296 in the per-protocol analysis. Hazard ratios for the short-term vs conventional treatment group were 0.95 (90% CI, 0.70 to 1.29; P = .006 for noninferiority) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.93 (90% CI, 0.68 to 1.26; P = .005 for noninferiority) in the per-protocol analysis, meeting our noninferiority criterion. In the short-term group, 56 patients (35.9%) reached the primary end point; 57 (36.8%) in the conventional group. Estimates of reexacerbation rates within 180 days were 37.2% (95% CI, 29.5% to 44.9%) in the short-term; 38.4% (95% CI, 30.6% to 46.3%) in the conventional, with a difference of -1.2% (95% CI, -12.2% to 9.8%) between the short-term and the conventional. Among patients with a reexacerbation, the median time to event was 43.5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 13 to 118) in the short-term and 29 days (IQR, 16 to 85) in the conventional. There was no difference between groups in time to death, the combined end point of exacerbation, death, or both and recovery of lung function. In the conventional group, mean cumulative prednisone dose was significantly higher (793 mg [95% CI, 710 to 876 mg] vs 379 mg [95% CI, 311 to 446 mg], P < .001), but treatment-associated adverse reactions, including hyperglycemia and hypertension, did not occur more frequently. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients presenting to the emergency department with acute exacerbations of COPD, 5-day treatment with systemic glucocorticoids was noninferior to 14-day treatment with regard to reexacerbation within 6 months of follow-up but significantly reduced glucocorticoid exposure. These findings support the use of a 5-day glucocorticoid treatment in acute exacerbations of COPD.

23212497,"Effects of 2- vs 4-week attending physician inpatient rotations on unplanned patient revisits, evaluations by trainees, and attending physician burnout: a randomized trial.",JAMA,Lucas BP and Trick WE and Evans AT and Mba B and Smith J and Das K and Clarke P and Varkey A and Mathew S and Weinstein RA,rush,"CONTEXT: Data are sparse on the effect of varying the durations of internal medicine attending physician ward rotations. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of 2- vs 4-week inpatient attending physician rotations on unplanned patient revisits, attending evaluations by trainees, and attending propensity for burnout. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized crossover noninferiority trial, with attending physicians as the unit of crossover randomization and 4-week rotations as the active control, conducted in a US university-affiliated teaching hospital in academic year 2009. Participants were 62 attending physicians who staffed at least 6 weeks of inpatient service, the 8892 unique patients whom they discharged, and the 147 house staff and 229 medical students who evaluated their performance. INTERVENTION: Assignment to random sequences of 2- and 4-week rotations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was 30-day unplanned revisits (visits to the hospital's emergency department or urgent ambulatory clinic, unplanned readmissions, and direct transfers from neighboring hospitals) for patients discharged from 2- vs 4-week within-attending-physician rotations. Noninferiority margin was a 2% increase (odds ratio [OR] of 1.13) in 30-day unplanned patient revisits. Secondary outcomes were length of stay; trainee evaluations of attending physicians; and attending physician reports of burnout, stress, and workplace control. RESULTS: Among the 8892 patients, there were 2437 unplanned revisits. The percentage of 30-day unplanned revisits for patients of attending physicians on 2-week rotations was 21.2% compared with 21.5% for 4-week rotations (mean difference, -0.3%; 95% CI, -1.8% to +1.2%). The adjusted OR of a patient having a 30-day unplanned revisit after 2- vs 4-week rotations was 0.97 (1-sided 97.5% upper confidence limit, 1.07; noninferiority P = .007). Average length of stay was not significantly different (geometric means for 2- vs 4-week rotations were 67.2 vs 67.5 hours; difference, -0.9%; 95% CI, -4.7% to +2.9%). Attending physicians were more likely to score lower in their ability to evaluate trainees after 2- vs 4-week rotations by both house staff (41% vs 28% rated less than perfect; adjusted OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.50-3.02) and medical students (82% vs 69% rated less than perfect; adjusted OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.06-2.10). They were less likely to report higher scores of both burnout severity (16% vs 35%; adjusted OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.26-0.58) and emotional exhaustion (19% vs 37%; adjusted OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.64) after 2- vs 4-week rotations. CONCLUSIONS: The use of 2-week inpatient attending physician rotations compared with 4-week rotations did not result in an increase in unplanned patient revisits. It was associated with better self-rated measures of attending physician burnout and emotional exhaustion but worse evaluations by trainees.

A smartphone-based application could provide effective continuing care. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients leaving residential treatment for alcohol use disorders with a smartphone application to support recovery have fewer risky drinking days than control patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An unmasked randomized clinical trial involving 3 residential programs operated by 1 nonprofit treatment organization in the Midwestern United States and 2 residential programs operated by 1 nonprofit organization in the Northeastern United States. In total, 349 patients who met the criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence when they entered residential treatment were randomized to treatment as usual (n = 179) or treatment as usual plus a smartphone (n = 170) with the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS), an application designed to improve continuing care for alcohol use disorders. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment as usual varied across programs; none offered patients coordinated continuing care after discharge. A-CHESS provides monitoring, information, communication, and support services to patients, including ways for patients and counselors to stay in contact. The intervention and follow-up period lasted 8 and 4 months, respectively. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risky drinking days--the number of days during which a patient's drinking in a 2-hour period exceeded 4 standard drinks for men and 3 standard drinks for women, with standard drink defined as one that contains roughly 14 g of pure alcohol (12 oz of regular beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of distilled spirits). Patients were asked to report their risky drinking days in the previous 30 days on surveys taken 4, 8, and 12 months after discharge from residential treatment. RESULTS: For the 8 months of the intervention and 4 months of follow-up, patients in the A-CHESS group reported significantly fewer risky drinking days than did patients in the control group, with a mean of 1.39 vs 2.75 days (mean difference, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.46-2.27; P = .003).

DESIGN: Case-control diagnostic accuracy study. SETTING: Academic dermatology department. PARTICIPANTS AND MATERIALS: Digital clinical images of pigmented cutaneous lesions (60 melanoma and 128 benign control lesions) with a histologic diagnosis rendered by a board-certified dermatopathologist, obtained before biopsy from patients undergoing lesion removal as a part of routine care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 4 smartphone applications designed to aid nonclinician users in determining whether their skin lesion is benign or malignant. RESULTS: Sensitivity of the 4 tested applications ranged from 6.8% to 98.1%; specificity, 30.4% to 93.7%; positive predictive value, 33.3% to 42.1%; and negative predictive value, 65.4% to 97.0%. The highest sensitivity for melanoma diagnosis was observed for an application that sends the image directly to a board-certified dermatologist for analysis; the lowest, for applications that use automated algorithms to analyze images. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of smartphone applications in assessing melanoma risk is highly variable, and 3 of 4 smartphone applications incorrectly classified 30% or more of melanomas as unconcerning. Reliance on these applications, which are not subject to regulatory oversight, in lieu of medical consultation can delay the diagnosis of melanoma and harm users.","Algorithms *Cellular Phone *Computers, Handheld Dermoscopy Diagnosis, Differential *Diagnostic Errors Electronic Mail Humans Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/methods Melanoma/*diagnosis ROC Curve Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis *Software Telemedicine/*instrumentation User-Computer Interface Video Recording/methods"

The association between smoking and adverse postoperative outcomes has been confirmed. Whether the associations are dose dependent or restricted to patients with smoking-related disease remains to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between current and past smoking on the risk of postoperative mortality and vascular and respiratory events in patients undergoing major surgery. DESIGN: Cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. We obtained data on smoking history, perioperative risk factors, and 30-day postoperative outcomes. We assessed the effects of current and past smoking (>1 year prior) on postoperative outcomes after adjustment for potential confounders and effect mediators (eg, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer). We also determined whether the effects are dose dependent through analysis of pack-year quintiles. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 607,558 adult patients undergoing major surgery in non-Veterans Affairs hospitals across the United States, Canada, Lebanon, and the United Arab Emirates during 2008 and 2009. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality; secondary outcome measures included arterial events (myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident), venous events (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), and respiratory events (pneumonia, unplanned intubation, or ventilator requirement >48 hours). RESULTS: The sample included 125,192 current (20.6%) and 78,763 past (13.0%) smokers. Increased odds of postoperative mortality were noted in current smokers only (odds ratio, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.10-1.24]). When we compared current and past smokers, the adjusted odds ratios were higher in the former for arterial events (1.65 [95% CI, 1.51-1.81] vs 1.20 [1.09-1.31], respectively) and respiratory events (1.45 [1.40-1.51] vs 1.13 [1.08-1.18], respectively). No effects on venous events were observed. The effects of smoking mediated through smoking-related disease were minimal. The increased adjusted odds of mortality in current smokers were evident from a smoking history of less than 10 pack-years, whereas the effects of smoking on arterial and respiratory events were incremental with increased pack-years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Smoking cessation at least 1 year before major surgery abolishes the increased risk of postoperative mortality and decreases the risk of arterial and respiratory events evident in current smokers. These findings should be carried forward to evaluate the value and cost-effectiveness of intervention in this setting. Our study should increase awareness of the detrimental effects of smoking-and the benefits of its cessation-on morbidity and mortality in the surgical setting.","Adult Aged Canada Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology Cohort Studies Female Humans Lebanon Male Middle Aged Pneumonia/*epidemiology Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology Respiration, Artificial Risk Factors Smoking/*adverse effects/*mortality United Arab Emirates United States"

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a community-based after-school soccer and youth development program, America SCORES, on students' physical activity, weight status, and fitness. DESIGN: Cluster-randomized trial. Study measures were collected in the fall (baseline), winter (midpoint), and spring (end point) of the 2009-2010 school year. SETTING: After-school programs in 6 schools within a large urban school district. PARTICIPANTS: All 4th and 5th grade students in after-school programs at the study schools were eligible. INTERVENTION: Three schools were randomized to receive the SCORES after-school program, delivered via the train-the-trainer model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in minutes of after-school moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), fitness (maximal oxygen consumption), and body mass index over 1 school year. RESULTS: Participants (n = 156) were diverse (42% Latino, 32% Asian, and 12% African American) and 76 (49%) had a body mass index at or above the 85th percentile. There were no significant group differences in the change in physical activity, fitness, or weight status among all students. However, among students with a body mass index at or above the 85th percentile, SCORES significantly increased MVPA after school (3.4 min/d; 95% CI, 0.3-6.5) and on Saturdays (18.5 minutes; 95% CI, 3.4-33.6). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Existing community-based programs such as SCORES can increase physical activity among low-income youth, particularly those most at risk for weight-related comorbidities. While evaluating existing programs presents special challenges, partnerships between communities, schools, and researchers are an important component of translational research to address obesity.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether daily consumption of a soy protein isolate supplement for 2 years reduces the rate of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy or delays such recurrence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind trial conducted from July 1997 to May 2010 at 7 US centers comparing daily consumption of a soy protein supplement vs placebo in 177 men at high risk of recurrence after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Supplement intervention was started within 4 months after surgery and continued for up to 2 years, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements made at 2-month intervals in the first year and every 3 months thereafter. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to receive a daily serving of a beverage powder containing 20 g of protein in the form of either soy protein isolate (n=87) or, as placebo, calcium caseinate (n=90). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Biochemical recurrence rate of prostate cancer (defined as development of a PSA level of >/=0.07 ng/mL) over the first 2 years following randomization and time to recurrence. RESULTS: The trial was stopped early for lack of treatment effects at a planned interim analysis with 81 evaluable participants in the intervention group and 78 in the placebo group. Overall, 28.3% of participants developed biochemical recurrence within 2 years of entering the trial (close to the a priori predicted recurrence rate of 30%). Among these, 22 (27.2%) occurred in the intervention group and 23 (29.5%) in the placebo group. The resulting hazard ratio for active treatment was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.53-1.72; log-rank P = .89). Adherence was greater than 90% and there were no apparent adverse events related to supplementation. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Daily consumption of a beverage powder supplement containing soy protein isolate for 2 years following radical prostatectomy did not reduce biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer in men at high risk of PSA failure.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if starting thrombolysis in a specialized ambulance reduces delays. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In the Prehospital Acute Neurological Treatment and Optimization of Medical care in Stroke Study (PHANTOM-S), conducted in Berlin, Germany, we randomly assigned weeks with and without availability of the Stroke Emergency Mobile (STEMO) from May 1, 2011, to January 31, 2013. Berlin has an established stroke care infrastructure with 14 stroke units. We included 6182 adult patients (STEMO weeks: 44.3% male, mean [SD] age, 73.9 [15.0] y; control weeks: 45.2% male, mean [SD] age, 74.3 [14.9] y) for whom a stroke dispatch was activated. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention comprised an ambulance (STEMO) equipped with a CT scanner, point-of-care laboratory, and telemedicine connection; a stroke identification algorithm at dispatcher level; and a prehospital stroke team. Thrombolysis was started before transport to hospital if ischemic stroke was confirmed and contraindications excluded. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was alarm-to-thrombolysis time. Secondary outcomes included thrombolysis rate, secondary intracerebral hemorrhage after thrombolysis, and 7-day mortality. RESULTS: Time reduction was assessed in all patients with a stroke dispatch from the entire catchment area in STEMO weeks (3213 patients) vs control weeks (2969 patients) and in patients in whom STEMO was available and deployed (1804 patients) vs control weeks (2969 patients). Compared with thrombolysis during control weeks, there was a reduction of 15 minutes (95% CI, 11-19) in alarm-to-treatment times in the catchment area during STEMO weeks (76.3 min; 95% CI, 73.2-79.3 vs 61.4 min; 95% CI, 58.7-64.0; P < .001). Among patients for whom STEMO was deployed, mean alarm-to-treatment time (51.8 min; 95% CI, 49.0-54.6) was shorter by 25 minutes (95% CI, 20-29; P < .001) than during control weeks. Thrombolysis rates in ischemic stroke were 29% (310/1070) during STEMO weeks and 33% (200/614) after STEMO deployment vs 21% (220/1041) during control weeks (differences, 8%; 95% CI, 4%-12%; P < .001, and 12%, 95% CI, 7%-16%; P < .001, respectively). STEMO deployment incurred no increased risk for intracerebral hemorrhage (STEMO deployment: 7/200; conventional care: 22/323; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.42, 95% CI, 0.18-1.03; P = .06) or 7-day mortality (9/199 vs 15/323; adjusted OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.31-1.82; P = .53).

23699725,Perioperative use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and risks for adverse outcomes of surgery.,JAMA Intern Med,Auerbach AD and Vittinghoff E and Maselli J and Pekow PS and Young JQ and Lindenauer PK,ucsf,"IMPORTANCE: Single-site studies have described an association between use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and adverse outcomes of surgery. Multicenter studies including a broad range of surgical procedures that explore rare outcomes, such as bleeding and mortality, and that account for indications for administration of SSRIs are needed. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether perioperative use of SSRIs is associated with adverse outcomes of surgery in a national sample of patients. DESIGN: Retrospective study of patients 18 years or older who underwent major surgery from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008, at 375 US hospitals. We used multivariable hierarchical models to estimate associations between SSRI use and our outcomes. Pharmacy data were used to determine whether a patient received an SSRI in the perioperative period. SETTING: Three hundred seventy-five US hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred thirty thousand four hundred sixteen patients 18 years or older. EXPOSURE: Perioperative use of SSRIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital mortality, length of stay, readmission at 30 days, bleeding events, transfusions, and incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. RESULTS: Patients receiving SSRIs were more likely to have obesity, chronic pulmonary disease, or hypothyroidism (P < .001 for each) and more likely to have depression (41.0% vs 6.2%, P < .001). After adjustment, patients receiving SSRIs had higher odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.07-1.36]), bleeding (1.09 [1.04-1.15]), and readmission at 30 days (1.22 [1.18-1.26]). Similar results were observed in propensity-matched analyses, although the risk of inpatient mortality was attenuated among patients with depression. Sensitivity analyses suggest that, to invalidate our results, an unmeasured covariate would have to have higher prevalence and be more strongly associated with mortality than any covariate included in our models. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Receiving SSRIs in the perioperative period is associated with a higher risk for adverse events. Determining whether patient factors or SSRIs themselves are responsible for elevated risks requires prospective study.","Aged Blood Transfusion/statistics & numerical data Female Follow-Up Studies Hospital Mortality Humans Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data Male Middle Aged Patient Readmission/statistics & numerical data *Perioperative Care Postoperative Hemorrhage/*chemically induced/*epidemiology/mortality Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Risk Factors Sampling Studies Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Surgical Procedures, Operative/adverse effects/*mortality Treatment Outcome United States/epidemiology Ventricular Fibrillation/*chemically induced/*epidemiology/mortality"
24710866,Effect of expansions in state Medicaid eligibility on access to care and the use of emergency department services for adult Medicaid enrollees.,JAMA Intern Med,Ndumele CD and Mor V and Allen S and Burgess JF Jr and Trivedi AN,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Medicaid enrollees typically report worse access to care than other insured populations. Expansions in Medicaid through less restrictive income eligibility requirements and the resulting influx of new enrollees may further erode access to care for those already enrolled in Medicaid. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of previous Medicaid expansions on self-reported access to care and the use of emergency department services by Medicaid enrollees. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design among 1714 adult Medicaid enrollees in 10 states that expanded Medicaid between June 1, 2000, and October 1, 2009, and 5097 Medicaid enrollees in 14 bordering control states that did not expand Medicaid. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported access to care and annualized emergency department use. RESULTS: Among states expanding their Medicaid program for adults, the mean income eligibility level increased from 82.6% to 144.2% of the federal poverty level. Income eligibility in matched control states remained constant at 77.1% of the federal poverty level. The proportion of adults reporting being enrolled in Medicaid increased from 7.2% to 8.8% in expansion states and from 6.1% to 6.4% in matched control states. In Medicaid program expansion states, the proportion of Medicaid enrollees reporting poor access to care declined from 8.5% before the expansion to 7.3% after the expansion. In matched control states, the proportion of Medicaid enrollees reporting poor access to care remained constant at 5.3%. The proportion of enrollees reporting any emergency department use decreased from 41.2% to 40.1% in expansion states and from 37.3% to 36.1% in matched control states. In the period following expansions, newly eligible enrollees reported poorer access to care than previously enrolled beneficiaries, although the overall difference between groups did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We found no evidence that expanding the number of individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage eroded perceived access to care or increased the use of emergency services among adult Medicaid enrollees.","Adolescent Adult Eligibility Determination Emergency Service, Hospital/*utilization Female Health Services Accessibility/*statistics & numerical data Humans Male Medicaid/*statistics & numerical data Middle Aged Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act United States Young Adult"
25244578,Effect of Statin Use During Hospitalization for Intracerebral Hemorrhage on Mortality and Discharge Disposition.,JAMA Neurol,Flint AC and Conell C and Rao VA and Klingman JG and Sidney S and Johnston SC and Hemphill JC and Kamel H and Davis SM and Donnan GA,Missing,"Importance: Statin use during hospitalization is associated with improved survival and a better discharge disposition among patients with ischemic stroke. It is unclear whether inpatient statin use has a similar effect among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Objective: To determine whether inpatient statin use in ICH is associated with improved outcomes and whether the cessation of statin use is associated with worsened outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of 3481 patients with ICH admitted to any of 20 hospitals in a large integrated health care delivery system over a 10-year period. Detailed electronic medical and pharmacy records were analyzed to explore the association between inpatient statin use and outcomes. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measures were survival to 30 days after ICH and discharge to home or inpatient rehabilitation facility. We used multivariable logistic regression, controlling for demographics, comorbidities, initial severity, and code status. In addition, we used instrumental variable modeling to control for confounding by unmeasured covariates at the individual patient level. Results: Among patients hospitalized for ICH, inpatient statin users were more likely than nonusers to be alive 30 days after ICH (odds ratio [OR], 4.25 [95% CI, 3.46-5.23]; P < .001) and were more likely than nonusers to be discharged to their home or an acute rehabilitation facility (OR, 2.57 [95% CI, 2.16-3.06]; P < .001). Patients whose statin therapy was discontinued were less likely than statin users to survive to 30 days (OR, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.12-0.21]; P < .001) and were less likely than statin users to be discharged to their home or an acute rehabilitation facility (OR, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.20-0.35]; P < .001). Instrumental variable models of local treatment environment (to control for confounding by unmeasured covariates) confirmed that a higher probability of statin therapy was associated with a higher probability of 30-day survival (with an increase in probability of 0.15 [95% CI, 0.04-0.25]; P = .01) and a better chance of being discharged to home or an acute rehabilitation facility (with an increase in probability of 0.13 [95% CI, 0.02-0.24]; P = .02). Conclusions and Relevance: Inpatient statin use is associated with improved outcomes after ICH, and the cessation of statin use is associated with worsened outcomes after ICH. Given the association between statin cessation and substantially worsened outcomes, the risk-benefit balance of discontinuing statin therapy in the acute setting of ICH should be carefully considered.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether statin use is associated with physical activity, longitudinally and cross-sectionally. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Men participating in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (N = 5994), a multicenter prospective cohort study of community-living men 65 years and older, enrolled between March 2000 and April 2002. Follow-up was conducted through 2009. EXPOSURES: Statin use as determined by an inventory of medications (taken within the last 30 days). In cross-sectional analyses (n = 4137), statin use categories were users and nonusers. In longitudinal analyses (n = 3039), categories were prevalent users (baseline use and throughout the study), new users (initiated use during the study), and nonusers (never used). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported physical activity at baseline and 2 follow-up visits using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). At the third visit, an accelerometer measured metabolic equivalents (METs [kilocalories per kilogram per hour]) and minutes of moderate activity (METs >/=3.0), vigorous activity (METs >/=6.0), and sedentary behavior (METs </=1.5). RESULTS: At baseline, 989 men (24%) were users and 3148 (76%) were nonusers. The adjusted difference in baseline PASE between users and nonusers was -5.8 points (95% CI, -10.9 to -0.7 points). A total of 3039 men met the inclusion criteria for longitudinal analysis: 727 (24%) prevalent users, 845 (28%) new users, and 1467 (48%) nonusers. PASE score declined by a mean (95% CI) of 2.5 (2.0 to 3.0) points per year for nonusers and 2.8 (2.1 to 3.5) points per year for prevalent users, a nonstatistical difference (0.3 [-0.5 to 1.0] points). For new users, annual PASE score declined at a faster rate than nonusers (difference of 0.9 [95% CI, 0.1 to 1.7] points). A total of 3071 men had adequate accelerometry data, 1542 (50%) were statin users. Statin users expended less METs (0.03 [95% CI, 0.02-0.04] METs less) and engaged in less moderate physical activity (5.4 [95% CI, 1.9-8.8] fewer minutes per day), less vigorous activity (0.6 [95% CI, 0.1-1.1] fewer minutes per day), and more sedentary behavior (7.6 [95% CI, 2.6-12.4] greater minutes per day). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Statin use was associated with modestly lower physical activity among community-living men, even after accounting for medical history and other potentially confounding factors. The clinical significance of these findings deserves further investigation.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy and safety of HSCT vs 12 successive monthly intravenous pulses of cyclophosphamide. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation International Scleroderma (ASTIS) trial, a phase 3, multicenter, randomized (1:1), open-label, parallel-group, clinical trial conducted in 10 countries at 29 centers with access to a European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation-registered transplant facility. From March 2001 to October 2009, 156 patients with early diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis were recruited and followed up until October 31, 2013. INTERVENTIONS: HSCT vs intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was event-free survival, defined as time from randomization until the occurrence of death or persistent major organ failure. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients were randomly assigned to receive HSCT (n = 79) or cyclophosphamide (n = 77). During a median follow-up of 5.8 years, 53 events occurred: 22 in the HSCT group (19 deaths and 3 irreversible organ failures) and 31 in the control group (23 deaths and 8 irreversible organ failures). During the first year, there were more events in the HSCT group (13 events [16.5%], including 8 treatment-related deaths) than in the control group (8 events [10.4%], with no treatment-related deaths). At 2 years, 14 events (17.7%) had occurred cumulatively in the HSCT group vs 14 events (18.2%) in the control group; at 4 years, 15 events (19%) had occurred cumulatively in the HSCT group vs 20 events (26%) in the control group. Time-varying hazard ratios (modeled with treatment x time interaction) for event-free survival were 0.35 (95% CI, 0.16-0.74) at 2 years and 0.34 (95% CI, 0.16-0.74) at 4 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with early diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, HSCT was associated with increased treatment-related mortality in the first year after treatment. However, HCST conferred a significant long-term event-free survival benefit.

Controversy exists as to whether use of steroids after hepatoportoenterostomy improves clinical outcome. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the addition of high-dose corticosteroids after hepatoportoenterostomy is superior to surgery alone in improving biliary drainage and survival with the native liver. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The multicenter, double-blind Steroids in Biliary Atresia Randomized Trial (START) was conducted in 140 infants (mean age, 2.3 months) between September 2005 and February 2011 in the United States; follow-up ended in January 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive intravenous methylprednisolone (4 mg/kg/d for 2 weeks) and oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/d for 2 weeks) followed by a tapering protocol for 9 weeks (n = 70) or placebo (n = 70) initiated within 72 hours of hepatoportoenterostomy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point (powered to detect a 25% absolute treatment difference) was the percentage of participants with a serum total bilirubin level of less than 1.5 mg/dL with his/her native liver at 6 months posthepatoportoenterostomy. Secondary outcomes included survival with native liver at 24 months of age and serious adverse events. RESULTS: The proportion of participants with improved bile drainage was not statistically significantly improved by steroids at 6 months posthepatoportoenterostomy (58.6% [41/70] of steroids group vs 48.6% [34/70] of placebo group; adjusted relative risk, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.57]; P = .43). The adjusted absolute risk difference was 8.7% (95% CI, -10.4% to 27.7%). Transplant-free survival was 58.7% in the steroids group vs 59.4% in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.8]; P = .99) at 24 months of age. The percentage of participants with serious adverse events was 81.4% [57/70] of the steroids group and 80.0% [56/70] of the placebo group (P > .99); however, participants receiving steroids had an earlier time of onset of their first serious adverse event by 30 days posthepatoportoenterostomy (37.2% [95% CI, 26.9% to 50.0%] of steroids group vs 19.0% [95% CI, 11.5% to 30.4%] of placebo group; P = .008). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among infants with biliary atresia who have undergone hepatoportoenterostomy, high-dose steroid therapy following surgery did not result in statistically significant treatment differences in bile drainage at 6 months, although a small clinical benefit could not be excluded. Steroid treatment was associated with earlier onset of serious adverse events in children with biliary atresia.

23188026,Associations between aldosterone antagonist therapy and risks of mortality and readmission among patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.,JAMA,Hernandez AF and Mi X and Hammill BG and Hammill SC and Heidenreich PA and Masoudi FA and Qualls LG and Peterson ED and Fonarow GC and Curtis LH,duke,"CONTEXT: Aldosterone antagonist therapy for heart failure and reduced ejection fraction has been highly efficacious in randomized trials. However, questions remain regarding the effectiveness and safety of the therapy in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical effectiveness of newly initiated aldosterone antagonist therapy among older patients hospitalized with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using clinical registry data linked to Medicare claims from 2005 through 2010, we examined outcomes of eligible patients hospitalized with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. We used Cox proportional hazards models and inverse-weighted estimates of the probability of treatment to adjust for treatment selection bias. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause mortality, cardiovascular readmission, and heart failure readmission at 3 years, and hyperkalemia readmission at 30 days and 1 year. RESULTS: Among 5887 patients who met the inclusion criteria, the mean age was 77.6 years; of those 1070 (18.2%) started aldosterone antagonist therapy at discharge. Cumulative incidence rates among treated and untreated patients were 49.9% vs 51.2% (P = .62) for mortality; 63.8% vs 63.9% (P = .65) for cardiovascular readmission; and 38.7% vs 44.9% (P < .001) for heart failure readmission at 3 years; and 2.9% vs 1.2% (P < .001) for hyperkalemia readmission within 30 days and 8.9% vs 6.3% (P = .002) within 1 year. After inverse weighting for the probability of treatment, there were no significant differences in mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.96-1.14; P = .32) and cardiovascular readmission (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.91-1.09; P = .94). Heart failure readmission was lower among treated patients at 3 years (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.98; P = .02). Readmission associated with hyperkalemia was higher with aldosterone antagonist therapy at 30 days (HR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.51-4.29; P < .001) and 1 year (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.23-1.84; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of aldosterone antagonist therapy at hospital discharge was not independently associated with improved mortality or cardiovascular readmission but was associated with improved heart failure readmission among eligible older patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. There was a significant increase in the risk of readmission with hyperkalemia, predominantly within 30 days after discharge.","Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Data Collection Female Heart Failure/*drug therapy/*mortality/physiopathology Humans Hyperkalemia/chemically induced Male Medicare/statistics & numerical data Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Patient Discharge Patient Readmission Registries/statistics & numerical data Risk Stroke Volume/*drug effects Treatment Outcome United States/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether brief intervention improves drug use outcomes compared with enhanced care as usual. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial with blinded assessments at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months conducted in 7 safety-net primary care clinics in Washington State. Of 1621 eligible patients reporting any problem drug use in the past 90 days, 868 consented and were randomized between April 2009 and September 2012. Follow-up participation was more than 87% at all points. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received a single brief intervention using motivational interviewing, a handout and list of substance abuse resources, and an attempted 10-minute telephone booster within 2 weeks (n = 435) or enhanced care as usual, which included a handout and list of substance abuse resources (n = 433). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were self-reported days of problem drug use in the past 30 days and Addiction Severity Index-Lite (ASI) Drug Use composite score. Secondary outcomes were admission to substance abuse treatment; ASI composite scores for medical, psychiatric, social, and legal domains; emergency department and inpatient hospital admissions, arrests, mortality, and human immunodeficiency virus risk behavior. RESULTS: Mean days used of the most common problem drug at baseline were 14.40 (SD, 11.29) (brief intervention) and 13.25 (SD, 10.69) (enhanced care as usual); at 3 months postintervention, means were 11.87 (SD, 12.13) (brief intervention) and 9.84 (SD, 10.64) (enhanced care as usual) and not significantly different (difference in differences, beta = 0.89 [95% CI, -0.49 to 2.26]). Mean ASI Drug Use composite score at baseline was 0.11 (SD, 0.10) (brief intervention) and 0.11 (SD, 0.10) (enhanced care as usual) and at 3 months was 0.10 (SD, 0.09) (brief intervention) and 0.09 (SD, 0.09) (enhanced care as usual) and not significantly different (difference in differences, beta = 0.008 [95% CI, -0.006 to 0.021]). During the 12 months following intervention, no significant treatment differences were found for either variable. No significant differences were found for secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A one-time brief intervention with attempted telephone booster had no effect on drug use in patients seen in safety-net primary care settings. This finding suggests a need for caution in promoting widespread adoption of this intervention for drug use in primary care.

24343296,Systematic review of the benefits and risks of metformin in treating obesity in children aged 18 years and younger.,JAMA Pediatr,McDonagh MS and Selph S and Ozpinar A and Foley C,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Childhood obesity is an important public health problem with increasing prevalence. Because treatment often has limited success, new approaches must be identified. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of metformin for treating obesity in children aged 18 years and younger without a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We included randomized clinical trials identified through searches of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Our primary outcome measure was change in body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). We assessed study quality, pooled data using a random-effects model, and performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: Fourteen randomized clinical trials were eligible. For BMI, moderate-strength evidence indicated a reduction of -1.38 (95% CI, -1.93 to -0.82) from baseline compared with control at 6 months. A similar, if less dramatic, effect was observed in studies less than 6 months, but the pooled estimate from studies of 1 year of treatment was not statistically significant. Subgroup analyses indicated smaller, but significant, effects for those with baseline BMI below 35, those of Hispanic ethnicity, those with acanthosis nigricans, those who had tried and failed diet and exercise programs, and in studies with more girls or higher mean age (adolescents). Moderate-strength evidence indicated that with metformin, 26% reported a gastrointestinal event compared with 13% in control groups (relative risk, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.19-3.54), although there was no difference in discontinuations due to adverse events. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Metformin provides a statistically significant, but very modest reduction in BMI when combined with lifestyle interventions over the short term. A large trial is needed to determine the benefits to subgroups or impacts of confounders. In the context of other options for treating childhood obesity, metformin has not been shown to be clinically superior.",Adolescent Body Mass Index Child Humans Hypoglycemic Agents/*therapeutic use Metformin/*therapeutic use Pediatric Obesity/*drug therapy Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Risk Factors Treatment Outcome Weight Loss/*drug effects

Despite the high incidence and resource burden of bronchiolitis, the mainstay of treatment remains supportive care, which frequently includes nasal suctioning. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between suctioning device type and suctioning lapses greater than 4 hours within the first 24 hours after hospital admission on length of stay (LOS) in infants with bronchiolitis. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. Data were extracted from the electronic health record. SETTING: Main hospital and satellite facility of a large quaternary care children's hospital from January 10, 2010, through April 30, 2011. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 740 infants aged 2 to 12 months and hospitalized with bronchiolitis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hospital LOS. RESULTS: In the multivariable model adjusted for inverse weighting for propensity to receive deep suctioning, increased deep suction as a percentage of suction events was associated with increased LOS with a geometric mean of 1.75 days (95% CI, 1.56-1.95 days) in patients with no deep suction and 2.35 days (2.10-2.62 days) in patients with more than 60% deep suction. An increased number of suctioning lapses was also associated with increased LOS in a dose-dependent manner with a geometric mean of 1.62 days (95% CI, 1.43-1.83 days) in patients with no lapses and 2.64 days (2.30-3.04 days) in patients with 3 or 4 lapses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For patients admitted with bronchiolitis, the use of deep suctioning in the first 24 hours after admission and lapses greater than 4 hours between suctioning events were associated with longer LOS.",Bronchiolitis/*therapy Female Humans Infant Length of Stay Male Multivariate Analysis Ohio Periodicity Propensity Score Respiratory Therapy/*instrumentation/methods Retrospective Studies Suction/*instrumentation/methods
24081194,Lower risk of cardiovascular events in postmenopausal women taking oral estradiol compared with oral conjugated equine estrogens.,JAMA Intern Med,Smith NL and Blondon M and Wiggins KL and Harrington LB and van Hylckama Vlieg A and Floyd JS and Hwang M and Bis JC and McKnight B and Rice KM and Lumley T and Rosendaal FR and Heckbert SR and Psaty BM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Little is known about the comparative cardiovascular safety of oral hormone therapy products, which impedes women from making informed safety decisions about hormone therapy to treat menopausal symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative clinical cardiovascular safety of 2 commonly used oral estrogen drugs-conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs) and estradiol. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based, case-control study from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2009, comparing cardiovascular event risk associated with current CEEs and estradiol use in a large health maintenance organization in which the preferred formulary estrogen changed from CEEs to estradiol during the course of data collection. Participants were 384 postmenopausal women aged 30 to 79 years using oral hormone therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident venous thrombosis was the primary clinical outcome, and incident myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke were secondary outcomes. As validation, an intermediate clotting phenotype, the endogenous thrombin potential-based normalized activated protein C sensitivity ratio, was measured in plasma of controls. RESULTS: We studied 68 venous thrombosis, 67 myocardial infarction, and 48 ischemic stroke cases, with 201 matched controls; all participants were current users of oral CEEs or estradiol. In adjusted analyses, current oral CEEs use compared with current oral estradiol use was associated with an increased venous thrombosis risk (odds ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.02-4.27; P = .045) and an increased myocardial infarction risk that did not reach statistical significance (odds ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 0.91-3.84; P = .09) and was not associated with ischemic stroke risk (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.55-2.31; P = .74). Among 140 controls, CEEs users compared with estradiol users had higher endogenous thrombin potential-based normalized activated protein C sensitivity ratios (P < .001), indicating a stronger clotting propensity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In an observational study of oral hormone therapy users, CEEs use was associated with a higher risk of incident venous thrombosis and possibly myocardial infarction than estradiol use. This risk differential was supported by biologic data. These findings need replication and suggest that various oral estrogen drugs may be associated with different levels of cardiovascular risk.","Adult Aged Cardiovascular Diseases Case-Control Studies Estradiol/*therapeutic use Estrogen Replacement Therapy/*methods Estrogens/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Estrogens, Conjugated (USP)/*therapeutic use Female Humans Middle Aged Myocardial Infarction/*epidemiology Odds Ratio Risk Factors Stroke/*epidemiology Venous Thrombosis/*epidemiology"
25226478,Clinical and safety outcomes associated with treatment of acute venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,JAMA,Castellucci LA and Cameron C and Le Gal G and Rodger MA and Coyle D and Wells PS and Clifford T and Gandara E and Wells G and Carrier M,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Many anticoagulant strategies are available for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism, yet little guidance exists regarding which drug is most effective and safe. OBJECTIVE: To summarize and compare the efficacy and safety outcomes associated with 8 anticoagulation options (unfractionated heparin [UFH], low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH], or fondaparinux in combination with vitamin K antagonists); LMWH with dabigatran or edoxaban; rivaroxaban; apixaban; and LMWH alone) for treatment of venous thromboembolism. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the evidence-based medicine reviews from inception through February 28, 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies were randomized trials reporting rates of recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding in patients with acute venous thromboembolism. Of the 1197 studies identified, 45 trials including 44,989 patients were included in the analyses. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently extracted trial-level data including number of patients, duration of follow-up, and outcomes. The data were pooled using network meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary clinical and safety outcomes were recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the LMWH-vitamin K antagonist combination, a treatment strategy using the UFH-vitamin K antagonist combination was associated with an increased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (hazard ratio [HR], 1.42; 95% credible interval [CrI], 1.15-1.79). The proportion of patients experiencing recurrent venous thromboembolism during 3 months of treatment were 1.84% (95% CrI, 1.33%-2.51%) for the UFH-vitamin K antagonist combination and 1.30% (95% CrI, 1.02%-1.62%) for the LMWH-vitamin K antagonist combination. Rivaroxaban (HR, 0.55; 95% CrI, 0.35-0.89) and apixaban (HR, 0.31; 95% CrI, 0.15-0.62) were associated with a lower risk of bleeding than was the LMWH-vitamin K antagonist combination, with a lower proportion of patients experiencing a major bleeding event during 3 months of anticoagulation: 0.49% (95% CrI, 0.29%-0.85%) for rivaroxaban, 0.28% (95% CrI, 0.14%-0.50%) for apixaban, and 0.89% (95% CrI, 0.66%-1.16%) for the LMWH-vitamin K antagonist combination. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using meta-analytic pooling, there were no statistically significant differences for efficacy and safety associated with most treatment strategies used to treat acute venous thromboembolism compared with the LMWH-vitamin K antagonist combination. However, findings suggest that the UFH-vitamin K antagonist combination is associated with the least effective strategy and that rivaroxaban and apixaban may be associated with the lowest risk for bleeding.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: To assess the combined safety and efficacy of tDCS vs a common pharmacological treatment (sertraline hydrochloride, 50 mg/d). DESIGN: Double-blind, controlled trial. Participants were randomized using a 2 x 2 factorial design to sertraline/placebo and active/sham tDCS. SETTING: Outpatient, single-center academic setting in Sao Paulo, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty antidepressant-free patients with moderate to severe, nonpsychotic, unipolar MDD. INTERVENTIONS: Six-week treatment of 2-mA anodal left/cathodal right prefrontal tDCS (twelve 30-minute sessions: 10 consecutive sessions once daily from Monday to Friday plus 2 extra sessions every other week) and sertraline hydrochloride (50 mg/d). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES In this intention-to-treat analysis, the primary outcome measure was the change in Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale score at 6 weeks (end point). We considered a difference of at least 3 points to be clinically relevant. The analysis plan was previously published. Safety was measured with an adverse effects questionnaire, the young mania rating scale, and cognitive assessment. Secondary measures were rates of clinical response and remission and scores on other scales. RESULTS: At the main end point, there was a significant difference in Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale scores when comparing the combined treatment group (sertraline/active tDCS) vs sertraline only (mean difference, 8.5 points; 95% CI, 2.96 to 14.03; P = .002), tDCS only (mean difference, 5.9 points; 95% CI, 0.36 to 11.43; P = .03), and placebo/sham tDCS (mean difference, 11.5 points; 95% CI, 6.03 to 17.10; P < .001). Analysis of tDCS only vs sertraline only presented comparable efficacies (mean difference, 2.6 points; 95% CI, -2.90 to 8.13; P = .35). Use of tDCS only (but not sertraline only) was superior to placebo/sham tDCS. Common adverse effects did not differ between interventions, except for skin redness on the scalp in active tDCS (P = .03). There were 7 episodes of treatment-emergent mania or hypomania, 5 occurring in the combined treatment group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In MDD, the combination of tDCS and sertraline increases the efficacy of each treatment. The efficacy and safety of tDCS and sertraline did not differ.

However, levels of these indicators may differ among population groups with HIV. Disparities in care and treatment may contribute to the higher incidence rates among groups with higher prevalence of HIV. OBJECTIVE: To examine differences between groups of persons living with HIV by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and transmission category at essential steps in the continuum of care. DESIGN AND SETTING: We obtained data from the National HIV Surveillance System of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the number of persons living with HIV who are aware and unaware of their infection using back-calculation models. We calculated the percentage of persons linked to care within 3 months of diagnosis on the basis of CD4 level and viral load test results. We estimated the percentages of persons retained in care, prescribed antiretroviral therapy, and with viral suppression using data from the Medical Monitoring Project, a surveillance system of persons receiving HIV care in select areas representative of all such persons in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: All HIV-infected persons in the United States. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Percentage of persons living with HIV who are aware of their infection, linked to care, retained in care, receiving antiretroviral therapy, and achieving viral suppression. RESULTS: Of the estimated 1,148,200 persons living with HIV in 2009 in the United States, 81.9% had been diagnosed, 65.8% were linked to care, 36.7% were retained in care, 32.7% were prescribed antiretroviral therapy, and 25.3% had a suppressed viral load (</=200 copies/mL). Overall, 857 276 persons with HIV had not achieved viral suppression, including 74.8% of male, 79.0% of black, 73.9% of Hispanic/Latino, and 70.3% of white persons. The percentage of blacks in each step of the continuum was lower than that for whites, but these differences were not statistically significant. Among persons with HIV who were 13 to 24 years of age, only 40.5% had received a diagnosis and 30.6% were linked to care. Persons aged 25 to 34, 35 to 44, and 45 to 54 years were all significantly less likely to achieve viral suppression than were persons aged 55 to 64 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Significant age disparities exist at each step of the continuum of care. Additional efforts are needed to ensure that all persons with HIV receive a diagnosis and optimal care to reduce morbidity, mortality, disparities in care and treatment, and ultimately HIV transmission. Ensuring that people stay in care and receive treatment will increase the proportion of HIV-infected individuals who achieve and maintain a suppressed viral load.",Adolescent Adult Age Factors Anti-Retroviral Agents/therapeutic use Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) Continental Population Groups/statistics & numerical data Continuity of Patient Care/*statistics & numerical data Female HIV Infections/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*epidemiology/transmission Health Services Needs and Demand Healthcare Disparities/statistics & numerical data Humans Male Middle Aged *Population Surveillance United States/epidemiology Viral Load Young Adult

OBJECTIVE: To derive and internally validate a prediction model for potentially avoidable 30-day hospital readmissions in medical patients using administrative and clinical data readily available prior to discharge. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS: All patient discharges from any medical services between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Potentially avoidable 30-day readmissions to 3 hospitals of the Partners HealthCare network were identified using a validated computerized algorithm based on administrative data (SQLape). A simple score was developed using multivariable logistic regression, with two-thirds of the sample randomly selected as the derivation cohort and one-third as the validation cohort. RESULTS: Among 10 731 eligible discharges, 2398 discharges (22.3%) were followed by a 30-day readmission, of which 879 (8.5% of all discharges) were identified as potentially avoidable. The prediction score identified 7 independent factors, referred to as the HOSPITAL score: h emoglobin at discharge, discharge from an o ncology service, s odium level at discharge, p rocedure during the index admission, i ndex t ype of admission, number of a dmissions during the last 12 months, and l ength of stay. In the validation set, 26.7% of the patients were classified as high risk, with an estimated potentially avoidable readmission risk of 18.0% (observed, 18.2%). The HOSPITAL score had fair discriminatory power (C statistic, 0.71) and had good calibration. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This simple prediction model identifies before discharge the risk of potentially avoidable 30-day readmission in medical patients. This score has potential to easily identify patients who may need more intensive transitional care interventions.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Algorithms Female Humans Logistic Models Male Middle Aged *Models, Theoretical Patient Discharge/*statistics & numerical data Patient Readmission/*statistics & numerical data Retrospective Studies"
24534899,A top-five list for emergency medicine: a pilot project to improve the value of emergency care.,JAMA Intern Med,Schuur JD and Carney DP and Lyn ET and Raja AS and Michael JA and Ross NG and Venkatesh AK,Missing,"IMPORTANCE The mean cost of medical care in the United States is growing at an unsustainable rate; from 2003 through 2011, the cost for an emergency department (ED) visit rose 240%, from $560 to $1354. The diagnostic tests, treatments, and hospitalizations that emergency clinicians order result in significant costs. OBJECTIVE To create a ""top-five"" list of tests, treatments, and disposition decisions that are of little value, are amenable to standardization, and are actionable by emergency medicine clinicians. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Modified Delphi consensus process and survey of 283 emergency medicine clinicians (physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners) from 6 EDs. INTERVENTION We assembled a technical expert panel (TEP) and conducted a modified Delphi process to identify a top-five list using a 4-step process. In phase 1, we generated a list of low-value clinical decisions from TEP brainstorming and e-mail solicitation of clinicians. In phase 2, the TEP ranked items on contribution to cost, benefit to patients, and actionability by clinicians. In phase 3, we surveyed all ordering clinicians from the 6 EDs regarding distinct aspects of each item. In phase 4, the TEP voted for a final top-five list based on survey results and discussion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A top-five list for emergency medicine. The TEP ranked items on contribution to cost, benefit to patients, and actionability by clinicians. The survey asked clinicians to score items on the potential benefit or harm to patients and the provider actionability of each item. Voting and surveys used 5-point Likert scales. A Pearson interdomain correlation was used. RESULTS Phase 1 identified 64 low-value items. Phase 2 narrowed this list to 7 laboratory tests, 3 medications, 4 imaging studies, and 3 disposition decisions included in the phase 3 survey (71.0% response rate). All 17 items showed a significant positive correlation between benefit and actionability (r, 0.19-0.37 [P </= .01]). One item received unanimous TEP support, 4 received majority support, and 12 received at least 1 vote. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our TEP identified clinical actions that are of low value and within the control of ED health care providers. This method can be used to identify additional actionable targets of overuse in emergency medicine.","Blood Coagulation Tests/utilization Consensus Cost Savings Decision Making Delphi Technique Diagnostic Imaging/utilization Emergency Medicine/*economics/*standards Emergency Service, Hospital/*economics/*standards Humans Pilot Projects *Quality Improvement Questionnaires United States"

Increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to cefixime have been identified worldwide and have been associated with reports of clinical failure. OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of clinical treatment failure of N. gonorrhoeae infections associated with the use of cefixime. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: A retrospective cohort study of culture-positive N. gonorrhoeae infections at a single sexual health clinic in Toronto, Canada, that routinely performs test of cure. The cohort comprised N. gonorrhoeae culture-positive individuals identified between May 1, 2010, and April 30, 2011, treated with cefixime as recommended by Public Health Agency of Canada guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cefixime treatment failure, defined as the repeat isolation of N. gonorrhoeae at the test-of-cure visit identical to the pretreatment isolate by molecular typing and explicit denial of reexposure. RESULTS: There were 291 N. gonorrhoeae culture-positive individuals identified. Of 133 who returned for test of cure, 13 were culture positive; 9 patients were determined to have experienced cefixime treatment failure, involving urethral (n = 4), pharyngeal (n = 2), and rectal (n = 3) sites. The overall rate of clinical treatment failure among those who had a test of cure was 6.77% (95% CI, 3.14%-12.45%; 9/133). The rate of clinical failure associated with a cefixime MIC of 0.12 mug/mL or greater was 25.0% (95% CI, 10.69%-44.87%; 7/28) compared with 1.90% (95% CI, 0.23%-6.71%; 2/105) of infections with cefixime MICs less than 0.12 mug/mL, with a relative risk of 13.13 (95% CI, 2.88-59.72; P < .001). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The rate of clinical failure following treatment of N. gonorrhoeae infections with cefixime was relatively high at a Toronto clinic and was associated with elevated MICs.","Adult Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use Cefixime/*pharmacology/therapeutic use Cohort Studies Drug Resistance, Microbial Female Gonorrhea/*drug therapy Humans Male Microbial Sensitivity Tests Middle Aged Neisseria gonorrhoeae/drug effects/*isolation & purification Ontario Retrospective Studies Risk Treatment Failure Young Adult"

Better evaluation of the costs of these infections could help providers and payers to justify investing in prevention. OBJECTIVE: To estimate costs associated with the most significant and targetable HAIs. DATA SOURCES: For estimation of attributable costs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed for the years 1986 through April 2013. For HAI incidence estimates, we used the National Healthcare Safety Network of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). STUDY SELECTION: Studies performed outside the United States were excluded. Inclusion criteria included a robust method of comparison using a matched control group or an appropriate regression strategy, generalizable populations typical of inpatient wards and critical care units, methodologic consistency with CDC definitions, and soundness of handling economic outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the economic impact of childhood food allergy in the United States and caregivers' willingness to pay for food allergy treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from November 28, 2011, through January 26, 2012. A representative sample of 1643 US caregivers of a child with a current food allergy were recruited for participation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Caregivers of children with food allergies were asked to quantify the direct medical, out-of-pocket, lost labor productivity, and related opportunity costs. As an alternative valuation approach, caregivers were asked their willingness to pay for an effective food allergy treatment. RESULTS: The overall economic cost of food allergy was estimated at $24.8 (95% CI, $20.6-$29.4) billion annually ($4184 per year per child). Direct medical costs were $4.3 (95% CI, $2.8-$6.3) billion annually, including clinician visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Costs borne by the family totaled $20.5 billion annually, including lost labor productivity, out-of-pocket, and opportunity costs. Lost labor productivity costs totaled $0.77 (95% CI, $0.53-$1.0) billion annually, accounting for caregiver time off work for medical visits. Out-of-pocket costs were $5.5 (95% CI, $4.7-$6.4) billion annually, with 31% stemming from the cost of special foods. Opportunity costs totaled $14.2 (95% CI, $10.5-$18.4) billion annually, relating to a caregiver needing to leave or change jobs. Caregivers reported a willingness to pay of $20.8 billion annually ($3504 per year per child) for food allergy treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Childhood food allergy results in significant direct medical costs for the US health care system and even larger costs for families with a food-allergic child.","Adolescent Caregivers Child Child, Preschool *Cost of Illness Cross-Sectional Studies Family Health Female Food Hypersensitivity/*economics Health Care Costs Humans Infant Male United States"
24988945,Effect of insurance expansion on utilization of inpatient surgery.,JAMA Surg,Ellimoottil C and Miller S and Ayanian JZ and Miller DC,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Enhanced access to preventive and primary care services is a primary focus of the Affordable Care Act, but the potential effect of this law on surgical care is not well defined. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the differential effect of insurance expansion on utilization of discretionary vs nondiscretionary inpatient surgery with Massachusetts health care reform as a natural experimental condition. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used the state inpatient databases from Massachusetts and 2 control states (New Jersey and New York) to identify nonelderly adult patients (aged 19-64 years) who underwent discretionary vs nondiscretionary surgical procedures from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2010. We defined discretionary surgery as elective, preference-sensitive procedures (eg, joint replacement and back surgery) and nondiscretionary surgery as imperative and potentially life-saving procedures (eg, cancer surgery and hip fracture repair). EXPOSURE: All surgical procedures in the study and control populations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Using July 1, 2007, as the transition point between the prereform and postreform periods, we performed a difference-in-differences analysis to estimate the effect of insurance expansion on rates of discretionary and nondiscretionary surgical procedures in the entire study population and for subgroups defined by race, income, and insurance status. We then extrapolated our results from Massachusetts to the entire US population. RESULTS: We identified a total of 836 311 surgical procedures during the study period. Insurance expansion was associated with a 9.3% increase in the use of discretionary surgery in Massachusetts (P = .02). Conversely, the rate of nondiscretionary surgery decreased by 4.5% (P = .009). We found similar effects for discretionary surgery in all subgroups, with the greatest increase observed for nonwhite participants (19.9% [P < .001]). Based on the findings in Massachusetts, we estimated that full implementation of national insurance expansion would yield an additional 465 934 discretionary surgical procedures by 2017. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Insurance expansion in Massachusetts was associated with increased rates of discretionary surgery and a concurrent decrease in rates of nondiscretionary surgery. If similar changes are seen nationally under the Affordable Care Act, the value of insurance expansion for surgical care may depend on the relative balance between increased expenditures and potential health benefits of greater access to elective inpatient procedures.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the proportion of US adults potentially affected by recent changes in recommendations for management of hypertension. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, nationally representative survey. PARTICIPANTS: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2005 and 2010 (n = 16,372), we evaluated hypertension control and treatment recommendations for US adults. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of adults estimated to meet guideline-based BP targets under the 2014 BP guideline and under the previous seventh Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) guideline. RESULTS: The proportion of younger adults (18-59 years) with treatment-eligible hypertension under the JNC 7 guideline was 20.3% (95% CI, 19.1%-21.4%) and decreased to 19.2% (95% CI, 18.1%-20.4%) under the 2014 BP guideline. Larger declines were observed among older adults (>/=60 years), decreasing from 68.9% (95% CI, 66.9%-70.8%) under JNC 7 to 61.2% (95% CI, 59.3%-63.0%) under the 2014 BP guideline. The proportion of adults with treatment-eligible hypertension who met BP goals increased slightly for younger adults, from 41.2% (95% CI, 38.1%-44.3%) under JNC 7 to 47.5% (95% CI, 44.4%-50.6%) under the 2014 BP guideline, and more substantially for older adults, from 40.0% (95% CI, 37.8%-42.3%) under JNC 7 to 65.8% (95% CI, 63.7%-67.9%) under the 2014 BP guideline. Overall, 1.6% (95% CI, 1.3%-1.9%) of US adults aged 18-59 years and 27.6% (95% CI, 25.9%-29.3%) of adults aged 60 years or older were receiving BP-lowering medication and meeting more stringent JNC 7 targets. These patients may be eligible for less stringent or no BP therapy with the 2014 BP guideline. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with the JNC 7 guideline, the 2014 BP guideline from the panel members appointed to the JNC 8 was associated with a reduction in the proportion of US adults recommended for hypertension treatment and a substantial increase in the proportion of adults considered to have achieved goal BP, primarily in older adults.","Adult Aged Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use *Blood Pressure Diabetes Complications Disease Management Female Humans Hypertension/*classification/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology Male Middle Aged *Practice Guidelines as Topic Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/complications United States/epidemiology"

Transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve implantation is a less invasive approach for patients with structural valve deterioration; however, a comprehensive evaluation of survival after the procedure has not yet been performed. OBJECTIVE: To determine the survival of patients after transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation inside failed surgical bioprosthetic valves. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Correlates for survival were evaluated using a multinational valve-in-valve registry that included 459 patients with degenerated bioprosthetic valves undergoing valve-in-valve implantation between 2007 and May 2013 in 55 centers (mean age, 77.6 [SD, 9.8] years; 56% men; median Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality prediction score, 9.8% [interquartile range, 7.7%-16%]). Surgical valves were classified as small (</=21 mm; 29.7%), intermediate (>21 and <25 mm; 39.3%), and large (>/=25 mm; 31%). Implanted devices included both balloon- and self-expandable valves. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Survival, stroke, and New York Heart Association functional class. RESULTS: Modes of bioprosthesis failure were stenosis (n = 181 [39.4%]), regurgitation (n = 139 [30.3%]), and combined (n = 139 [30.3%]). The stenosis group had a higher percentage of small valves (37% vs 20.9% and 26.6% in the regurgitation and combined groups, respectively; P = .005). Within 1 month following valve-in-valve implantation, 35 (7.6%) patients died, 8 (1.7%) had major stroke, and 313 (92.6%) of surviving patients had good functional status (New York Heart Association class I/II). The overall 1-year Kaplan-Meier survival rate was 83.2% (95% CI, 80.8%-84.7%; 62 death events; 228 survivors). Patients in the stenosis group had worse 1-year survival (76.6%; 95% CI, 68.9%-83.1%; 34 deaths; 86 survivors) in comparison with the regurgitation group (91.2%; 95% CI, 85.7%-96.7%; 10 deaths; 76 survivors) and the combined group (83.9%; 95% CI, 76.8%-91%; 18 deaths; 66 survivors) (P = .01). Similarly, patients with small valves had worse 1-year survival (74.8% [95% CI, 66.2%-83.4%]; 27 deaths; 57 survivors) vs with intermediate-sized valves (81.8%; 95% CI, 75.3%-88.3%; 26 deaths; 92 survivors) and with large valves (93.3%; 95% CI, 85.7%-96.7%; 7 deaths; 73 survivors) (P = .001). Factors associated with mortality within 1 year included having small surgical bioprosthesis (</=21 mm; hazard ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.14-3.67; P = .02) and baseline stenosis (vs regurgitation; hazard ratio, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.33-7.08; P = .008). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this registry of patients who underwent transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation for degenerated bioprosthetic aortic valves, overall 1-year survival was 83.2%. Survival was lower among patients with small bioprostheses and those with predominant surgical valve stenosis.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Aortic Valve/*surgery Aortic Valve Insufficiency/*surgery Aortic Valve Stenosis/*surgery *Bioprosthesis Cardiac Catheterization Female Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation/*methods Humans Male Middle Aged Prosthesis Design Prosthesis Failure Registries Survival Analysis Treatment Outcome"
24399555,"Tobacco control and the reduction in smoking-related premature deaths in the United States, 1964-2012.",JAMA,Holford TR and Meza R and Warner KE and Meernik C and Jeon J and Moolgavkar SH and Levy DT,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: January 2014 marks the 50th anniversary of the first surgeon general's report on smoking and health. This seminal document inspired efforts by governments, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector to reduce the toll of cigarette smoking through reduced initiation and increased cessation. OBJECTIVE: To model reductions in smoking-related mortality associated with implementation of tobacco control since 1964. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Smoking histories for individual birth cohorts that actually occurred and under likely scenarios had tobacco control never emerged were estimated. National mortality rates and mortality rate ratio estimates from analytical studies of the effect of smoking on mortality yielded death rates by smoking status. Actual smoking-related mortality from 1964 through 2012 was compared with estimated mortality under no tobacco control that included a likely scenario (primary counterfactual) and upper and lower bounds that would capture plausible alternatives. EXPOSURES: National Health Interview Surveys yielded cigarette smoking histories for the US adult population in 1964-2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number of premature deaths avoided and years of life saved were primary outcomes. Change in life expectancy at age 40 years associated with change in cigarette smoking exposure constituted another measure of overall health outcomes. RESULTS: In 1964-2012, an estimated 17.7 million deaths were related to smoking, an estimated 8.0 million (credible range [CR], 7.4-8.3 million, for the lower and upper tobacco control counterfactuals, respectively) fewer premature smoking-related deaths than what would have occurred under the alternatives and thus associated with tobacco control (5.3 million [CR, 4.8-5.5 million] men and 2.7 million [CR, 2.5-2.7 million] women). This resulted in an estimated 157 million years (CR, 139-165 million) of life saved, a mean of 19.6 years for each beneficiary (111 million [CR, 97-117 million] for men, 46 million [CR, 42-48 million] for women). During this time, estimated life expectancy at age 40 years increased 7.8 years for men and 5.4 years for women, of which tobacco control is associated with 2.3 years (CR, 1.8-2.5) (30% [CR, 23%-32%]) of the increase for men and 1.6 years (CR, 1.4-1.7) (29% [CR, 25%-32%]) for women. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Tobacco control was estimated to be associated with avoidance of 8 million premature deaths and an estimated extended mean life span of 19 to 20 years. Although tobacco control represents an important public health achievement, efforts must continue to reduce the effect of smoking on the nation's death toll.","Adult Aged Cohort Studies Female Government Regulation Health Surveys Humans *Life Expectancy Male Medical Records Middle Aged Models, Theoretical Mortality, Premature/*trends Prevalence Public Health Smoking/*mortality/*prevention & control Smoking Cessation *Social Control, Formal United States/epidemiology"
24197138,Antireflux procedures for gastroesophageal reflux disease in children: influence of patient age on surgical management.,JAMA Surg,McAteer J and Larison C and LaRiviere C and Garrison MM and Goldin AB,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common diagnosis in infants and children, but no objective criteria exist to guide the diagnosis and treatment of this disease in this population. The extent to which age influences decisions about surgical treatment in childhood GERD is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with progression to antireflux procedures (ARPs) in children hospitalized with GERD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study using inpatient data from 41 US children's hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System database. We included patients younger than 18 years discharged from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2010, with primary diagnostic codes for GERD (n = 141 190). We evaluated demographics, comorbidities, and diagnostic procedures descriptively and with a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. EXPOSURE: Patient age. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportional hazard of progression to ARP during admission. RESULTS: Of the 141,190 patients meeting study criteria, 11,621 (8.2%) underwent ARPs during the study period. More than half of patients undergoing ARPs (52.7%) were 6 months or younger. Although most patients in the ARP group had preoperative upper gastrointestinal tract fluoroscopy (65.0%), these patients did not undergo a uniform workup. The hazard of progression to an ARP was significantly decreased in children aged 7 months to 4 years (hazard ratio, 0.63 [P < .001]) and 5 to 17 years (0.43 [P < .001]) relative to children younger than 2 months. Hazard ratios were independently increased for comorbid diagnoses of failure to thrive, neurodevelopmental delay, cardiopulmonary anomalies, cerebral palsy, and aspiration pneumonia and among patients with tracheoesophageal fistula and diaphragmatic hernia. Each additional GERD-related hospitalization was associated with a 10% increased risk of an ARP. CONCLUSIONS AND REVELANCE: Antireflux procedures are most commonly performed in children during a period of life when regurgitation is normal and physiologic and objective measures of GERD are difficult to interpret. To identify meaningful outcomes after ARP, indications must be clear and standardized. We must clarify the appropriate workup for infants and young children with GERD and better define ""failure of medical management"" in this population.","Adolescent Age Factors Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Digestive System Surgical Procedures/methods/statistics & numerical data Female Gastroesophageal Reflux/*surgery Humans Infant Male Retrospective Studies"
23340588,Effect of pressure support vs unassisted breathing through a tracheostomy collar on weaning duration in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation: a randomized trial.,JAMA,Jubran A and Grant BJ and Duffner LA and Collins EG and Lanuza DM and Hoffman LA and Tobin MJ,lumc,"IMPORTANCE: Patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (>21 days) are commonly weaned at long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHs). The most effective method of weaning such patients has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: To compare weaning duration with pressure support vs unassisted breathing through a tracheostomy collar in patients transferred to an LTACH for weaning from prolonged ventilation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between 2000 and 2010, a randomized study was conducted in tracheotomized patients transferred to a single LTACH for weaning from prolonged ventilation. Of 500 patients who underwent a 5-day screening procedure, 316 did not tolerate the procedure and were randomly assigned to receive weaning with pressure support (n = 155) or a tracheostomy collar (n = 161). Survival at 6- and 12-month time points was also determined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcome was weaning duration. Secondary outcome was survival at 6 and 12 months after enrollment. RESULTS: Of 316 patients, 4 were withdrawn and not included in analysis. Of 152 patients in the pressure-support group, 68 (44.7%) were weaned; 22 (14.5%) died. Of 160 patients in the tracheostomy collar group, 85 (53.1%) were weaned; 16 (10.0%) died. Median weaning time was shorter with tracheostomy collar use (15 days; interquartile range [IQR], 8-25) than with pressure support (19 days; IQR, 12-31), P = .004. The hazard ratio (HR) for successful weaning rate was higher with tracheostomy collar use than with pressure support (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.03-1.98; P = .033) after adjusting for baseline clinical covariates. Use of the tracheostomy collar achieved faster weaning than did pressure support among patients who did not tolerate the screening procedure between 12 and 120 hours (HR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.44-7.70; P = .005), whereas weaning time was equivalent with the 2 methods in patients who did not tolerate the screening procedure within 0 to 12 hours. Mortality was equivalent in the pressure-support and tracheostomy collar groups at 6 months (55.92% vs 51.25%; 4.67% difference, 95% CI, -6.4% to 15.7%) and at 12 months (66.45% vs 60.00%; 6.45% difference, 95% CI, -4.2% to 17.1%). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation and treated at a single long-term care facility, unassisted breathing through a tracheostomy, compared with pressure support, resulted in shorter median weaning time, although weaning mode had no effect on survival at 6 and 12 months.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the combined risks of adolescence, ADHD, and distracted driving (cell phone conversation and text messaging) on driving performance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents aged 16 to 17 years with (n = 28) and without (n = 33) ADHD engaged in a simulated drive under 3 conditions (no distraction, cell phone conversation, and texting). During each condition, one unexpected event (eg, another car suddenly merging into driver's lane) was introduced. INTERVENTIONS: Cell phone conversation, texting, and no distraction while driving. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-report of driving history, average speed, standard deviation of speed, standard deviation of lateral position, and braking reaction time during driving simulation. RESULTS: Adolescents with ADHD reported fewer months of driving experience and a higher proportion of driving violations than control subjects. After controlling for months of driving history, adolescents with ADHD demonstrated more variability in speed and lane position than control subjects. There were no group differences for braking reaction time. Furthermore, texting negatively impacted the driving performance of all participants as evidenced by increased variability in speed and lane position. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to investigate distracted driving in adolescents with ADHD and adds to a growing body of literature documenting that individuals with ADHD are at increased risk for negative driving outcomes. Furthermore, texting significantly impairs the driving performance of all adolescents and increases existing driving-related impairment in adolescents with ADHD, highlighting the need for education and enforcement of regulations against texting for this age group.","Accidents, Traffic/*psychology Adolescent Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*physiopathology Automobile Driving/*psychology Cellular Phone/*statistics & numerical data Computer Simulation Female Humans Male Psychomotor Performance/*physiology Reaction Time/*physiology Risk Assessment Risk-Taking Text Messaging/*statistics & numerical data"

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether using 30 of 40 intervals to detect ventricular arrhythmias (VT) (long detection) during spontaneous fast VT episodes reduces antitachycardia pacing (ATP) and shock delivery more than 18 of 24 intervals (standard detection). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, single-blind, parallel-group trial that enrolled 1902 primary and secondary prevention patients (mean [SD] age, 65 [11] years; 84% men; 75% primary prevention ICD) with ischemic and nonischemic etiology undergoing first ICD implant at 1 of 94 international centers (March 2008-December 2010). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to programming with long- (n = 948) or standard-detection (n = 954) intervals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Total number of ATPs and shocks delivered for all episodes (primary outcomes) and inappropriate shocks, mortality, and syncopal rate (secondary outcomes). RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12 months (interquartile range, 11-13), long-detection group had 346 delivered therapies (42 therapies per 100 person-years, 95% CI, 38-47) vs 557 in the standard-detection group (67 therapies per 100 person-years [95% CI, 62-73]; incident rate ratio [IRR], 0.63 [95% CI, 0.51-0.78]; P < .001). The long- vs the standard-detection group experienced 23 ATPs per 100 person-years (95% CI, 20-27) vs 37 ATPs per 100 person-years (95% CI, 33-41; IRR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.47-0.72]; P < .001); 19 shocks per 100 person-years (95% CI, 16-22) vs 30 shocks per 100 person-years (95% CI, 26-34; IRR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.59-1.01]; P = .06), with a significant difference in the probability of therapy occurrence (P < .001); and a reduction in first occurrence of inappropriate shock (5.1 per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 3.7-6.9] vs 11.6 [95% CI, 9.4-14.1]; IRR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.36-0.85]; P = .008). Mortality (5.5 [95% CI, 4.0-7.2] vs 6.3 [95% CI, 4.8-8.2] per 100 patient-years; HR, 0.87; P = .50) and arrhythmic syncope rates (3.1 [95% CI, 2.6-4.6] vs 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-3.1] per 100 patient-years; IRR, 1.60 [95% CI, 0.76-3.41]; P = .22) did not differ significantly between groups.

Abdominal sacrocolpopexy is considered the most durable POP surgery, but little is known about safety and long-term effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To describe anatomic and symptomatic outcomes up to 7 years after abdominal sacrocolpopexy, and to determine whether these are affected by concomitant anti-incontinence surgery (Burch urethropexy). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Long-term follow-up of the randomized, masked 2-year Colpopexy and Urinary Reduction Efforts (CARE) trial of women with stress continence who underwent abdominal sacrocolpopexy between 2002 and 2005 for symptomatic POP and also received either concomitant Burch urethropexy or no urethropexy. Ninety-two percent (215/233) of eligible 2-year CARE trial completers were enrolled in the extended CARE study; and 181 (84%) and 126 (59%) completed 5 and 7 years of follow-up, respectively. The median follow-up was 7 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Symptomatic POP failure requiring retreatment or self-reported bulge; or anatomic POP failure requiring retreatment or Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification evaluation demonstrating descent of the vaginal apex below the upper third of the vagina, or anterior or posterior vaginal wall prolapse beyond the hymen. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) with more than 1 symptom or interval treatment; or overall UI score of 3 or greater on the Incontinence Severity Index. RESULTS: By year 7, the estimated probabilities of treatment failure (POP, SUI, UI) from parametric survival modeling for the urethropexy group and the no urethropexy group, respectively, were 0.27 and 0.22 for anatomic POP (treatment difference of 0.050; 95% CI, -0.161 to 0.271), 0.29 and 0.24 for symptomatic POP (treatment difference of 0.049; 95% CI, -0.060 to 0.162), 0.48 and 0.34 for composite POP (treatment difference of 0.134; 95% CI, -0.096 to 0.322), 0.62 and 0.77 for SUI (treatment difference of -0.153; 95% CI, -0.268 to 0.030), and 0.75 and 0.81 for overall UI (treatment difference of -0.064; 95% CI, -0.161 to 0.032). Mesh erosion probability at 7 years (estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method) was 10.5% (95% CI, 6.8% to 16.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: During 7 years of follow-up, abdominal sacrocolpopexy failure rates increased in both groups. Urethropexy prevented SUI longer than no urethropexy. Abdominal sacrocolpopexy effectiveness should be balanced with long-term risks of mesh or suture erosion.

The Mobile Acute Care of the Elderly (MACE) service is a novel model of care delivered by an interdisciplinary team, designed to deliver specialized care to hospitalized older adults to improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the MACE service when compared with general medical service (usual care). DESIGN: Prospective, matched cohort study. SETTING: The Mount Sinai Hospital, an urban tertiary acute care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 75 years or older admitted because of an acute illness to either the MACE service or usual care. Patients were matched for age, diagnosis, and ability to ambulate independently. EXPOSURES: Admission to the MACE service when compared with admission to usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient outcomes included incidence of adverse events, including falls, pressure ulcers, restraint use, and catheter-associated urinary tract infections, along with length of stay, rehospitalization within 30 days, functional status at 30 days, and patient satisfaction during care transitions, measured with the 3-item Care Transition Measure. RESULTS: A total of 173 matched pairs of patients were recruited. The mean (SD) age was 85.2 (5.3) and 84.7 (5.4) years in the MACE and usual-care groups, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, patients in the MACE group were less likely to experience adverse events (9.5% vs 17.0%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01-0.88; P = .04) and had shorter hospital stays (0.8 days, 95% CI, 0.7-0.9; P = .001) than patients receiving usual care. Patients in the MACE group were not less likely to have a lower rate of rehospitalization within 30 days than those in the usual-care group (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.39-2.10; P = .83). Functional status did not differ between the 2 groups. Care Transition Measure scores were 7.4 points (95% CI, 2.9-11.9; P = .001) higher in the MACE group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Admission to the MACE service was associated with lower rates of adverse events, shorter hospital stays, and better satisfaction. This model has the potential to improve care outcomes among hospitalized older adults.

DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary care hospitals in Boston, including Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: We identified 3568 individuals with AA seen in the Partners health care system in Boston between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2011. We performed comprehensive searches of the Research Patient Data Repository using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 704.01. We randomly selected 350 patients and manually reviewed their medical records to train and validate a novel artificial intelligence program. This program then used natural language processing to review free-text medical records and confirm a diagnosis of AA. To confirm the algorithm, we manually reviewed a subset of records and found 93.9% validity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The prevalence of comorbid conditions was assessed. RESULTS: Common comorbid conditions included autoimmune diagnoses (thyroid disease in 14.6%, diabetes mellitus in 11.1%, inflammatory bowel disease in (2.0%) [corrected], systemic lupus erythematosus in 4.3%, rheumatoid arthritis in 3.9%, and psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in (6.3%) [corrected], atopy (allergic rhinitis, asthma, and/or eczema in 38.2% and contact dermatitis and other eczema in 35.9%), and mental health problems (depression or anxiety in 25.5%). We also found high prevalences of hyperlipidemia (24.5%), hypertension (21.9%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (17.3%). This profile was different from that seen in a comparison psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis group.

Bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsies, the current diagnostic standard, has moderate sensitivity in assessing granulomas. Endosonography with intrathoracic nodal aspiration appears to be a promising diagnostic technique. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy vs endosonography in the diagnosis of stage I/II sarcoidosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized clinical multicenter trial (14 centers in 6 countries) between March 2009 and November 2011 of 304 consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary sarcoidosis (stage I/II) in whom tissue confirmation of noncaseating granulomas was indicated. INTERVENTIONS: Either bronchoscopy with transbronchial and endobronchial lung biopsies or endosonography (esophageal or endobronchial ultrasonography) with aspiration of intrathoracic lymph nodes. All patients also underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the diagnostic yield for detecting noncaseating granulomas in patients with a final diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The diagnosis was based on final clinical judgment by the treating physician, according to all available information (including findings from initial bronchoscopy or endosonography). Secondary outcomes were the complication rate in both groups and sensitivity and specificity of bronchoalveolar lavage in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. RESULTS: A total of 149 patients were randomized to bronchoscopy and 155 to endosonography. Significantly more granulomas were detected at endosonography vs bronchoscopy (114 vs 72 patients; 74% vs 48%; P < .001). Diagnostic yield to detect granulomas for endosonography was 80% (95% CI, 73%-86%); for bronchoscopy, 53% (95% CI, 45%-61%) (P < .001). Two serious adverse events occurred in the bronchoscopy group and 1 in the endosonography group; all patients recovered completely. Sensitivity of the bronchoalveolar lavage for sarcoidosis based on CD4/CD8 ratio was 54% (95% CI, 46%-62%) for flow cytometry and 24% (95% CI, 16%-34%) for cytospin analysis.

23340640,Association between quality improvement for care transitions in communities and rehospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries.,JAMA,Brock J and Mitchell J and Irby K and Stevens B and Archibald T and Goroski A and Lynn J,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Medicare beneficiaries experience errors during transitions among care settings, yielding harms that include unnecessary rehospitalizations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether implementation of improved care transitions for patients with Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) insurance is associated with reduced rehospitalizations and hospitalizations in geographic communities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Quality improvement initiative for care transitions by health care and social services personnel and Medicare Quality Improvement Organization staff in defined geographic areas, with monitoring by community-specific and aggregate control charts and evaluation with pre-post comparison of performance differences for 14 intervention communities and 50 comparison communities from before (2006-2008) and during (2009-2010) implementation. Intervention communities had between 22,070 and 90,843 Medicare FFS beneficiaries. INTERVENTION: Quality Improvement Organizations facilitated community-wide quality improvement activities to implement evidence-based improvements in care transitions by community organizing, technical assistance, and monitoring of participation, implementation, effectiveness, and adverse effects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was all-cause 30-day rehospitalizations per 1000 Medicare FFS beneficiaries; secondary outcome measures were all-cause hospitalizations per 1000 Medicare FFS beneficiaries and all-cause 30-day rehospitalizations as a percentage of hospital discharges. RESULTS: The mean rate of 30-day all-cause rehospitalizations per 1000 beneficiaries per quarter was 15.21 in 2006-2008 and 14.34 in 2009-2010 in the 14 intervention communities and was 15.03 in 2006-2008 and 14.72 in 2009-2010 in the 50 comparison communities, with the pre-post between-group difference showing larger reductions in rehospitalizations in intervention communities (by 0.56/1000 per quarter; 95% CI, 0.05-1.07; P = .03). The mean rate of hospitalizations per 1000 beneficiaries per quarter was 82.27 in 2006-2008 and 77.54 in 2009-2010 in intervention communities and was 82.09 in 2006-2008 and 79.48 in 2009-2010 in comparison communities, with the pre-post between-group difference showing larger reductions in hospitalizations in intervention communities (by 2.12/1000 per quarter; 95% CI, 0.47-3.77; P = .01). Mean community-wide rates of rehospitalizations as a percentage of hospital discharges in the intervention communities were 18.97% in 2006-2008 and 18.91% in 2009-2010 and were 18.76% in 2006-2008 and 18.91% in 2009-2010 in the comparison communities, with no significant difference in the pre-post between-group differences (0.22%; 95% CI, -0.08% to 0.51%; P = .14). Process control charts signaled onset of improvement coincident with initiating intervention. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among Medicare beneficiaries in intervention communities, compared with those in uninvolved communities, all-cause 30-day rehospitalization and all-cause hospitalization declined. However, there was no change in the rate of all-cause 30-day rehospitalizations as a percentage of hospital discharges.",Aged Delivery of Health Care Fee-for-Service Plans Humans Intervention Studies Medicare/*statistics & numerical data Outcome Assessment (Health Care) Patient Care/standards Patient Discharge/*statistics & numerical data Patient Readmission/*statistics & numerical data Quality Improvement/*organization & administration *Quality of Health Care Social Work United States

OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between default mode network integrity and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer disease pathology in cognitively normal older individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional cohort study at The Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri, among 207 older adults with normal cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating, 0). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging measures of default mode network integrity. RESULTS: Decreased cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 and increased cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau181 were independently associated with reduced default mode network integrity, with the most prominent decreases in functional connectivity observed between the posterior cingulate and medial temporal regions. Observed reductions in functional connectivity were unattributable to age or structural atrophy in the posterior cingulate and medial temporal areas. Similar resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging findings in relation to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers were obtained using region-of-interest analyses and voxelwise correlation mapping.

24566677,"Acetaminophen use during pregnancy, behavioral problems, and hyperkinetic disorders.",JAMA Pediatr,Liew Z and Ritz B and Rebordosa C and Lee PC and Olsen J,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is the most commonly used medication for pain and fever during pregnancy in many countries. Research data suggest that acetaminophen is a hormone disruptor, and abnormal hormonal exposures in pregnancy may influence fetal brain development. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether prenatal exposure to acetaminophen increases the risk for developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behavioral problems or hyperkinetic disorders (HKDs) in children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 64,322 live-born children and mothers enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort during 1996-2002. EXPOSURES: Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was assessed prospectively via 3 computer-assisted telephone interviews during pregnancy and 6 months after child birth. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: To ascertain outcome information we used (1) parental reports of behavioral problems in children 7 years of age using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; (2) retrieved HKD diagnoses from the Danish National Hospital Registry or the Danish Psychiatric Central Registry prior to 2011; and (3) identified ADHD prescriptions (mainly Ritalin) for children from the Danish Prescription Registry. We estimated hazard ratios for receiving an HKD diagnosis or using ADHD medications and risk ratios for behavioral problems in children after prenatal exposure to acetaminophen. RESULTS: More than half of all mothers reported acetaminophen use while pregnant. Children whose mothers used acetaminophen during pregnancy were at higher risk for receiving a hospital diagnosis of HKD (hazard ratio = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.19-1.59), use of ADHD medications (hazard ratio = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.15-1.44), or having ADHD-like behaviors at age 7 years (risk ratio = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27). Stronger associations were observed with use in more than 1 trimester during pregnancy, and exposure response trends were found with increasing frequency of acetaminophen use during gestation for all outcomes (ie, HKD diagnosis, ADHD medication use, and ADHD-like behaviors; P trend < .001). Results did not appear to be confounded by maternal inflammation, infection during pregnancy, the mother's mental health problems, or other potential confounders we evaluated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk for HKDs and ADHD-like behaviors in children. Because the exposure and outcome are frequent, these results are of public health relevance but further investigations are needed.","Acetaminophen/*adverse effects Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology Child Child, Preschool Denmark Female Humans Hyperkinesis/*chemically induced/diagnosis Infant Male Mental Disorders/*chemically induced/epidemiology Mothers Pregnancy Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Assessment Risk Factors"

OBJECTIVE: To test whether bullying and/or being bullied in childhood predicts psychiatric problems and suicidality in young adulthood after accounting for childhood psychiatric problems and family hardships. DESIGN: Prospective, population-based study. SETTING: Community sample from 11 counties in Western North Carolina. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1420 participants who had being bullied and bullying assessed 4 to 6 times between the ages of 9 and 16 years. Participants were categorized as bullies only, victims only, bullies and victims (hereafter referred to as bullies/victims), or neither. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Psychiatric outcomes, which included depression, anxiety, antisocial personality disorder, substance use disorders, and suicidality (including recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or a suicide attempt), were assessed in young adulthood (19, 21, and 24-26 years) by use of structured diagnostic interviews. RESULTS Victims and bullies/victims had elevated rates of young adult psychiatric disorders, but also elevated rates of childhood psychiatric disorders and family hardships. After controlling for childhood psychiatric problems or family hardships, we found that victims continued to have a higher prevalence of agoraphobia (odds ratio [OR], 4.6 [95% CI, 1.7-12.5]; P < .01), generalized anxiety (OR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.1-6.3]; P < .001), and panic disorder (OR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.5-6.5]; P < .01) and that bullies/victims were at increased risk of young adult depression (OR, 4.8 [95% CI, 1.2-19.4]; P < .05), panic disorder (OR, 14.5 [95% CI, 5.7-36.6]; P < .001), agoraphobia (females only; OR, 26.7 [95% CI, 4.3-52.5]; P < .001), and suicidality (males only; OR, 18.5 [95% CI, 6.2-55.1]; P < .001). Bullies were at risk for antisocial personality disorder only (OR, 4.1 [95% CI, 1.1-15.8]; P < .04).

24080985,Adverse neonatal outcomes associated with early-term birth.,JAMA Pediatr,Sengupta S and Carrion V and Shelton J and Wynn RJ and Ryan RM and Singhal K and Lakshminrusimha S,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Full-term neonates born between 37 and 41 weeks' gestational age have been considered a homogeneous, low-risk group. However, recent evidence from studies based on mode of delivery has pointed toward increased morbidity associated with early-term cesarean section births (37-38 weeks) compared with term neonates (39-41 weeks). OBJECTIVE: To compare the short-term morbidity of early-term vs term neonates in a county-based birth cohort using the primary objective of admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or neonatology service. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective population-based 3-year birth cohort study (January 1, 2006-December 31, 2008) at all major birth hospitals in Erie County, New York. All full-term live births comprised the birth cohort; this information was obtained from the hospitals' perinatal databases, and data pertaining to NICU or neonatology service admissions were extracted from individual medical records. EXPOSURE: Gestational age of early term (37(0/7)-38(6/7) weeks) vs term (39(0/7)-41(0/7) weeks). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Admission to the NICU or neonatology service. RESULTS: There were 33,488 live births during the 3-year period, of which 29,741 had a gestational age between 37 and 41 weeks. Of all live births, 9031 (27.0%) were early term. Compared with term infants, early-term neonates had significantly higher risks for the following: hypoglycemia (4.9% vs 2.5%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.92), NICU or neonatology service admission (8.8% vs 5.3%; adjusted OR, 1.64), need for respiratory support (2.0% vs 1.1%; adjusted OR, 1.93), requirement for intravenous fluids (7.5% vs 4.4%; adjusted OR, 1.68), treatment with intravenous antibiotics (2.6% vs 1.6%; adjusted OR, 1.62), and mechanical ventilation or intubation (0.6% vs 0.1%; adjusted OR, 4.57). Delivery by cesarean section was common among early-term births (38.4%) and increased the risk for NICU or neonatology service admission (12.2%) and morbidity (7.5%) compared with term births. Among vaginal deliveries, early-term neonates (6.8%) had a significantly higher rate of NICU or neonatology service admission compared with term neonates (4.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Early-term births are associated with high neonatal morbidity and with NICU or neonatology service admission. Evaluation of local prevalence data will assist in implementation of specific preventive measures and plans, as well as prioritize limited health care resources.","Cesarean Section/statistics & numerical data Delivery, Obstetric/adverse effects Female *Gestational Age Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data Humans Intensive Care Units, Neonatal Intubation, Intratracheal/statistics & numerical data Logistic Models Pregnancy *Pregnancy Outcome/epidemiology Risk Factors *Term Birth"
25074666,Population-based assessment of currently proposed ideals of nasal tip projection and rotation in young women.,JAMA Facial Plast Surg,Ahmed O and Dhinsa A and Popenko N and Osann K and Crumley RL and Wong BJ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: There is no universally accepted quantitative metric that defines the ideal nasal tip rotation and projection. OBJECTIVE: To identify the ideal nasal tip projection (NTP) and rotation by using 3 classic NTP methods (Crumley 1, Crumley 2, and Goode). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Lateral facial portraits of normal-appearing white women aged 18 to 25 years were selected from a previously validated and attractiveness-scored database of images. Each image was digitally modified to fit the NTP ideals outlined by the Crumley 1, Crumley 2, and Goode methods with columellar facial angles (rotation metric) of 96 degrees , 101 degrees , 106 degrees , 111 degrees , and 116 degrees (15 modified images per portrait). These variants were incorporated into electronic surveys that were distributed to traditional focus-group and online social-network participants. Analysis was performed using paired comparison analysis, a consumer preference research analytic. The traditional focus-group participants were undergraduate students at the University of California, Irvine, whose online social-network contacts were also used. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean ranks. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in preference between the traditional focus-group (n = 106) and online participants (n = 3872) (P > .05). The most preferred rotation variant for all 3 NTP methods was 106 degrees (Crumley 1: mean rank, 2.11 [95% CI, 2.07-2.16]; Crumley 2: mean rank, 2.07 [95% CI, 2.02-2.12]; and Goode: mean rank, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.99-2.11]; P < .001). Crumley 1 was considered to be the most attractive NTP method (mean rank, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.82-1.85]; P < .001) overall and was the most preferred NTP method for faces of above-average attractiveness (mean rank, 1.78 [95% CI, 1.76-1.80]; P < .001). No significantly preferred NTP method was found for faces of average attractiveness (P > .05). The most aesthetic combination of tip rotation and projection was a columellar facial angle of 106 degrees with the Crumley 1 tip projection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study to attempt to simultaneously determine the ideal NTP and rotation. Each classic NTP method uses measurements dependent on both projection and rotation; thus, ideal rotation for each NTP method must be determined before comparison of the ideals. A rotation of 106 degrees (columellar facial angle) was found to be the most aesthetic. The Crumley 1 method was determined to be the most attractive nasal tip variant overall.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In vivo PET at tertiary neuroscience referral center and ex vivo immunocytochemistry of autopsy-acquired brain tissue from a neuropathology archive. [11C]PiB PET was used to image amyloid deposition in 11 controls (median [range] age, 35 [24-60] years) and in 15 patients (median [range] age, 33 [21-50] years) between 1 and 361 days after a TBI. [3H]PiB autoradiography and immunocytochemistry for beta-amyloid (Abeta) and beta-amyloid precursor protein in brain tissue were obtained from separate cohorts of 16 patients (median [range] age, 46 [21-70] years) who died between 3 hours and 56 days after a TBI and 7 controls (median [range] age, 61 [29-71] years) who died of other causes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We quantified the [11C]PiB distribution volume ratio and standardized uptake value ratio in PET images. The distribution volume ratio and the standardized uptake value ratio were measured in cortical gray matter, white matter, and multiple cortical and white matter regions of interest, as well as in striatal and thalamic regions of interest. We examined [3H]PiB binding and Abeta and beta-amyloid precursor protein immunocytochemistry in autopsy-acquired brain tissue. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the patients with TBI showed significantly increased [11C]PiB distribution volume ratios in cortical gray matter and the striatum (corrected P < .05 for both), but not in the thalamus or white matter. Increases in [11C]PiB distribution volume ratios in patients with TBI were seen across most cortical subregions, were replicated using comparisons of standardized uptake value ratios, and could not be accounted for by methodological confounders. Autoradiography revealed [3H]PiB binding in neocortical gray matter, in regions where amyloid deposition was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry; white matter showed Abeta and beta-amyloid precursor protein by immunocytochemistry, but no [3H]PiB binding. No plaque-associated amyloid immunoreactivity or [3H]PiB binding was seen in cerebellar gray matter in autopsy-acquired tissue from either controls or patients with TBI, although 1 sample of cerebellar tissue from a patient with TBI showed amyloid angiopathy in meningeal vessels. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: [11C]PiB shows increased binding following TBI. The specificity of this binding is supported by neocortical [3H]PiB binding in regions of amyloid deposition in the postmortem tissue of patients with TBI.

OBJECTIVE: To determine associations between small-vessel disease and AD pathology. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study from January 2002 to December 2012 using the memory clinic-based Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. The study included 914 consecutive patients with available cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance imaging; 547 were patients diagnosed as having AD (54% female, mean [SD], 67 [8]; Mini-Mental State Examination score, mean [SD], 21 [5]), 30 were patients diagnosed as having vascular dementia (37% female, mean [SD], 76 [9]; Mini-Mental State Examination score, mean [SD], 24 [4]), and 337 were control participants with subjective memory complaints (42% female, mean [SD], 59 [59]; Mini-Mental State Examination score, mean [SD], 28 [2]). Linear regressions were performed with CSF biomarkers (log transformed) as dependent variables and magnetic resonance imaging measures (dichotomized) as independent, adjusted for sex, age, mediotemporal lobe atrophy, and diagnosis. An interaction term for diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging measures was used for estimates per diagnostic group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We examined the associations of magnetic resonance imaging white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, microbleeds with CSF beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42), total tau, and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181) as well as for a subset of apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers. RESULTS: Microbleed presence was associated with lower CSF Abeta42 in AD and vascular dementia (standardized beta = -0.09, P = .003; standardized beta = -0.30, P = .01), and higher CSF tau in controls (standardized beta = 0.10, P = .03). There were no effects for P-tau181. The presence of WMH was associated with lower Abeta42 in control participants and patients with vascular dementia (standardized beta = -0.18, P = .002; standardized beta = -0.32, P = .02) but not in patients with AD. There were no effects for tau or P-tau181. The presence of lacunes was associated with higher Abeta42 in vascular dementia (standardized beta = 0.17, P = .07) and lower tau in AD (standardized beta = -0.07, P = .05) but there were no effects for Abeta42 or P-tau181. Stratification for apolipoprotein E genotype revealed that these effects were mostly attributable to epsilon4 carriers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Deposition of amyloid appears aggravated in patients with cerebral small-vessel disease, especially in apolipoprotein E epsilon4 carriers, providing evidence for pathophysiological synergy between these 3 biological factors.","Aged Alzheimer Disease/*cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism/*pathology Amyloid beta-Peptides/cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism Apolipoprotein E4/cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism Biological Markers/cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases/*cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism/*pathology Cross-Sectional Studies Female Hemorrhage/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/pathology Heterozygote Detection Humans Male Middle Aged Peptide Fragments/cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism Phosphorylation Stroke, Lacunar/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/pathology tau Proteins/cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism"

24276343,Barriers to human papillomavirus vaccination among US adolescents: a systematic review of the literature.,JAMA Pediatr,Holman DM and Benard V and Roland KB and Watson M and Liddon N and Stokley S,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Since licensure of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in 2006, HPV vaccine coverage among US adolescents has increased but remains low compared with other recommended vaccines. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature on barriers to HPV vaccination among US adolescents to inform future efforts to increase HPV vaccine coverage. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched PubMed and previous review articles to identify original research articles describing barriers to HPV vaccine initiation and completion among US adolescents. Only articles reporting data collected in 2009 or later were included. Findings from 55 relevant articles were summarized by target populations: health care professionals, parents, underserved and disadvantaged populations, and males. FINDINGS: Health care professionals cited financial concerns and parental attitudes and concerns as barriers to providing the HPV vaccine to patients. Parents often reported needing more information before vaccinating their children. Concerns about the vaccine's effect on sexual behavior, low perceived risk of HPV infection, social influences, irregular preventive care, and vaccine cost were also identified as potential barriers among parents. Some parents of sons reported not vaccinating their sons because of the perceived lack of direct benefit. Parents consistently cited health care professional recommendations as one of the most important factors in their decision to vaccinate their children. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Continued efforts are needed to ensure that health care professionals and parents understand the importance of vaccinating adolescents before they become sexually active. Health care professionals may benefit from guidance on communicating HPV recommendations to patients and parents. Further efforts are also needed to reduce missed opportunities for HPV vaccination when adolescents interface with the health care system. Efforts to increase uptake should take into account the specific needs of subgroups within the population. Efforts that address system-level barriers to vaccination may help to increase overall HPV vaccine uptake.","Adolescent *Attitude of Health Personnel Female Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice *Health Services Accessibility Humans Male Papillomavirus Infections/*prevention & control/virology Papillomavirus Vaccines/*administration & dosage Parents/psychology Patient Acceptance of Health Care Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*prevention & control/virology Vaccination"

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that duodenal anastomoses for biliary reconstruction are at least as safe and effective as Roux-en-Y jejunal anastomoses, with the benefits of operative simplicity and ease of postoperative endoscopic evaluation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective record review with telephone survey of patients undergoing nonpalliative biliary reconstruction in the hepatopancreatobiliary surgery division of a high-volume tertiary care facility. INTERVENTIONS: Biliary reconstruction via either end-to-side Roux-en-Y jejunal anastomosis or direct duodenal anastomosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end points were anastomosis-related complications (leak, cholangitis, bile gastritis, or stricture), and the secondary end points were overall complications, endoscopic or radiologic interventions, readmissions, and death. RESULTS: Ninety-six nonpalliative biliary reconstructions were performed between February 1, 2000, and November 23, 2011 for bile duct injury, cholangiocarcinoma, choledochal cysts, or benign strictures; the procedures included 59 duodenal reconstructions and 37 Roux-en-Y jejunal reconstructions. The groups were similar with regard to demographics, operative indications, postoperative length of stay, and mortality rates. However, anastomosis-related complications (leaks, cholangitis, or strictures) were fewer in the duodenal than the jejunal cohort (7 patients [12%] vs 13 [35%]; P = .009). Of patients with stricture, 5 of 9 in the jejunal cohort required percutaneous transhepatic access for management compared with only 1 of 2 in the duodenal cohort. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Duodenal anastomosis is a safe, simple, and often preferable method for biliary reconstruction. This anastomosis can successfully be performed to all levels of the biliary tree with low rates of leak, stricture, cholangitis, and bile gastritis. When anastomotic complications do occur, there is less need for transhepatic intervention because of easier endoscopic access.","Adolescent Adult Aged Anastomosis, Surgical Biliary Tract Diseases/*surgery Comorbidity Duodenum/*surgery Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Jejunum/*surgery Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data Male Middle Aged Operative Time Postoperative Complications/prevention & control Reconstructive Surgical Procedures/*methods Retrospective Studies Treatment Outcome"

OBJECTIVES: To correlate several hematological markers evaluated at diagnosis with ALS outcome in a population-based series of patients (discovery cohort) and replicate the findings in an independent validation cohort from an ALS tertiary center. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The discovery cohort included 712 patients with ALS from the Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta Register for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2011. The validation cohort comprised 122 patients with ALS at different stages of disease consecutively seen at an ALS tertiary center between January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2009. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The following hematological factors were investigated and correlated with survival: total leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, glucose, creatinine, uric acid, albumin, bilirubin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, creatine kinase, thyroid-stimulating hormones, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate; all analyses were performed separately by sex. The patient of the validation cohort also underwent bioelectrical impedance analysis for the calculation of fat-free mass. RESULT: Of the 712 patients in the examined period in Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta, 638 (89.6%) were included in the study. Only serum albumin (men: </=4.3 vs >4.3 mg/dL, P < .001; women: </=4.3 vs >4.3 mg/dL, P < .001) and creatinine levels (men: </=0.82 vs >0.82 mg/dL, P = .004; women: </=0.65 vs >0.05 mg/dL, P = .004) and lymphocyte count (men: </=1700 vs >1700/muL, P = .04; women: </=1700 vs >1700/muL, P = .02) were significantly associated with ALS outcome in both sexes with a dose-response effect (better survival with increasing levels). These findings were confirmed in the validation cohort. Multivariable analysis showed that serum albumin (men: hazard ratio [HR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.05-1.90; P = .02; women: HR, 1.73; 95 % CI, 1.35-2.39; P = .001) and creatinine (men: HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.11-1.95; P = .007; women: HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.07-2.05; P = .02) were independent predictors of survival in both sexes; no other hematological factor was retained in the model. In patients with ALS, serum albumin was correlated with markers of inflammatory state while serum creatinine was correlated with fat-free mass, which is a marker of muscle mass. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In ALS, serum albumin and creatinine are independent markers of outcome in both sexes. Creatinine reflects the muscle waste whereas albumin is connected with inflammatory state.

In a clinical diagnostic capacity, the assay's likelihood ratios dramatically change an individual's pretest disease odds to posttest probabilities and can confirm vCJD infection. OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of a prototype blood test for vCJD and hence its suitability for clinical use and for screening prion-exposed populations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, cross-sectional diagnostic study of blood samples from national blood collection and prion disease centers in the United States and United Kingdom. Anonymized samples were representative of the US blood donor population (n = 5000), healthy UK donors (n = 200), patients with nonprion neurodegenerative diseases (n = 352), patients in whom a prion disease diagnosis was likely (n = 105), and patients with confirmed vCJD (n = 10). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Presence of vCJD infection determined by a prototype test (now in clinical diagnostic use) that captures, enriches, and detects disease-associated prion protein from whole blood using stainless steel powder. RESULTS: The assay's specificity among the presumed negative American donor samples was 100% (95% CI, 99.93%-100%) and was confirmed in a healthy UK cohort (100% specificity; 95% CI, 98.2%-100%). Of potentially cross-reactive blood samples from patients with nonprion neurodegenerative diseases, no samples tested positive (100% specificity; 95% CI, 98.9%-100%). Among National Prion Clinic referrals in whom a prion disease diagnosis was likely, 2 patients with sporadic CJD tested positive (98.1% specificity; 95% CI, 93.3%-99.8%). Finally, we reconfirmed but could not refine our previous sensitivity estimate in a small blind panel of samples from unaffected individuals and patients with vCJD (70% sensitivity; 95% CI, 34.8%-93.3%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In conjunction with the assay's established high sensitivity (71.4%; 95% CI, 47.8%-88.7%), the extremely high specificity supports using the assay to screen for vCJD infection in prion-exposed populations. Additionally, the lack of cross-reactivity and false positives in a range of nonprion neurodegenerative diseases supports the use of the assay in patient diagnosis.",Animals Cattle Cohort Studies Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome/*blood/*diagnosis/epidemiology Cross-Sectional Studies Feasibility Studies Great Britain/epidemiology Hematologic Tests/*methods/trends Humans Population Surveillance/*methods Prion Diseases/blood/diagnosis/epidemiology Retrospective Studies United States/epidemiology
23803651,Salience network-based classification and prediction of symptom severity in children with autism.,JAMA Psychiatry,Uddin LQ and Supekar K and Lynch CJ and Khouzam A and Phillips J and Feinstein C and Ryali S and Menon V,stanford,"IMPORTANCE: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 88 children and is characterized by a complex phenotype, including social, communicative, and sensorimotor deficits. Autism spectrum disorder has been linked with atypical connectivity across multiple brain systems, yet the nature of these differences in young children with the disorder is not well understood. OBJECTIVES: To examine connectivity of large-scale brain networks and determine whether specific networks can distinguish children with ASD from typically developing (TD) children and predict symptom severity in children with ASD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case-control study performed at Stanford University School of Medicine of 20 children 7 to 12 years old with ASD and 20 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched TD children. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Between-group differences in intrinsic functional connectivity of large-scale brain networks, performance of a classifier built to discriminate children with ASD from TD children based on specific brain networks, and correlations between brain networks and core symptoms of ASD. RESULTS: We observed stronger functional connectivity within several large-scale brain networks in children with ASD compared with TD children. This hyperconnectivity in ASD encompassed salience, default mode, frontotemporal, motor, and visual networks. This hyperconnectivity result was replicated in an independent cohort obtained from publicly available databases. Using maps of each individual's salience network, children with ASD could be discriminated from TD children with a classification accuracy of 78%, with 75% sensitivity and 80% specificity. The salience network showed the highest classification accuracy among all networks examined, and the blood oxygen-level dependent signal in this network predicted restricted and repetitive behavior scores. The classifier discriminated ASD from TD in the independent sample with 83% accuracy, 67% sensitivity, and 100% specificity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Salience network hyperconnectivity may be a distinguishing feature in children with ASD. Quantification of brain network connectivity is a step toward developing biomarkers for objectively identifying children with ASD.","Brain/*physiopathology Case-Control Studies Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/classification/diagnosis/*physiopathology Cohort Studies Connectome/classification/instrumentation/methods Female Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging/instrumentation/methods Male Nerve Net/*physiopathology Predictive Value of Tests Principal Component Analysis Sensitivity and Specificity Severity of Illness Index"
23615636,Brain response to empathy-eliciting scenarios involving pain in incarcerated individuals with psychopathy.,JAMA Psychiatry,Decety J and Skelly LR and Kiehl KA,uchicago,"IMPORTANCE: A marked lack of empathy is a hallmark characteristic of individuals with psychopathy. However, neural processes associated with empathic processing have not yet been directly examined in psychopathy, especially in response to the perception of other people in pain and distress. OBJECTIVE: To identify potential differences in patterns of neural activity in incarcerated individuals with psychopathy and incarcerated persons serving as controls during the perception of empathy-eliciting stimuli depicting other people experiencing pain. DESIGN: In a case-control study, brain activation patterns elicited by dynamic stimuli depicting individuals being harmed and facial expressions of pain were compared between incarcerated individuals with psychopathy and incarcerated controls. SETTING: Participants were scanned on the grounds of a correctional facility using the Mind Research Network's mobile 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging system. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty incarcerated men were classified according to scores on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) as high (27 men; PCL-R, >/=30), intermediate (28 men; PCL-R, 21-29), or low (25 men; PCL-R, </=20) levels of psychopathy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Neurohemodynamic response to empathy-eliciting dynamic scenarios revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Participants in the psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and periaqueductal gray relative to controls but showed greater activation in the insula, which was positively correlated with scores on both PCL-R factors 1 and 2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In response to pain and distress cues expressed by others, individuals with psychopathy exhibit deficits in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex regardless of stimulus type and display selective impairment in processing facial cues of distress in regions associated with cognitive mentalizing. A better understanding of the neural responses to empathy-eliciting stimuli in psychopathy is necessary to inform intervention programs.",Adolescent Adult Antisocial Personality Disorder/*physiopathology/psychology Brain/*physiopathology Case-Control Studies Empathy/*physiology Facial Expression Frontal Lobe/physiopathology Functional Neuroimaging Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Pain/*psychology Prisoners/*psychology Young Adult

OBJECTIVES: To quantify trends in the use of CT in pediatrics and the associated radiation exposure and cancer risk. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Seven US health care systems. PARTICIPANTS: The use of CT was evaluated for children younger than 15 years of age from 1996 to 2010, including 4 857 736 child-years of observation. Radiation doses were calculated for 744 CT scans performed between 2001 and 2011. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of CT use, organ and effective doses, and projected lifetime attributable risks of cancer. RESULTS The use of CT doubled for children younger than 5 years of age and tripled for children 5 to 14 years of age between 1996 and 2005, remained stable between 2006 and 2007, and then began to decline. Effective doses varied from 0.03 to 69.2 mSv per scan. An effective dose of 20 mSv or higher was delivered by 14% to 25% of abdomen/pelvis scans, 6% to 14% of spine scans, and 3% to 8% of chest scans. Projected lifetime attributable risks of solid cancer were higher for younger patients and girls than for older patients and boys, and they were also higher for patients who underwent CT scans of the abdomen/pelvis or spine than for patients who underwent other types of CT scans. For girls, a radiation-induced solid cancer is projected to result from every 300 to 390 abdomen/pelvis scans, 330 to 480 chest scans, and 270 to 800 spine scans, depending on age. The risk of leukemia was highest from head scans for children younger than 5 years of age at a rate of 1.9 cases per 10 000 CT scans. Nationally, 4 million pediatric CT scans of the head, abdomen/pelvis, chest, or spine performed each year are projected to cause 4870 future cancers. Reducing the highest 25% of doses to the median might prevent 43% of these cancers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The increased use of CT in pediatrics, combined with the wide variability in radiation doses, has resulted in many children receiving a high-dose examination. Dose-reduction strategies targeted to the highest quartile of doses could dramatically reduce the number of radiation-induced cancers.","Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Female Humans Male Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/*etiology *Radiation Dosage Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*adverse effects"
25133746,Cancer Screening Rates in Individuals With Different Life Expectancies.,JAMA Intern Med,Royce TJ and Hendrix LH and Stokes WA and Allen IM and Chen RC,Missing,"Importance: Routine cancer screening has unproven net benefit for patients with limited life expectancy. Objective: To examine the patterns of prostate, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening in the United States in individuals with different life expectancies. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data from the population-based National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 2000 through 2010 were used and included 27 404 participants aged 65 years or older. Using a validated mortality index specific for NHIS, participants were grouped into those with low (<25%), intermediate (25%-49%), high (50%-74%), and very high (>/=75%) risks of 9-year mortality. Main Outcomes and Measures: Rates of prostate, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. Results: In participants with very high mortality risk, 31% to 55% received recent cancer screening, with prostate cancer screening being most common (55%). For women who had a hysterectomy for benign reasons, 34% to 56% had a Papanicolaou test within the past 3 years. On multivariate analysis, very high vs low mortality risk was associated with less screening for prostate (odds ratio [OR], 0.65 [95% CI, 0.50-0.85]), breast (OR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.35-0.53]), and cervical (OR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.36-0.70]) cancers. There was less screening for prostate and cervical cancers in more recent years compared with 2000, and there was no significant interaction between calendar year and mortality risk for any cancer screening (P > .05 for all cancers). Our sensitivity analysis showed that screening was also common in individuals with less than 5-year life expectancy. Conclusions and Relevance: A substantial proportion of the US population with limited life expectancy received prostate, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening that is unlikely to provide net benefit. These results suggest that overscreening is common in both men and women, which not only increases health care expenditure but can lead to net patient harm.",Missing
23979011,"Association of cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid 1-42, T-tau, P-tau181, and alpha-synuclein levels with clinical features of drug-naive patients with early Parkinson disease.",JAMA Neurol,Kang JH and Irwin DJ and Chen-Plotkin AS and Siderowf A and Caspell C and Coffey CS and Waligorska T and Taylor P and Pan S and Frasier M and Marek K and Kieburtz K and Jennings D and Simuni T and Tanner CM and Singleton A and Toga AW and Chowdhury S and Mollenhauer B and Trojanowski JQ and Shaw LM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: We observed a significant correlation between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of tau proteins and alpha-synuclein, but not beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42), and lower concentration of CSF biomarkers, as compared with healthy controls, in a cohort of entirely untreated patients with Parkinson disease (PD) at the earliest stage of the disease studied so far. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the baseline characteristics and relationship to clinical features of CSF biomarkers (Abeta1-42, total tau [T-tau], tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 [P-tau181], and alpha-synuclein) in drug-naive patients with early PD and demographically matched healthy controls enrolled in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of the initial 102 research volunteers (63 patients with PD and 39 healthy controls) of the PPMI cohort. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The CSF biomarkers were measured by INNO-BIA AlzBio3 immunoassay (Abeta1-42, T-tau, and P-tau181; Innogenetics Inc) or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (alpha-synuclein). Clinical features including diagnosis, demographic characteristics, motor, neuropsychiatric, and cognitive assessments, and DaTscan were systematically assessed according to the PPMI study protocol. RESULTS: Slightly, but significantly, lower levels of Abeta1-42, T-tau, P-tau181, alpha-synuclein, and T-tau/Abeta1-42 were seen in subjects with PD compared with healthy controls but with a marked overlap between groups. Using multivariate regression analysis, we found that lower Abeta1-42 and P-tau181 levels were associated with PD diagnosis and that decreased CSF T-tau and alpha-synuclein were associated with increased motor severity. Notably, when we classified patients with PD by their motor phenotypes, lower CSF Abeta1-42 and P-tau181 concentrations were associated with the postural instability-gait disturbance-dominant phenotype but not with the tremor-dominant or intermediate phenotype. Finally, we found a significant correlation of the levels of alpha-synuclein with the levels of T-tau and P-tau181. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this first report of CSF biomarkers in PPMI study subjects,we found that measures of CSF Abeta1-42, T-tau, P-tau181, and alpha-synuclein have prognostic and diagnostic potential in early-stage PD.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate 2 specific Abeta oligomers, Abeta trimers and Abeta*56, in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); evaluate the effects of aging and AD; and obtain support for the hypothesis that they may be pathogenic by determining their relationships to CSF tau. DESIGN: A CSF sampling study. SETTINGS: The University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the Salhgrenska University Hospital, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight older adults with mild cognitive impairment or AD (impaired group); 49 age-matched cognitively intact control subjects (unimpaired group); and 10 younger, normal control subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements of CSF Abeta trimers, Abeta*56, the 42-amino acid Abeta isoform (Abeta1-42), total tau (T-tau), and phospho-tau 181 (p-tau(181)). The hypothesis being tested was formulated after data collection. RESULTS We observed that Abeta trimers and Abeta*56 levels increased with age; within the unimpaired group, they were elevated in subjects with T-tau/Abeta1-42 ratios greater than a cutoff that distinguished the unimpaired group from subjects with AD. In the unimpaired group, T-tau and p-tau(181) were found to correlate strongly with Abeta trimers and Abeta*56 (r > 0.63), but not with Abeta1-42 (-0.10 < r < -0.01). The strong correlations were found to be attenuated in the impaired group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In cognitively intact older adults, CSF Abeta trimers and Abeta*56 were elevated in individuals at risk for AD, and they showed stronger relationships with tau than did Abeta1-42, a surrogate for Abeta fibril deposition. These findings suggest that prior to overt symptoms, 1 or both of the Abeta oligomers, but not fibrillar Abeta, is coupled to tau; however, this coupling is weakened or broken when AD advances to symptomatic stages. The uncoupling is interesting in light of the failure of experimental Abeta therapies to improve mild cognitive impairment/AD, which has prompted a shift in the timing of Abeta therapies to asymptomatic subjects. Knowing which Abeta species to target in asymptomatic subjects may enhance the success of future treatments for AD.",Adult Age Factors Aging/*cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer Disease/*cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis/physiopathology Amyloid beta-Peptides/biosynthesis/*cerebrospinal fluid Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mild Cognitive Impairment/*cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis/physiopathology Peptide Fragments/biosynthesis/*cerebrospinal fluid tau Proteins/*cerebrospinal fluid
23860988,"The 2012 West Nile encephalitis epidemic in Dallas, Texas.",JAMA,Chung WM and Buseman CM and Joyner SN and Hughes SM and Fomby TB and Luby JP and Haley RW,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: After progressive declines over recent years, in 2012 West Nile virus epidemics resurged nationwide, with the greatest number of cases centered in Dallas County, Texas. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiologic, meteorologic, and geospatial features of the 2012 Dallas West Nile virus epidemic to guide future prevention efforts. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Public health surveillance of Dallas County, an area of 2257 km2 and population of 2.4 million. Surveillance data included numbers of residents diagnosed with West Nile virus infection between May 30, 2012, and December 3, 2012; mosquito trap results; weather data; and syndromic surveillance from area emergency departments. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence and age-adjusted incidence rates of West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND), daily prevalence of emergency department visits for asthma and skin rash, and Culex quinquefasciatus species-specific vector index (an estimate of the average number of West Nile virus-infected mosquitoes per trap-night). RESULTS: The investigation identified 173 cases of WNND, 225 of West Nile fever, 17 West Nile virus-positive blood donors, and 19 deaths in 2012. The incidence rate for WNND was 7.30 per 100,000 residents in 2012, compared with 2.91 per 100,000 in 2006, the largest previous Dallas County outbreak. An unusually rapid and early escalation of large numbers of human cases closely followed increasing infection trends in mosquitoes. The Cx quinquefasciatus species-specific vector index predicted the onset of symptoms among WNND cases 1 to 2 weeks later (count regression beta = 2.97 [95% CI, 2.34 to 3.60]; P < .001). Although initially widely distributed, WNND cases soon clustered in neighborhoods with high housing density in the north central area of the county, reflecting higher vector indices and following geospatial patterns of West Nile virus in prior years. During the 11 years since West Nile virus was first identified in Dallas, the log-transformed annual prevalence of WNND was inversely associated with the number of days with low temperatures below 28 degrees F (-2.2 degrees C) in December through February (beta = -0.29 [95% CI, -0.36 to -0.21]; P < .001). Aerial insecticide spraying was not associated with increases in emergency department visits for respiratory symptoms (beta = -4.03 [95% CI, -13.76 to 5.70]; P = .42) or skin rash (beta = -1.00 [95% CI, -6.92 to 4.92]; P = .74). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Large West Nile virus epidemics in Dallas County begin early after unusually warm winters, revisit similar geographical distributions, and are strongly predicted by the mosquito vector index. Consideration of weather patterns and historical geographical hot spots and acting on the vector index may help prevent West Nile virus-associated illness.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors Aged Animals Asthma/epidemiology Child Child, Preschool Culex/virology *Disease Outbreaks Emergency Service, Hospital/utilization Exanthema/epidemiology Female Geography, Medical Housing Humans Incidence Infant *Insect Vectors Insecticides Male Middle Aged Mosquito Control *Population Surveillance Prevalence Retrospective Studies Seasons Texas/epidemiology West Nile Fever/*epidemiology West Nile virus/*isolation & purification"

OBJECTIVES: To compare incidentally discovered (ID) thyroid cancer via non-thyroid-related imaging with nonincidentally discovered (NID) thyroid cancer, as well as determine if differences in tumor characteristics and patient presentation in ID thyroid cancer may help elucidate the increasing incidence of this disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective medical record review at an academic tertiary care medical center of 31 patients with ID thyroid cancer and 207 patients with NID thyroid cancer evaluated at our institution during a 12-month period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient demographics, tumor pathology, stage, tumor size, invasion, and metastasis were recorded. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was 56.4 years for the ID group and 41.8 years for the NID group (P < .001). The ID group was 54.8% male compared with 13.5% in the NID group (P < .001). The ID group had higher stage disease compared with the NID group (P = .003). There was no difference in tumor size (P = .91), invasion (P = .76), lymph node involvement, or distant metastases (P > .99). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with ID thyroid cancer tend to be older at presentation, have higher stage disease, and are more likely to be male compared with patients with NID thyroid cancer. There does not appear to be a significant difference in the size, pathology, or behavior of the tumor at presentation between ID and NID thyroid cancers.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether families with exceptional longevity are protected against cognitive impairment consistent with Alzheimer disease. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: Multisite study in New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1870 individuals (1510 family members and 360 spouse controls) recruited through the Long Life Family Study. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Prevalence of cognitive impairment based on a diagnostic algorithm validated using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data set. RESULTS: The cognitive algorithm classified 546 individuals (38.5%) as having cognitive impairment consistent with Alzheimer disease. Long Life Family Study probands had a slightly but not statistically significant reduced risk of cognitive impairment compared with spouse controls (121 of 232 for probands vs 45 of 103 for spouse controls; odds ratio = 0.7; 95% CI, 0.4-1.4), whereas Long Life Family Study sons and daughters had a clearly reduced risk of cognitive impairment (11 of 213 for sons and daughters vs 28 of 216 for spouse controls; odds ratio = 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9). Restriction to nieces and nephews in the offspring generation attenuated this effect (37 of 328 for nieces and nephews vs 28 of 216 for spouse controls; odds ratio = 0.8; 95% CI, 0.4-1.4). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Rates of cognitive impairment characteristic of Alzheimer disease were relatively high. In the proband generation, rates were comparable across family members and spouse controls, whereas sons and daughters of probands had significantly lower rates than spouse controls. Results suggest a delayed onset of cognitive impairment in families with exceptional longevity, but assessment of age-specific incidence rates is required to confirm this hypothesis.","Adult Children Aged Aged, 80 and over Alzheimer Disease/*epidemiology/genetics/*physiopathology Cognition Disorders/*epidemiology/genetics/*physiopathology Cross-Sectional Studies Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Longevity/*physiology Male Massachusetts/epidemiology New York/epidemiology Pennsylvania/epidemiology Prevalence Risk"

Few prospective studies have examined the association of added sugar intake with CVD mortality. OBJECTIVE To examine time trends of added sugar consumption as percentage of daily calories in the United States and investigate the association of this consumption with CVD mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 1988-1994 [III], 1999-2004, and 2005-2010 [n = 31,147]) for the time trend analysis and NHANES III Linked Mortality cohort (1988-2006 [n = 11 733]), a prospective cohort of a nationally representative sample of US adults for the association study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cardiovascular disease mortality. RESULTS Among US adults, the adjusted mean percentage of daily calories from added sugar increased from 15.7% (95% CI, 15.0%-16.4%) in 1988-1994 to 16.8% (16.0%-17.7%; P = .02) in 1999-2004 and decreased to 14.9% (14.2%-15.5%; P < .001) in 2005-2010. Most adults consumed 10% or more of calories from added sugar (71.4%) and approximately 10% consumed 25% or more in 2005-2010. During a median follow-up period of 14.6 years, we documented 831 CVD deaths during 163,039 person-years. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of CVD mortality across quintiles of the percentage of daily calories consumed from added sugar were 1.00 (reference), 1.09 (95% CI, 1.05-1.13), 1.23 (1.12-1.34), 1.49 (1.24-1.78), and 2.43 (1.63-3.62; P < .001), respectively. After additional adjustment for sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics, HRs were 1.00 (reference), 1.07 (1.02-1.12), 1.18 (1.06-1.31), 1.38 (1.11-1.70), and 2.03 (1.26-3.27; P = .004), respectively.

OBJECTIVES To review the authors' experience with corrective nasal surgery in pediatric patients and make recommendations regarding indications for surgery and surgical techniques. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective medical chart review was performed for all male patients younger than 16 years and female patients younger than 14 years seen by the senior author (F.G.F.) at a tertiary referral center between August 1996 and August 2012. The database was searched for patients who underwent septoplasty or corrective nasal surgery by the senior author. EXPOSURES Patients included in the study underwent either septoplasty or corrective nasal surgery by the senior author. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age, indication for surgery, surgery performed, and last follow-up appointment was recorded for each patient. In addition, any complications or need for revision surgical or adjunct procedures were noted. RESULTS Demographics and outcomes for 54 pediatric patients were included in the study. The most common indications for surgery were posttraumatic deformities (n = 36) and severe airway obstruction (n = 48). Fifteen patients with severe nasal airway obstruction did not have a documented history of trauma. The mean follow-up period was 646 days (approximately 21 months), with a range of 8 to 4062 days. Five patients underwent a staged procedure, and no patients underwent a revision procedure for unsatisfactory results.

METHODS: Using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, we identified 137 274 women ages 66 to 100 years who had not had breast cancer and assessed the cost to fee-for-service Medicare of breast cancer screening and workup during 2006 to 2007. For women who developed cancer, we calculated initial treatment cost. We then assessed screening-related cost at the Hospital Referral Region (HRR) level and evaluated the association between regional expenditures and workup test utilization, cancer incidence, and treatment costs. RESULTS: In the United States, the annual costs to fee-for-service Medicare for breast cancer screening-related procedures (comprising screening plus workup) and treatment expenditures were $1.08 billion and $1.36 billion, respectively. For women 75 years or older, annual screening-related expenditures exceeded $410 million. Age-standardized screening-related cost per beneficiary varied more than 2-fold across regions (from $42 to $107 per beneficiary); digital screening mammography and CAD accounted for 65% of the difference in screening-related cost between HRRs in the highest and lowest quartiles of cost. Women residing in HRRs with high screening costs were more likely to be diagnosed as having early-stage cancer (incidence rate ratio, 1.78 [95% CI, 1.40-2.26]). There was no significant difference in the cost of initial cancer treatment per beneficiary between the highest and lowest screening cost HRRs ($151 vs $115; P = .20). CONCLUSIONS: The cost to Medicare of breast cancer screening exceeds $1 billion annually in the fee-for-service program. Regional variation is substantial and driven by the use of newer and more expensive technologies; it is unclear whether higher screening expenditures are achieving better breast cancer outcomes.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis/economics/epidemiology/therapy Fee-for-Service Plans/economics Female Humans Incidence Mass Screening/*economics Medicare/*economics United States/epidemiology"

24285382,"National trends in the mental health care of children, adolescents, and adults by office-based physicians.",JAMA Psychiatry,Olfson M and Blanco C and Wang S and Laje G and Correll CU,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Despite evidence of the increasing use of psychotropic medications, little is known about the broader changes in the delivery of outpatient mental health treatment to children, adolescents, and adults. OBJECTIVE: To assess national trends and patterns in the mental health care of children, adolescents, and adults in office-based medical practice. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Outpatient visits to physicians in office-based practice from the 1995-2010 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (N = 446 542). Trends (1995-2010) in visits with mental health care indicators are first compared between youths (<21 years) and adults (>/=21 years) and then between children (0-13 years) and adolescents (14-20 years). Background and clinical characteristics of recent visits (2007-2010) resulting in a mental disorder diagnosis are also compared among children, adolescents, and adults. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Visits resulting in mental disorder diagnoses, prescription of psychotropic medications, provision of psychotherapy, or psychiatrist care. RESULTS: Between 1995-1998 and 2007-2010, visits resulting in mental disorder diagnoses per 100 population increased significantly faster for youths (from 7.78 to 15.30 visits) than for adults (from 23.23 to 28.48 visits) (interaction: P < .001). Psychiatrist visits also increased significantly faster for youths (from 2.86 to 5.71 visits) than for adults (from 10.22 to 10.87 visits) (interaction: P < .001). Psychotropic medication visits increased at comparable rates for youths (from 8.35 to 17.12 visits) and adults (from 30.76 to 65.90 visits) (interaction: P = .13). While psychotherapy visits increased from 2.25 to 3.17 per 100 population for youths, they decreased from 8.37 to 6.36 for adults (interaction: P < .001). In 2007-2010, 27.4% of child visits, 47.9% of adolescent visits, and 36.6% of adult visits resulting in a mental disorder diagnosis were to a psychiatrist. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with adult mental health care, the mental health care of young people has increased more rapidly and has coincided with increased psychotropic medication use. A great majority of mental health care in office-based medical practice to children, adolescents, and adults is provided by nonpsychiatrist physicians calling for increased consultation and communication between specialties.","Adolescent Adult Ambulatory Care/trends Child Child, Preschool Female Health Care Surveys/trends Humans Infant Male Mental Disorders/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology Mental Health Services/*trends Physician's Practice Patterns Psychotropic Drugs/therapeutic use United States/epidemiology Young Adult"

Diet-derived long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are incorporated in brain lipids and modulate oxidative and inflammatory processes and could thus affect ALS risk and progression. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between omega-6 and omega-3 PUFA consumption and ALS risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal analyses based on 1 002 082 participants (479 114 women and 522 968 men) in 5 prospective cohorts: the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study, the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, the Multiethnic Cohort Study, and the Nurses' Health Study. Diet was assessed via food frequency questionnaire developed or modified for each cohort. Participants were categorized into cohort-specific quintiles of intake of energy-adjusted dietary variables. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cohort-specific multivariable-adjusted risk ratios (RRs) of ALS incidence or death estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression and pooled using random-effects methods. RESULTS: A total of 995 ALS cases were documented during the follow-up. A greater omega-3 PUFA intake was associated with a reduced risk for ALS. The pooled, multivariable-adjusted RR for the highest to the lowest quintile was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.53-0.81; P < .001 for trend). Consumption of both alpha-linolenic acid (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.89; P = .003 for trend) and marine omega-3 PUFAs (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65-1.08; P = .03 for trend) contributed to this inverse association. Intakes of omega-6 PUFA were not associated with ALS risk. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Consumption of foods high in omega-3 PUFAs may help prevent or delay the onset of ALS.",Missing

OBJECTIVE: To compare the degree of pain experienced by children undergoing flexible nasendoscopy after 1 of 3 intranasal sprays: placebo, decongestant with topical local anesthetic (TLA), or decongestant without TLA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized placebo-controlled trial with blinding of participants, caregivers, observers, and otolaryngologists was conducted in a tertiary pediatric otolaryngology ambulatory clinic. Participants included a consecutive sample of children aged 3 to 12 years requiring flexible nasendoscopy. Exclusion criteria included concomitant respiratory tract infection, known allergy to a trial agent, or previous flexible nasendoscopy. One hundred fifty-one children were assessed for eligibility; 24 eligible children refused participation and 69 were included and block-randomized. All completed the study, and there were no adverse events. INTERVENTIONS: Nasal spray administration of placebo (normal saline); xylometazoline hydrochloride, 0.05% (decongestant); or lidocaine hydrochloride, 1%, with xylometazoline hydrochloride, 0.05% (TLA with decongestant) was performed 10 minutes before flexible nasendoscopy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was the child-reported Wong-Baker Faces Pain (WBFP) scale. Secondary outcomes included the caregiver-proxy WBFP scale; the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale; and the physician-reported Difficulty of Procedure Visual Analog Scale (DPVAS). RESULTS: Twenty-three children were recruited in each of the intervention arms. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. The mean child-rated WBFP scale scores were 2.4, 1.8, and 2.2 for the placebo, decongestant, and TLA with decongestant groups, respectively (P = .45). Although the finding was statistically nonsignificant, decongestant had the lowest mean caregiver-proxy WBFP scale score, lowest observer-rated FLACC scale score, and highest physician-rated DPVAS score. Subgroup analysis did not demonstrate any correlation between the outcomes and age or sex. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study revealed no statistically significant difference in the discomfort experienced by children undergoing flexible nasendoscopy after placebo, decongestant, or TLA with decongestant. Decongestant was associated with the least discomfort (on child, caregiver, and observer-rated pain scale scores) and the lowest rating for difficulty of procedure. With these findings, the study suggests that there is no significant benefit of topical decongestant with or without TLA compared with placebo in reducing pain associated with pediatric flexible nasendoscopy.

23558401,Predicting disease progression after regional therapy for in-transit melanoma.,JAMA Surg,Lidsky ME and Turley RS and Beasley GM and Sharma K and Tyler DS,duke,"IMPORTANCE: Although approximately 30% to 50% of patients experience a complete response after regional chemotherapy for in-transit melanoma, a subset of patients will develop rapidly progressive disease. In the current era of an expanding armamentarium, including both regional and systemic options for treating advanced melanoma, identifying perioperative factors that predict disease progression may obviate unnecessary morbidity associated with regional therapy and avoid delays in systemic therapy. OBJECTIVE: To identify patient-related clinical and pathological variables, as well as procedural factors, that correlate with disease progression. DESIGN: Using a prospectively maintained database, we identified patients who either underwent first-time melphalan-based isolated limb infusion (ILI) or first-time hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion (HILP) for in-transit melanoma. Response was defined using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors for cutaneous disease at 3 months after treatment. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, with the differences in survival curves compared using a log-rank test. Potential preoperative and procedural predictors of in-field progressive disease were analyzed using logistic regression. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 258 patients included in the database, 215 were identified as having undergone first-time regional therapy. Of these 215 patients, 134 underwent ILI, and 81 underwent HILP. EXPOSURE: Regional therapy (ILI or HILP). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Complete response or progressive disease. RESULTS: Of 134 patients who underwent ILI, 43 (32.1%) experienced in-field progressive disease. Of 81 patients who underwent HILP, 9 (11.1%) experienced in-field progressive disease. The median survival for patients with in-field progressive disease was 20.3 months for the ILI cohort and 15.0 months for the HILP cohort. In general, patients with progressive disease were younger, with advanced-stage melanoma and increased tumor burden. Compared with patients who experienced a complete response, patients with in-field progressive disease after ILI were younger (odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.90-0.98]; P = .002). For patients who underwent HILP, no clinically relevant preoperative predictors of in-field progressive disease were identified. Procedural variables, including chemotherapeutic dosing, degree of acidosis or base deficit achieved, and peak temperature attained, were not predictors of in-field progressive disease after ILI or HILP. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patient, clinical, and procedural factors are unreliable predictors of in-field progressive disease after regional therapy in patients with in-transit melanoma. Defining the potential utility of molecular markers in predicting response or failure of regional therapy should be the focus of future research efforts.","Aged Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage *Chemotherapy, Cancer, Regional Perfusion/methods Disease Progression Female Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Melanoma/*drug therapy/mortality Melphalan/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics Middle Aged Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality Treatment Outcome"
23588999,Five-year downstream outcomes following prostate-specific antigen screening in older men.,JAMA Intern Med,Walter LC and Fung KZ and Kirby KA and Shi Y and Espaldon R and O'Brien S and Freedland SJ and Powell AA and Hoffman RM,ucsf,"IMPORTANCE: Despite ongoing controversies surrounding prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, many men 65 years or older undergo screening. However, few data exist that quantify the chain of events following screening in clinical practice to better inform decisions. OBJECTIVE: To quantify 5-year downstream outcomes following a PSA screening result exceeding 4.0 ng/mL in older men. DESIGN AND SETTING: Longitudinal cohort study in the national Veterans Affairs health care system. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 295,645 men 65 years or older who underwent PSA screening in the Veterans Affairs health care system in 2003 and were followed up for 5 years using national Veterans Affairs and Medicare data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Among men whose index screening PSA level exceeded 4.0 ng/mL, we determined the number who underwent prostate biopsy, were diagnosed as having prostate cancer, were treated for prostate cancer, and were treated for prostate cancer and were alive at 5 years according to baseline characteristics. Biopsy and treatment complications were also assessed. RESULTS: In total, 25,208 men (8.5%) had an index PSA level exceeding 4.0 ng/mL. During the 5-year follow-up period, 8313 men (33.0%) underwent at least 1 prostate biopsy, and 5220 men (62.8%) who underwent prostate biopsy were diagnosed as having prostate cancer, of whom 4284 (82.1%) were treated for prostate cancer. Performance of prostate biopsy decreased with advancing age and worsening comorbidity (P < .001), whereas the percentage treated for biopsy-detected cancer exceeded 75% even among men 85 years or older, those with a Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index of 3 or higher, and those having low-risk cancer. Among men with biopsy-detected cancer, the risk of death from non-prostate cancer causes increased with advancing age and worsening comorbidity (P < .001). In total, 468 men (5.6%) had complications within 7 days after prostate biopsy. Complications of prostate cancer treatment included new urinary incontinence in 584 men (13.6%) and new erectile dysfunction 588 men (13.7%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Performance of prostate biopsy is uncommon in older men with abnormal screening PSA levels and decreases with advancing age and worsening comorbidity. However, once cancer is detected on biopsy, most men undergo immediate treatment regardless of advancing age, worsening comorbidity, or low-risk cancer. Understanding downstream outcomes in clinical practice should better inform individualized decisions among older men considering PSA screening.","Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Biopsy Comorbidity Decision Making Early Detection of Cancer/*adverse effects/methods/standards Erectile Dysfunction/epidemiology/etiology False Positive Reactions Humans Individualized Medicine Longitudinal Studies Male Mass Screening Medical Record Linkage Medicare Prostate-Specific Antigen/*blood Prostatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/immunology/prevention & control/*therapy Risk Assessment Risk Factors Survival Analysis Tumor Markers, Biological/*blood United States/epidemiology United States Department of Veterans Affairs Unnecessary Procedures Urinary Incontinence/epidemiology/etiology"
24322269,Drug labeling and exposure in neonates.,JAMA Pediatr,Laughon MM and Avant D and Tripathi N and Hornik CP and Cohen-Wolkowiez M and Clark RH and Smith PB and Rodriguez W,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Federal legislation has led to a notable increase in pediatric studies submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), resulting in new pediatric information in product labeling. However, approximately 50% of drug labels still have insufficient information on safety, efficacy, or dosing in children. Neonatal information in labeling is even scarcer because neonates comprise a vulnerable subpopulation for which end-point development is lagging and studies are more challenging. OBJECTIVE: To quantify progress made in neonatal studies and neonatal information in product labeling as a result of recent legislation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We identified a cohort of drug studies between 1997 and 2010 that included neonates as a result of pediatric legislation using information available on the FDA website. We determined what studies were published in the medical literature, the legislation responsible for the studies, and the resulting neonatal labeling changes. We then examined the use of these drugs in a cohort of neonates admitted to 290 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) (the Pediatrix Data Warehouse) in the United States from 2005 to 2010. EXPOSURE: Infants exposed to a drug studied in neonates as identified by the FDA website. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number of drug studies with neonates and rate of exposure per 1000 admissions among infants admitted to an NICU. RESULTS: In a review of the FDA databases, we identified 28 drugs studied in neonates and 24 related labeling changes. Forty-one studies encompassed the 28 drugs, and 31 (76%) of these were published. Eleven (46%) of the 24 neonatal labeling changes established safety and effectiveness. In a review of a cohort of 446,335 hospitalized infants, we identified 399 drugs used and 1,525,739 drug exposures in the first 28 postnatal days. Thirteen (46%) of the 28 drugs studied in neonates were not used in NICUs; 8 (29%) were used in fewer than 60 neonates. Of the drugs studied, ranitidine was used most often (15,627 neonates, 35 exposures per 1000 admissions). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Few drug labeling changes made under pediatric legislation include neonates. Most drugs studied are either not used or rarely used in US NICUs. Strategies to increase the study of safe and effective drugs for neonates are needed.","Drug Labeling/legislation & jurisprudence/*statistics & numerical data Humans Infant, Newborn Infant, Newborn, Diseases/*drug therapy Intensive Care Units, Neonatal *Pediatrics United States/epidemiology United States Food and Drug Administration"

It remains unclear if the 2003 regulations improved trainee well-being or patient safety. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of the 2011 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education duty hour regulations compared with the 2003 regulations concerning sleep duration, trainee education, continuity of patient care, and perceived quality of care among internal medicine trainees. DESIGN AND SETTING: Crossover study design in an academic research setting. PARTICIPANTS: Medical house staff. INTERVENTION: General medical teams were randomly assigned using a sealed-envelope draw to an experimental model or a control model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We randomly assigned 4 medical house staff teams (43 interns) using a 3-month crossover design to a 2003-compliant model of every fourth night overnight call (control) with 30-hour duty limits or to one of two 2011-compliant models of every fifth night overnight call (Q5) or a night float schedule (NF), both with 16-hour duty limits. We measured sleep duration using actigraphy and used admission volumes, educational opportunities, the number of handoffs, and satisfaction surveys to assess trainee education, continuity of patient care, and perceived quality of care. RESULTS The study included 560 control, 420 Q5, and 140 NF days that interns worked and 834 hospital admissions. Compared with controls, interns on NF slept longer during the on call period (mean, 5.1 vs 8.3 hours; P = .003), and interns on Q5 slept longer during the postcall period (mean, 7.5 vs 10.2 hours; P = .05). However, both the Q5 and NF models increased handoffs, decreased availability for teaching conferences, and reduced intern presence during daytime work hours. Residents and nurses in both experimental models perceived reduced quality of care, so much so with NF that it was terminated early.

It remains uncertain what values of arterial oxygen saturations achieve this balance in preterm infants. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of targeting lower or higher arterial oxygen saturations on the rate of death or disability in extremely preterm infants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind trial in 25 hospitals in Canada, the United States, Argentina, Finland, Germany, and Israel in which 1201 infants with gestational ages of 23 weeks 0 days through 27 weeks 6 days were enrolled within 24 hours after birth between December 2006 and August 2010. Follow-up assessments began in October 2008 and ended in August 2012. INTERVENTIONS: Study participants were monitored until postmenstrual ages of 36 to 40 weeks with pulse oximeters that displayed saturations of either 3% above or below the true values. Caregivers adjusted the concentration of oxygen to achieve saturations between 88% and 92%, which produced 2 treatment groups with true target saturations of 85% to 89% (n = 602) or 91% to 95% (n = 599). Alarms were triggered when displayed saturations decreased to 86% or increased to 94%. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of death, gross motor disability, cognitive or language delay, severe hearing loss, or bilateral blindness at a corrected age of 18 months. Secondary outcomes included retinopathy of prematurity and brain injury. RESULTS: Of the 578 infants with adequate data for the primary outcome who were assigned to the lower target range, 298 (51.6%) died or survived with disability compared with 283 of the 569 infants (49.7%) assigned to the higher target range (odds ratio adjusted for center, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.37; P = .52). The rates of death were 16.6% for those in the 85% to 89% group and 15.3% for those in the 91% to 95% group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.54; P = .54). Targeting lower saturations reduced the postmenstrual age at last use of oxygen therapy (adjusted mean difference, -0.8 weeks; 95% CI, -1.5 to -0.1; P = .03) but did not alter any other outcomes. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In extremely preterm infants, targeting oxygen saturations of 85% to 89% compared with 91% to 95% had no significant effect on the rate of death or disability at 18 months. These results may help determine the optimal target oxygen saturation.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a perioperative, cardiac output-guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: OPTIMISE was a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded trial of 734 high-risk patients aged 50 years or older undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery at 17 acute care hospitals in the United Kingdom. An updated systematic review and meta-analysis were also conducted including randomized trials published from 1966 to February 2014. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to a cardiac output-guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm for intravenous fluid and inotrope (dopexamine) infusion during and 6 hours following surgery (n=368) or to usual care (n=366). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of predefined 30-day moderate or major complications and mortality. Secondary outcomes were morbidity on day 7; infection, critical care-free days, and all-cause mortality at 30 days; all-cause mortality at 180 days; and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Baseline patient characteristics, clinical care, and volumes of intravenous fluid were similar between groups. Care was nonadherent to the allocated treatment for less than 10% of patients in each group. The primary outcome occurred in 36.6% of intervention and 43.4% of usual care participants (relative risk [RR], 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71-1.01]; absolute risk reduction, 6.8% [95% CI, -0.3% to 13.9%]; P = .07). There was no significant difference between groups for any secondary outcomes. Five intervention patients (1.4%) experienced cardiovascular serious adverse events within 24 hours compared with none in the usual care group. Findings of the meta-analysis of 38 trials, including data from this study, suggest that the intervention is associated with fewer complications (intervention, 488/1548 [31.5%] vs control, 614/1476 [41.6%]; RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.71-0.83]) and a nonsignificant reduction in hospital, 28-day, or 30-day mortality (intervention, 159/3215 deaths [4.9%] vs control, 206/3160 deaths [6.5%]; RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.67-1.01]) and mortality at longest follow-up (intervention, 267/3215 deaths [8.3%] vs control, 327/3160 deaths [10.3%]; RR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.74-1.00]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a randomized trial of high-risk patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery, use of a cardiac output-guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm compared with usual care did not reduce a composite outcome of complications and 30-day mortality. However, inclusion of these data in an updated meta-analysis indicates that the intervention was associated with a reduction in complication rates.

PrEP could reduce periconception HIV risk, but the effect on pregnancy outcomes is not well defined. OBJECTIVE: To assess pregnancy incidence and outcomes among women using PrEP during the periconception period. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized trial among 1785 HIV-serodiscordant heterosexual couples (the Partners PrEP Study) in which the female partner was HIV uninfected that demonstrated that PrEP was efficacious for HIV prevention, conducted between July 2008 and June 2013 at 9 sites in Kenya and Uganda. INTERVENTIONS: Daily oral TDF (n = 598), combination FTC+TDF (n = 566), or placebo (n = 621) through July 2011, when PrEP demonstrated efficacy for HIV prevention. Thereafter, participants continued receiving active PrEP without placebo. Pregnancy testing occurred monthly and study medication was discontinued when pregnancy was detected. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pregnancy incidence, birth outcomes (live births, pregnancy loss, preterm birth, congenital anomalies), and infant growth. RESULTS: A total of 431 pregnancies occurred. Pregnancy incidence was 10.0 per 100 person-years among women assigned placebo, 11.9 among those assigned TDF (incidence difference, 1.9; 95% CI, -1.1 to 4.9 [P = .22 vs placebo]), and 8.8 among those assigned FTC+TDF (incidence difference, -1.3; 95% CI, -4.1 to 1.5 [P = .39 vs placebo]). Before discontinuation of the placebo treatment group in July 2011, the occurrence of pregnancy loss (96 of 288 pregnancies) was 42.5% for women receiving FTC+TDF compared with 32.3% for those receiving placebo (difference for FTC+TDF vs placebo, 10.2%; 95% CI, -5.3% to 25.7%; P = .16) and was 27.7% for those receiving TDF alone (difference vs placebo, -4.6%; 95% CI, -18.1% to 8.9%; P = .46). After July 2011, the frequency of pregnancy loss (52 of 143 pregnancies) was 37.5% for FTC+TDF and 36.7% for TDF alone (difference, 0.8%; 95% CI, -16.8% to 18.5%; P = .92). Occurrence of preterm birth, congenital anomalies, and growth throughout the first year of life did not differ significantly for infants born to women who received PrEP vs placebo. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among HIV-serodiscordant heterosexual African couples, differences in pregnancy incidence, birth outcomes, and infant growth were not statistically different for women receiving PrEP with TDF alone or combination FTC+TDF compared with placebo at conception. Given that PrEP was discontinued when pregnancy was detected and that CIs for the birth outcomes were wide, definitive statements about the safety of PrEP in the periconception period cannot be made. These results should be discussed with HIV-uninfected women receiving PrEP who are considering becoming pregnant.

Medications are considerably underused. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits and harms of medications (US FDA-approved and others) for adults with alcohol use disorders. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, FDA website, and clinical trials registries (January 1, 1970, to March 1, 2014). STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers selected randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with at least 12 weeks' duration that reported eligible outcomes and head-to-head prospective cohort studies reporting health outcomes or harms. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models and calculated numbers needed to treat for benefit (NNTs) or harm (NNHs). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Alcohol consumption, motor vehicle crashes, injuries, quality of life, function, mortality, and harms. RESULTS: We included 122 RCTs and 1 cohort study (total 22,803 participants). Most assessed acamprosate (27 studies, n = 7519), naltrexone (53 studies, n = 9140), or both. The NNT to prevent return to any drinking for acamprosate was 12 (95% CI, 8 to 26; risk difference [RD], -0.09; 95% CI, -0.14 to -0.04) and was 20 (95% CI, 11 to 500; RD, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.002) for oral naltrexone (50 mg/d). The NNT to prevent return to heavy drinking was 12 (95% CI, 8 to 26; RD -0.09; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.04) for oral naltrexone (50 mg/d). Meta-analyses of trials comparing acamprosate to naltrexone found no statistically significant difference between them for return to any drinking (RD, 0.02; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.08) or heavy drinking (RD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.06). For injectable naltrexone, meta-analyses found no association with return to any drinking (RD, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.10 to 0.03) or heavy drinking (RD, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.14 to 0.13) but found an association with reduction in heavy drinking days (weighted mean difference [WMD], -4.6%; 95% CI, -8.5% to -0.56%). Among medications used off-label, moderate evidence supports an association with improvement in some consumption outcomes for nalmefene (heavy drinking days per month: WMD, -2.0; 95% CI, -3.0 to -1.0; drinks per drinking day: WMD, -1.02; 95% CI, -1.77 to -0.28) and topiramate (% heavy drinking days: WMD, -9.0%; 95% CI, -15.3% to -2.7%; drinks per drinking day: WMD, -1.0; 95% CI, -1.6 to -0.48). For naltrexone and nalmefene, NNHs for withdrawal from trials due to adverse events were 48 (95% CI, 30 to 112) and 12 (95% CI, 7 to 50), respectively; risk was not significantly increased for acamprosate or topiramate. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Both acamprosate and oral naltrexone were associated with reduction in return to drinking. When directly compared with one another, no significant differences were found between acamprosate and naltrexone for controlling alcohol consumption.

Some studies suggest that lorazepam may be more effective or safer than diazepam, but lorazepam is not Food and Drug Administration approved for this indication. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that lorazepam has better efficacy and safety than diazepam for treating pediatric status epilepticus. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted from March 1, 2008, to March 14, 2012. Patients aged 3 months to younger than 18 years with convulsive status epilepticus presenting to 1 of 11 US academic pediatric emergency departments were eligible. There were 273 patients; 140 randomized to diazepam and 133 to lorazepam. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either 0.2 mg/kg of diazepam or 0.1 mg/kg of lorazepam intravenously, with half this dose repeated at 5 minutes if necessary. If status epilepticus continued at 12 minutes, fosphenytoin was administered. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcome was cessation of status epilepticus by 10 minutes without recurrence within 30 minutes. The primary safety outcome was the performance of assisted ventilation. Secondary outcomes included rates of seizure recurrence and sedation and times to cessation of status epilepticus and return to baseline mental status. Outcomes were measured 4 hours after study medication administration. RESULTS: Cessation of status epilepticus for 10 minutes without recurrence within 30 minutes occurred in 101 of 140 (72.1%) in the diazepam group and 97 of 133 (72.9%) in the lorazepam group, with an absolute efficacy difference of 0.8% (95% CI, -11.4% to 9.8%). Twenty-six patients in each group required assisted ventilation (16.0% given diazepam and 17.6% given lorazepam; absolute risk difference, 1.6%; 95% CI, -9.9% to 6.8%). There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes except that lorazepam patients were more likely to be sedated (66.9% vs 50%, respectively; absolute risk difference, 16.9%; 95% CI, 6.1% to 27.7%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among pediatric patients with convulsive status epilepticus, treatment with lorazepam did not result in improved efficacy or safety compared with diazepam. These findings do not support the preferential use of lorazepam for this condition.

Some recent research has suggested an increased risk for speech and learning problems among children with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether increased risk for speech and learning problems exists among children with AA. DESIGN Retrospective medical record review. SETTING Multidisciplinary craniofacial clinic. PARTICIPANTS Children with unilateral or bilateral AA. INTERVENTIONS Records review, including evaluations by audiologists, speech pathologists, and psychologists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Rates of speech and/or language delay, prevalence of speech therapy and educational interventions, and parental report of psychosocial problems. RESULTS A total of 74 patients were identified who met inclusion and exclusion criteria: 48 with right-sided AA, 19 with left-sided AA, and 7 with bilateral AA. Children with AA demonstrated high rates of speech therapy (86% among bilateral, 43% among unilateral). Reports of school problems were more common among children with right-sided AA (31%) than those with left-sided AA (11%) or bilateral AA (0%) (P = .06). Educational interventions were common in all groups (33% right, 21% left, 43% bilateral). In the case of bilateral AA, all children who received additional interventions were enrolled in schools for the hearing impaired, without any identified learning deficiencies. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children with unilateral AA may be at greater risk of speech and learning difficulties than previously appreciated, similar to children with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Whether amplification may alleviate this risk is unclear and warrants further study.",Missing
24554059,Factors associated with the disposition of severely injured patients initially seen at non-trauma center emergency departments: disparities by insurance status.,JAMA Surg,Delgado MK and Yokell MA and Staudenmayer KL and Spain DA and Hernandez-Boussard T and Wang NE,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Trauma is the leading cause of potential years of life lost before age 65 years in the United States. Timely care in a designated trauma center has been shown to reduce mortality by 25%. However, many severely injured patients are not transferred to trauma centers after initially being seen at non-trauma center emergency departments (EDs). OBJECTIVES: To determine patient-level and hospital-level factors associated with the decision to admit rather than transfer severely injured patients who are initially seen at non-trauma center EDs and to ascertain whether insured patients are more likely to be admitted than transferred compared with uninsured patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis of the 2009 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. We included all ED encounters for major trauma (Injury Severity Score, >15) seen at non-trauma centers in patients aged 18 to 64 years. We excluded ED discharges and ED deaths. We quantified the absolute risk difference between admission vs transfer by insurance status, while adjusting for age, sex, mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score, weekend admission and month of visit, and urban vs rural status and median household income of the home zip code, as well as annual ED visit volume and teaching status and US region. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Inpatient admission vs transfer to another acute care facility. RESULTS: In 2009, a total of 4513 observations from 636 non-trauma center EDs were available for analysis, representing a nationally weighted population of 19,312 non-trauma center ED encounters for major trauma. Overall, 54.5% in 2009 were admitted to the non-trauma center. Compared with patients without insurance, the adjusted absolute risk of admission vs transfer was 14.3% (95% CI, 9.2%-19.4%) higher for patients with Medicaid and 11.2% (95% CI, 6.9%-15.4%) higher for patients with private insurance. Other factors associated with admission vs transfer included severe abdominal injuries (risk difference, 15.9%; 95% CI, 9.4%-22.3%), urban teaching hospital vs non-teaching hospital (risk difference, 26.2%; 95% CI, 15.2%-37.2%), and annual ED visit volume (risk difference, 3.4%; 95% CI, 1.6%-5.3% higher for every additional 10,000 annual ED visits). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with severe injuries initially evaluated at non-trauma center EDs were less likely to be transferred if insured and were at risk of receiving suboptimal trauma care. Efforts in monitoring and optimizing trauma interhospital transfers and outcomes at the population level are warranted.","Adolescent Adult Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data Female Health Services Research/statistics & numerical data Healthcare Disparities/*statistics & numerical data Humans Injury Severity Score Insurance Coverage/*statistics & numerical data Male Medically Uninsured/*statistics & numerical data Middle Aged Multiple Trauma/*epidemiology/*therapy Patient Transfer/*statistics & numerical data Referral and Consultation/*statistics & numerical data Retrospective Studies Risk Adjustment Trauma Centers/*statistics & numerical data United States Young Adult"

OBJECTIVE: To inform the debate about appropriate standards, we studied the development times, clinical testing, postmarket follow-up, and safety risks for the new drugs approved by the FDA in 2008, when most provisions of current law, regulation, and policies were in effect. DESIGN: Descriptive study of the drugs classified as new molecular entities using preapproval FDA evaluation documents, agency drug information databases, prescribing information, and other primary data sources. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Comparison of drugs that received standard review and those deemed sufficiently innovative to receive expedited review with regard to clinical development and FDA review time, the size and duration of efficacy trials, safety issues, and postmarket follow-up. RESULTS: In 2008, the FDA approved 20 therapeutic drugs, 8 with expedited review and 12 with standard review. The expedited drugs took a median of 5.1 years (range, 1.6-10.6 years) of clinical development to obtain marketing approval compared with 7.5 years (range, 4.7-19.4 years) for the standard review drugs (P = .05). The expedited drugs were tested for efficacy in a median of 104 patients receiving the active drug (range, 23-599), compared with a median of 580 patients (range, 75-1207) for standard review drugs (P = .003). Nonclinical testing showed that 6 therapeutic drugs were animal carcinogens, 5 were in vitro mutagens, and 14 were animal teratogens. Other safety concerns resulted in 5 Boxed Warnings; 8 drugs required risk management plans. The FDA required 85 postmarket commitments. By 2013, 5 drugs acquired a new or expanded Boxed Warning; 26 of 85 (31%) of the postmarketing study commitments had been fulfilled, and 8 (9%) had been submitted for agency review. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For new drugs approved by the FDA in 2008, those that received expedited review were approved more rapidly than those that received standard review. However, considerably fewer patients were studied prior to approval, and many safety questions remained unanswered. By 2013, many postmarketing studies had not been completed.","Clinical Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data Drug Approval/*statistics & numerical data Drug Discovery/*statistics & numerical data Humans Product Surveillance, Postmarketing/*statistics & numerical data Time Factors United States United States Food and Drug Administration"
23407816,Attention to threats and combat-related posttraumatic stress symptoms: prospective associations and moderation by the serotonin transporter gene.,JAMA Psychiatry,Wald I and Degnan KA and Gorodetsky E and Charney DS and Fox NA and Fruchter E and Goldman D and Lubin G and Pine DS and Bar-Haim Y,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Combat places soldiers at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The excessive rates of PTSD and other adjustment disorders in soldiers returning home make it imperative to identify risk and resilience factors that could be targeted by novel therapeutic treatments. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the interplay among attention to threat, combat exposure, and other risk factors for PTSD symptoms in soldiers deployed to combat. DESIGN AND SETTING: Longitudinal prospective study of Israeli Defense Force infantry soldiers carried out in 2008 through 2010. Repeated measurements during a 1-year period included baseline and predeployment data collected in training camps and deployment data collected in the combat theater. PARTICIPANTS: Infantry soldiers (1085 men; mean age, 18.8 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postcombat PTSD symptoms. RESULTS Soldiers developed threat vigilance during combat deployment, particularly when they were exposed to high-intensity combat, as indicated by faster response times to targets appearing at the location of threat relative to neutral stimuli (P < .001). Threat-related attention bias also interacted with combat exposure to predict risk for PTSD (P < .05). Bias toward threat at recruitment (P < .001) and bias away from threat just before deployment (P < .05) predicted postcombat PTSD symptoms. Moreover, these threat-related attention associations with PTSD were moderated by genetic and environmental factors, including serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) genotype. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Combat exposure interacts with threat-related attention to place soldiers at risk for PTSD, and interactions with other risk factors account for considerable variance in PTSD vulnerability. Understanding these associations informs research on novel attention bias modification techniques and prevention of PTSD.","Adolescent *Attention Genotype Humans Israel Male Military Personnel/*psychology Neuropsychological Tests Prospective Studies Risk Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics/physiology Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*etiology/genetics/psychology War Young Adult"
24092278,Establishing a familial basis for papillary thyroid carcinoma using the Utah Population Database.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Oakley GM and Curtin K and Pimentel R and Buchmann L and Hunt J,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Determining if relatives of patients diagnosed as having papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) are at increased risk of developing the same cancer--and if so, which relatives and to what degree--would help identify those who require closer clinical attention. This could lead to earlier cancer detection and improved prognoses. OBJECTIVE: To define the familial risk of PTC using a unique population research database. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective review at a tertiary care facility using the Utah Population Database, which is linked to medical records and the Utah Cancer Registry, from 1966 through 2011. The study population comprised 4460 patients diagnosed as having PTC in Utah between 1966 and 2011 and their first- through fifth-degree relatives and spouses. These patients were compared 5:1 with matched, population-based controls. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Statistically significant increased risk of PTC in any first- through fifth-degree relatives or spouses of patients diagnosed as having this cancer. RESULTS: First-, second-, and third-degree relatives of PTC probands had a significant increased risk of developing this cancer compared with population controls. First-degree relatives of probands were at a 5.4-fold increased risk (P < 10(-15)) of being diagnosed as having this cancer themselves. Second- and third-degree relatives had a 2.2-fold (P < 10(-11)) and 1.8-fold increased risk (P < 10(-8)), respectively. Siblings of probands were at highest risk (odd ratio, 6.8; P < 10(-15)). There was no significant increased risk observed in spouses of probands. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the largest population study to date, a high risk of PTC is confirmed in first-degree relatives. Furthermore, significant increased risk extends to second- and third-degree relatives but not to spouses of probands. Translational studies are needed to better define the genetic predisposition to familial papillary thyroid cancer and for the development and implementation of optimal screening approaches.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Carcinoma/epidemiology/*genetics Child Confidence Intervals *Family Female *Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Odds Ratio *Pedigree Population Surveillance/*methods *Registries Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics Utah/epidemiology Young Adult"
24006090,Prediction of functional outcome in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis.,JAMA Psychiatry,Carrion RE and McLaughlin D and Goldberg TE and Auther AM and Olsen RH and Olvet DM and Correll CU and Cornblatt BA,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: A major public health concern associated with schizophrenia and psychotic disorders is the long-term disability that involves impaired cognition, lack of social support, and an inability to function independently in the community. A critical goal of early detection and intervention studies in psychosis is therefore to understand the factors leading to this often profound impairment. OBJECTIVE: To develop a predictive model of functional (social and role) outcome in a clinical high-risk sample for psychosis. DESIGN: Prospective, naturalistic, longitudinal 3- to 5-year follow-up study. SETTING: The Recognition and Prevention Program in New York, a research clinic located in the Zucker Hillside Hospital in New York. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred one treatment-seeking patients at clinical high risk for psychosis. Ninety-two (91%) were followed up prospectively for a mean (SD) of 3 (1.6) years. INTERVENTION: Neurocognitive and clinical assessment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome variables were social and role functioning at the last follow-up visit. RESULTS: Poor social outcome was predicted by reduced processing speed (odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% CI, 1.050-1.823; P = .02), impaired social functioning at baseline (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.258-2.732; P = .002), and total disorganized symptoms (OR, 5.06; 95% CI, 1.548-16.527; P = .007). Reduced performance on tests for verbal memory (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.169-2.594; P = .006), role functioning at baseline (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.053-1.711; P = .02), and motor disturbances (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.060-2.969; P = .03) predicted role outcome. The areas under the curve for the social and role prediction models were 0.824 (95% CI, 0.736-0.913; P < .001) and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.87; P < .001), respectively, demonstrating a high discriminative ability. In addition, poor functional outcomes were not entirely dependent on the development of psychosis, because 40.3% and 45.5% of nonconverters at clinical high risk had poor social and role outcomes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results from this study support the increasing emphasis on functional decline as a critically important outcome that parallels conversion to psychosis and suggest that both psychosis and long-term functional disability are equally important targets for prevention. Reduced neurocognitive performance, functional impairments, and nonpositive attenuated symptoms at baseline were associated with an increased risk of poor functional outcomes in our sample. Poor functional outcomes were not entirely dependent on positive symptoms and the development of psychosis, further highlighting the need for intervention at this early stage of development for those who do and do not convert to a full-blown psychotic disorder.",Adolescent Child Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Neuropsychological Tests Predictive Value of Tests Prognosis Psychotic Disorders/*diagnosis/psychology *Social Adjustment Young Adult

Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis shows strong familial aggregation and heritability, but knowledge about specific genetic risk variants is limited. OBJECTIVES: To search the genome comprehensively for genetic associations with IHPS and validate findings in 3 independent sample sets. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: During stage 1, we used reference data from the 1000 Genomes Project for imputation into a genome-wide data set of 1001 Danish surgery-confirmed samples (cases diagnosed 1987-2008) and 2371 disease-free controls. In stage 2, the 5 most significantly associated loci were tested in independent case-control sample sets from Denmark (cases diagnosed 1983-2010), Sweden (cases diagnosed 1958-2011), and the United States (cases diagnosed 1998-2005), with a total of 1663 cases and 2315 controls. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association of genetic variation with the presence of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. RESULTS: We found a new genome-wide significant locus for IHPS at chromosome 11q23.3. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with the lowest P value at the locus, rs12721025 (odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.38-1.83; P = 1.9 x 10(-10)), is located 301 bases downstream of the apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) gene and is correlated (r2 between 0.46 and 0.80) with SNPs previously found to be associated with levels of circulating cholesterol. For these SNPs, the cholesterol-lowering allele consistently was associated with increased risk of IHPS. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study identified a new genome-wide significant locus for IHPS. Characteristics of this locus suggest the possibility of an inverse relationship between levels of circulating cholesterol in neonates and IHPS risk, which warrants further investigation.","Apolipoprotein A-I/genetics Case-Control Studies Cholesterol/*blood Denmark/epidemiology Female *Genome-Wide Association Study Genotype Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Infant, Newborn, Diseases/genetics Male Odds Ratio Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Pyloric Stenosis, Hypertrophic/blood/epidemiology/*genetics Risk Sweden/epidemiology"
23778639,Amount of Hispanic youth exposure to food and beverage advertising on Spanish- and English-language television.,JAMA Pediatr,Fleming-Milici F and Harris JL and Sarda V and Schwartz MB,yale,"IMPORTANCE: Exposure to large numbers of television advertisements for foods and beverages with little or no nutritional value likely contributes to poor diet among youth. Given higher rates of obesity and overweight for Hispanic youth, it is important to understand the amount and types of food advertising they view. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the amount of food and beverage advertising viewed by Hispanic youth on Spanish- and English-language television and compare it with the amount of food and beverage advertising viewed by non-Hispanic youth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data on gross rating points that measured advertising viewed on national broadcast and cable television in 2010 using a Nielsen panel of television-viewing households of Hispanic and non-Hispanic preschoolers (2-5 years), children (6-11 years), and adolescents (12-17 years). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Food and beverage television advertisements viewed on English- and Spanish-language television by product category and television-viewing times by age and language preference. EXPOSURE Food and beverage advertising on Spanish- and English-language television. RESULTS In 2010, Hispanic preschoolers, children, and adolescents viewed, on average, 11.6 to 12.4 television food ads per day; the majority of these ads (75%-85%) appeared on English-language television. Fast food represented a higher proportion of food ads on Spanish-language television. Consistent with television-viewing patterns, Hispanic preschoolers saw more Spanish-language food advertisements than did Hispanic children and adolescents. Owing to somewhat less food advertising on Spanish-language television, Hispanic children and adolescents viewed 14% and 24% fewer food ads overall, respectively, compared with non-Hispanic youth. Spanish-language television viewing was highly concentrated among youth who primarily speak Spanish. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Both Hispanic and non-Hispanic youth view large numbers of television advertisements for nutrient-poor categories of food and beverage. Although Hispanic children and adolescents see somewhat fewer of these ads, the higher obesity rates among Hispanic youth, the greater exposure by Hispanic preschoolers, and the potential enhanced effects of targeted advertising on Hispanic youth suggest that this exposure may pose additional risks for Hispanic youth. Continued monitoring is warranted owing to food companies' stated intentions to increase marketing to Hispanics.","Adolescent Advertising as Topic/*statistics & numerical data *Beverages Child Child, Preschool *Food Hispanic Americans/*statistics & numerical data Humans Language Television/*statistics & numerical data"

However, the association of prior existing hypertension and antihypertensive medications with risk of incident psoriasis has not been assessed using prospective data. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of hypertension and antihypertensive medications with risk of psoriasis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a prospective cohort study (June 1, 1996, to June 1, 2008) of 77 728 US women from the Nurses' Health Study who provided biennially updated data on hypertension and antihypertensive medications. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Physician-diagnosed psoriasis. RESULTS: A total of 843 incident psoriasis cases were documented during 1 066 339 person-years of follow-up. Compared with normotensive women, women with a hypertension duration of 6 years or more were at a higher risk of developing psoriasis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.27; 95% CI, 1.03-1.57). In stratified analysis, the risk of psoriasis was higher among hypertensive women without medication use (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.15-1.92) and among hypertensive women with current medication use (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.10-1.55) when compared with normotensive participants without medication use.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Patients' annualized relapse rate, disability as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, and experience of adverse effects due to MMF were assessed. Results: Of the 59 patients, 1 with NMOSD who had to discontinue MMF use in the first month due to a rash was excluded. The remaining 58 patients were included in the drug-efficacy analysis. The median post-MMF annualized relapse rate was significantly lower than the pre-MMF annualized relapse rate (0.0 vs 1.5; P < .001). The Expanded Disability Status Scale scores also significantly decreased after MMF treatment (3.0 vs 2.5; P = .005). Thirty-five patients (60%) were relapse free, and Expanded Disability Status Scale scores were stabilized or improved in 53 patients (91%). Fourteen patients discontinued MMF treatment owing to ongoing relapse (10 patients), rash (1 patient), pregnancy (1 patient), and financial problems (2 patients), but MMF was generally well tolerated. Conclusions and Relevance: In this observational study, MMF treatment induced reduction of relapse frequency, stabilized or improved disability, and was well tolerated in patients with NMOSD.",Missing
25138334,Newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency in 11 screening programs in the United States.,JAMA,Kwan A and Abraham RS and Currier R and Brower A and Andruszewski K and Abbott JK and Baker M and Ballow M and Bartoshesky LE and Bonilla FA and Brokopp C and Brooks E and Caggana M and Celestin J and Church JA and Comeau AM and Connelly JA and Cowan MJ and Cunningham-Rundles C and Dasu T and Dave N and De La Morena MT and Duffner U and Fong CT and Forbes L and Freedenberg D and Gelfand EW and Hale JE and Hanson IC and Hay BN and Hu D and Infante A and Johnson D and Kapoor N and Kay DM and Kohn DB and Lee R and Lehman H and Lin Z and Lorey F and Abdel-Mageed A and Manning A and McGhee S and Moore TB and Naides SJ and Notarangelo LD and Orange JS and Pai SY and Porteus M and Rodriguez R and Romberg N and Routes J and Ruehle M and Rubenstein A and Saavedra-Matiz CA and Scott G and Scott PM and Secord E and Seroogy C and Shearer WT and Siegel S and Silvers SK and Stiehm ER and Sugerman RW and Sullivan JL and Tanksley S and Tierce ML 4th and Verbsky J and Vogel B and Walker R and Walkovich K and Walter JE and Wasserman RL and Watson MS and Weinberg GA and Weiner LB and Wood H and Yates AB and Puck JM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) using assays to detect T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) began in Wisconsin in 2008, and SCID was added to the national recommended uniform panel for newborn screened disorders in 2010. Currently 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Navajo Nation conduct population-wide newborn screening for SCID. The incidence of SCID is estimated at 1 in 100,000 births. OBJECTIVES: To present data from a spectrum of SCID newborn screening programs, establish population-based incidence for SCID and other conditions with T-cell lymphopenia, and document early institution of effective treatments. DESIGN: Epidemiological and retrospective observational study. SETTING: Representatives in states conducting SCID newborn screening were invited to submit their SCID screening algorithms, test performance data, and deidentified clinical and laboratory information regarding infants screened and cases with nonnormal results. Infants born from the start of each participating program from January 2008 through the most recent evaluable date prior to July 2013 were included. Representatives from 10 states plus the Navajo Area Indian Health Service contributed data from 3,030,083 newborns screened with a TREC test. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Infants with SCID and other diagnoses of T-cell lymphopenia were classified. Incidence and, where possible, etiologies were determined. Interventions and survival were tracked. RESULTS: Screening detected 52 cases of typical SCID, leaky SCID, and Omenn syndrome, affecting 1 in 58,000 infants (95% CI, 1/46,000-1/80,000). Survival of SCID-affected infants through their diagnosis and immune reconstitution was 87% (45/52), 92% (45/49) for infants who received transplantation, enzyme replacement, and/or gene therapy. Additional interventions for SCID and non-SCID T-cell lymphopenia included immunoglobulin infusions, preventive antibiotics, and avoidance of live vaccines. Variations in definitions and follow-up practices influenced the rates of detection of non-SCID T-cell lymphopenia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Newborn screening in 11 programs in the United States identified SCID in 1 in 58,000 infants, with high survival. The usefulness of detection of non-SCID T-cell lymphopenias by the same screening remains to be determined.","Female Humans Incidence Infant, Newborn Lymphopenia/*diagnosis Male Neonatal Screening/*methods Prognosis Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics Retrospective Studies Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy Survival Analysis T-Lymphocytes/immunology United States"
23588900,Impact of providing fee data on laboratory test ordering: a controlled clinical trial.,JAMA Intern Med,Feldman LS and Shihab HM and Thiemann D and Yeh HC and Ardolino M and Mandell S and Brotman DJ,jhmi,"IMPORTANCE: Inpatient care providers often order laboratory tests without any appreciation for the costs of the tests. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether we could decrease the number of laboratory tests ordered by presenting providers with test fees at the time of order entry in a tertiary care hospital, without adding extra steps to the ordering process. DESIGN: Controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: All providers, including physicians and nonphysicians, who ordered laboratory tests through the computerized provider order entry system at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. INTERVENTION: We randomly assigned 61 diagnostic laboratory tests to an ""active"" arm (fee displayed) or to a control arm (fee not displayed). During a 6-month baseline period (November 10, 2008, through May 9, 2009), we did not display any fee data. During a 6-month intervention period 1 year later (November 10, 2009, through May 9, 2010), we displayed fees, based on the Medicare allowable fee, for active tests only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We examined changes in the total number of orders placed, the frequency of ordered tests (per patient-day), and total charges associated with the orders according to the time period (baseline vs intervention period) and by study group (active test vs control). RESULTS: For the active arm tests, rates of test ordering were reduced from 3.72 tests per patient-day in the baseline period to 3.40 tests per patient-day in the intervention period (8.59% decrease; 95% CI, -8.99% to -8.19%). For control arm tests, ordering increased from 1.15 to 1.22 tests per patient-day from the baseline period to the intervention period (5.64% increase; 95% CI, 4.90% to 6.39%) (P < .001 for difference over time between active and control tests). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Presenting fee data to providers at the time of order entry resulted in a modest decrease in test ordering. Adoption of this intervention may reduce the number of inappropriately ordered diagnostic tests.","Adult Aged Baltimore Clinical Laboratory Techniques/*economics/statistics & numerical data Cost Control *Data Display Diagnostic Tests, Routine/*economics/statistics & numerical data *Fees and Charges Female Hospitals/*statistics & numerical data Humans Male Medicare Middle Aged Physician's Practice Patterns/*economics/statistics & numerical data Prescriptions/*economics/*statistics & numerical data United States"

OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety, tolerability, and urate-elevating capability of the urate precursor inosine in early PD and to assess its suitability and potential design features for a disease-modification trial. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Safety of Urate Elevation in PD (SURE-PD) study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial of inosine, enrolled participants from 2009 to 2011 and followed them for up to 25 months at outpatient visits to 17 credentialed clinical study sites of the Parkinson Study Group across the United States. Seventy-five consenting adults (mean age, 62 years; 55% women) with early PD not yet requiring symptomatic treatment and a serum urate concentration less than 6 mg/dL (the approximate population median) were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: placebo or inosine titrated to produce mild (6.1-7.0 mg/dL) or moderate (7.1-8.0 mg/dL) serum urate elevation using 500-mg capsules taken orally up to 2 capsules 3 times per day. They were followed for up to 24 months (median, 18 months) while receiving the study drug plus 1 washout month. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The prespecified primary outcomes were absence of unacceptable serious adverse events (safety), continued treatment without adverse event requiring dose reduction (tolerability), and elevation of urate assessed serially in serum and once (at 3 months) in cerebrospinal fluid. RESULTS Serious adverse events (17), including infrequent cardiovascular events, occurred at the same or lower rates in the inosine groups relative to placebo. No participant developed gout and 3 receiving inosine developed symptomatic urolithiasis. Treatment was tolerated by 95% of participants at 6 months, and no participant withdrew because of an adverse event. Serum urate rose by 2.3 and 3.0 mg/dL in the 2 inosine groups (P < .001 for each) vs placebo, and cerebrospinal fluid urate level was greater in both inosine groups (P = .006 and <.001, respectively). Secondary analyses demonstrated nonfutility of inosine treatment for slowing disability. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Inosine was generally safe, tolerable, and effective in raising serum and cerebrospinal fluid urate levels in early PD. The findings support advancing to more definitive development of inosine as a potential disease-modifying therapy for PD.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize the international prevalence of exposure to indoor tanning. DATA SOURCES: Studies were identified through systematic searches of PubMed (1966 to present), Scopus (1823 to present), and Web of Science (1898 to present) databases, last performed on March 16, 2013. We also hand searched reference lists to identify records missed by database searches and publicly available data not yet published in the scientific literature. STUDY SELECTION: Records reporting a prevalence of indoor tanning were eligible for inclusion. We excluded case-control studies, reports with insufficient study information, and reports of groups recruited using factors related to indoor tanning. Two independent investigators performed searches and study selection. Our search yielded 1976 unique records. After exclusions, 161 records were assessed for eligibility in full text, and 88 were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent investigators extracted data on characteristics of study participants, inclusion/exclusion criteria, data collection format, outcomes, and statistical methods. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to summarize the prevalence of indoor tanning in different age categories. We calculated the population proportional attributable risk of indoor tanning in the United States, Europe, and Australia for nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and melanoma. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Ever and past-year exposure to indoor tanning. RESULTS: The summary prevalence of ever exposure was 35.7% (95% CI, 27.5%-44.0%) for adults, 55.0% (33.0%-77.1%) for university students, and 19.3% (14.7%-24.0%) for adolescents. The summary prevalence of past-year exposure was 14.0% (95% CI, 11.5%-16.5%) for adults, 43.1% (21.7%-64.5%) for university students, and 18.3% (12.6%-24.0%) for adolescents. These results included data from 406 696 participants. The population proportional attributable risk were 3.0% to 21.8% for NMSC and 2.6% to 9.4% for melanoma, corresponding to more than 450 000 NMSC cases and more than 10 000 melanoma cases each year attributable to indoor tanning in the United States, Europe, and Australia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Exposure to indoor tanning is common in Western countries, especially among young persons. Given the large number of skin cancer cases attributable to indoor tanning, these findings highlight a major public health issue.","Australia/epidemiology Beauty Culture Canada/epidemiology Carcinoma, Basal Cell/epidemiology/etiology Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/epidemiology/etiology Cosmetic Techniques/*utilization Europe/epidemiology Humans Melanoma/epidemiology/etiology Risk Assessment Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology Sunbathing/*statistics & numerical data Suntan Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects United States/epidemiology"
23381234,Associations of early exposure to intimate partner violence and parental depression with subsequent mental health outcomes.,JAMA Pediatr,Bauer NS and Gilbert AL and Carroll AE and Downs SM,iupui,"IMPORTANCE: Children with known exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) or maternal depression are at risk for negative mental health outcomes as early as preschool age. Active ongoing surveillance for these risk factors can lead to earlier mental health intervention for children. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between parent reports of IPV and depressive symptoms within the first 3 years of a child's life with subsequent mental health conditions and psychotropic drug treatment. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study linking parental IPV and depression with subsequent billing and pharmacy data between November 1, 2004, and June 7, 2012. SETTING: Four pediatric clinics. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2422 children receiving care from clinics that implemented the Child Health Improvement Through Computer Automation (CHICA) system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Any report of IPV and/or parental depressive symptoms from birth to age 3 years, mental health diagnoses made with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision criteria, and any psychotropic drug treatment between ages 3 and 6 years. RESULTS: Fifty-eight caregivers (2.4%) reported both IPV and depressive symptoms before their children were aged 3 years, 69 (2.8%) reported IPV only, 704 (29.1%) reported depressive symptoms only, and 1591 (65.7%) reported neither exposure. Children of parents reporting both IPV and depressive symptoms were more likely to have a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adjusted odds ratio = 4.0; 95% CI, 1.5-10.9), even after adjusting for the child's sex, race/ethnicity, and insurance type. Children whose parents reported depressive symptoms were more likely to have been prescribed psychotropic medication (adjusted odds ratio = 1.9; 95%, CI 1.0-3.4). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Exposure to both IPV and depression before age 3 years is associated with preschool-aged onset of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; early exposure to parental depression is associated with being prescribed psychotropic medication. Pediatricians play a critical role in performing active, ongoing surveillance of families with these known social risk factors and providing early intervention to negate long-term sequelae.","Age Factors Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/epidemiology Child, Preschool Female Humans Logistic Models Male Parent-Child Relations Parents/*psychology Prospective Studies Psychotropic Drugs/therapeutic use Risk Factors *Spouses"

23553149,Association of maternal exposure to childhood abuse with elevated risk for autism in offspring.,JAMA Psychiatry,Roberts AL and Lyall K and Rich-Edwards JW and Ascherio A and Weisskopf MG,harvard,"IMPORTANCE: Adverse perinatal circumstances have been associated with increased risk for autism in offspring. Women exposed to childhood abuse experience more adverse perinatal circumstances than women unexposed, but whether maternal abuse is associated with autism in offspring is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether maternal exposure to childhood abuse is associated with risk for autism in offspring and whether possible increased risk is accounted for by a higher prevalence of adverse perinatal circumstances among abused women, including toxemia, low birth weight, gestational diabetes, previous induced abortion, intimate partner abuse, pregnancy length shorter than 37 weeks, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use, and alcohol use and smoking during pregnancy. DESIGN AND SETTING: Nurses' Health Study II, a population-based longitudinal cohort of 116 430 women. PARTICIPANTS: Nurses with data on maternal childhood abuse and child's autism status (97.0% were of white race/ethnicity). Controls were randomly selected from among children of women who did not report autism in offspring (participants included 451 mothers of children with autism and 52 498 mothers of children without autism). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Autism spectrum disorder in offspring, assessed by maternal report and validated with the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised in a subsample. RESULTS: Exposure to abuse was associated with increased risk for autism in children in a monotonically increasing fashion. The highest level of abuse was associated with the greatest prevalence of autism (1.8% vs 0.7% among women not abused, P = .005) and with the greatest risk for autism adjusted for demographic factors (risk ratio, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.3-5.8). All adverse perinatal circumstances except low birth weight were more prevalent among women abused in childhood. Adjusted for perinatal factors, the association of maternal childhood abuse with autism in offspring was slightly attenuated (risk ratio for highest level of abuse, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.9-4.8). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We identify an intergenerational association between maternal exposure to childhood abuse and risk for autism in the subsequent generation. Adverse perinatal circumstances accounted for only a small portion of this increased risk.",Adult Autistic Disorder/*etiology Child Child Abuse/*psychology Female Humans Longitudinal Studies Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects Mothers/*psychology Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications/*etiology Risk
24369387,Race/ethnicity and geographic access to Medicaid substance use disorder treatment facilities in the United States.,JAMA Psychiatry,Cummings JR and Wen H and Ko M and Druss BG,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Although substance use disorders (SUDs) are prevalent and associated with adverse consequences, treatment rates remain low. Unlike physical and mental health problems, treatment for SUDs is predominantly provided in a separate specialty sector and more heavily financed by public sources. Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has the potential to increase access to treatment for SUDs but only if an infrastructure exists to serve new enrollees. OBJECTIVE: To examine the availability of outpatient SUD treatment facilities that accept Medicaid across US counties and whether counties with a higher percentage of racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to have gaps in this infrastructure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data from the 2009 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services public use file and the 2011-2012 Area Resource file to examine sociodemographic factors associated with county-level access to SUD treatment facilities that serve Medicaid enrollees. Counties in all 50 states were included. We estimated a probit model with state indicators to adjust for state-level heterogeneity in demographics, politics, and policies. Independent variables assessed county racial/ethnic composition (ie, percentage black and percentage Hispanic), percentage living in poverty, percentage living in a rural area, percentage insured with Medicaid, percentage uninsured, and total population. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Dichotomous indicator for counties with at least 1 outpatient SUD treatment facility that accepts Medicaid. RESULTS: Approximately 60% of US counties have at least 1 outpatient SUD facility that accepts Medicaid, although this rate is lower in many Southern and Midwestern states than in other areas of the country. Counties with a higher percentage of black (marginal effect [ME], -3.1; 95% CI, -5.2% to -0.9%), rural (-9.2%; -11.1% to -7.4%), and/or uninsured (-9.5%; -13.0% to -5.9%) residents are less likely to have one of these facilities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The potential for increasing access to SUD treatment via Medicaid expansion may be tempered by the local availability of facilities to provide care, particularly for counties with a high percentage of black and/or uninsured residents and for rural counties. Although states that opt in to the expansion will secure additional federal funds for the SUD treatment system, additional policies may need to be implemented to ensure that adequate geographic access exists across local communities to serve new enrollees.",*Continental Population Groups/statistics & numerical data *Ethnic Groups/statistics & numerical data *Health Services Accessibility/statistics & numerical data Humans Medicaid/*statistics & numerical data Socioeconomic Factors *Substance Abuse Treatment Centers/statistics & numerical data Substance-Related Disorders/*therapy United States

To reduce the risk of relapse/recurrence after acute phase cognitive therapy (CT), a continuation phase model of therapy may improve outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To test the efficacy of continuation phase CT (C-CT) and fluoxetine for relapse prevention in a pill placebo (PBO)-controlled randomized trial and compare the durability of prophylaxis after discontinuation of treatments. DESIGN: A sequential, 3-stage design with an acute phase (all patients received 12 weeks of CT); 8-month experimental phase (responders at higher risk were randomized to C-CT, fluoxetine, or PBO); and 24 months of longitudinal, posttreatment follow-up. SETTING: Two university-based specialty clinics. PATIENTS: A total of 523 adults with recurrent major depressive disorder began acute phase CT, of which 241 higher-risk responders were randomized and 181 subsequently entered the follow-up. INTERVENTIONS: Cognitive therapy responders at higher risk for relapse were randomized to receive 8 months of C-CT (n = 86), fluoxetine (n = 86), or PBO (n = 69). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Survival analyses of relapse/recurrence rates, as determined by blinded evaluators using DSM-IV criteria and the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation. RESULTS As predicted, the C-CT or fluoxetine groups were significantly less likely to relapse than the PBO group across 8 months. Relapse/recurrence rates for C-CT and fluoxetine were nearly identical during the 8 months of treatment, although C-CT patients were more likely to accept randomization, stayed in treatment longer, and attended more sessions than those in the fluoxetine and PBO groups. Contrary to prediction, relapse/recurrence rates following the discontinuation of C-CT and fluoxetine did not differ. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Relapse risk was reduced by both C-CT and fluoxetine in an enriched randomization sampling only CT responders. The preventive effects of C-CT were not significantly more durable than those of fluoxetine after treatment was stopped, suggesting that some higher-risk patients may require alternate longer-term interventions.

23400249,Medicaid drug selection committees and inadequate management of conflicts of interest.,JAMA Intern Med,Nguyen NY and Bero L,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Drug selection decisions for state Medicaid reimbursement programs should be based on the best available evidence and free of conflicts of interest (COIs), but little is known about how the committees identify and manage COIs of the members. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the content of Medicaid drug selection committees' COI policies for the US states and the District of Colombia, (2) categorize the policies by strength, and (3) identify characteristics of a strong policy. METHODS: For all states with Medicaid Preferred Drug Lists (47 states and the District of Columbia), we conducted a systematic search of official Medicaid websites and contacted Medicaid staff by e-mail and/or telephone to identify drug selection committee COI policies. We conducted a content analysis of the policies, extracting data on COI disclosure parameters, management strategies, and review processes using predefined categories modified through an iterative process. RESULTS: Policy documents were obtained for 27 of the programs (56%)-14 from websites and 13 by contacting Medicaid officials. We found high variability in COI policies, lack of public availability, and inconsistent enforcement and management of COI among states. The most common management strategy was disclosure of COI in 67% of policies (18 of 27), followed by self-recusal in 52% of policies (14 of 27). Only 15% of policies (4 of 27) ban certain relationships with industry. CONCLUSIONS: Current policies are not transparent and not standardized, and no state policy included all model components. Wide variations suggest that some policies may not adequately protect drug selection decisions against COI and industry influence. With expected growth of Medicaid due to health care reform, the selection of drugs for Medicaid patients should be protected from the influence of COI.",Conflict of Interest/*economics Disclosure Health Care Surveys Health Policy/*economics Health Services Needs and Demand Humans *Medicaid/economics/organization & administration *Medication Therapy Management/economics/standards Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee/*organization & administration Policy Making Reimbursement Mechanisms/standards United States

To counsel people appropriately, clinicians need to know what the evidence says about the health benefits of meditation. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of meditation programs in improving stress-related outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress/distress, positive mood, mental health-related quality of life, attention, substance use, eating habits, sleep, pain, and weight) in diverse adult clinical populations. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We identified randomized clinical trials with active controls for placebo effects through November 2012 from MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, PsycArticles, Scopus, CINAHL, AMED, the Cochrane Library, and hand searches. Two independent reviewers screened citations and extracted data. We graded the strength of evidence using 4 domains (risk of bias, precision, directness, and consistency) and determined the magnitude and direction of effect by calculating the relative difference between groups in change from baseline. When possible, we conducted meta-analyses using standardized mean differences to obtain aggregate estimates of effect size with 95% confidence intervals. FINDINGS: After reviewing 18 753 citations, we included 47 trials with 3515 participants. Mindfulness meditation programs had moderate evidence of improved anxiety (effect size, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.12-0.64] at 8 weeks and 0.22 [0.02-0.43] at 3-6 months), depression (0.30 [0.00-0.59] at 8 weeks and 0.23 [0.05-0.42] at 3-6 months), and pain (0.33 [0.03- 0.62]) and low evidence of improved stress/distress and mental health-related quality of life. We found low evidence of no effect or insufficient evidence of any effect of meditation programs on positive mood, attention, substance use, eating habits, sleep, and weight. We found no evidence that meditation programs were better than any active treatment (ie, drugs, exercise, and other behavioral therapies). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Clinicians should be aware that meditation programs can result in small to moderate reductions of multiple negative dimensions of psychological stress. Thus, clinicians should be prepared to talk with their patients about the role that a meditation program could have in addressing psychological stress. Stronger study designs are needed to determine the effects of meditation programs in improving the positive dimensions of mental health and stress-related behavior.","Adult *Affect Anxiety/psychology/therapy Depression/psychology/therapy Humans Meditation/*psychology Quality of Life/*psychology Stress, Psychological/psychology/*therapy"
23613077,Does this woman have an ectopic pregnancy?: the rational clinical examination systematic review.,JAMA,Crochet JR and Bastian LA and Chireau MV,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The rapid identification and accurate diagnosis of women who may have an ectopic pregnancy is critically important for reducing the maternal morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the accuracy and precision of the patient history, clinical examination, readily available laboratory values, and sonography in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy in women with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding during early pregnancy. DATA SOURCES: We conducted MEDLINE and EMBASE searches for English-language articles from 1965 to December 2012 reporting on the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. STUDY SELECTION: The analysis included prospective studies of 100 or more pregnant women with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding that evaluated patient history, physical examination, laboratory values, and sonography compared with a reference standard of either (1) direct surgical visualization of ectopic pregnancy or (2) clinical follow-up for all pregnancies to prove that ectopic pregnancy was not missed. Of 10,890 articles identified by the search, 14 studies with 12,101 patients met the inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two authors (J.R.C. and M.V.C.) independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each study. A third author (L.A.B.) resolved any discrepancies. RESULTS: All components of the patient history had a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) less than 1.5. The presence of an adnexal mass in the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy on transvaginal sonography (LR+ 111; 95% CI, 12-1028; n = 6885), and the physical examination findings of cervical motion tenderness (LR+ 4.9; 95% CI, 1.7-14; n = 1435), an adnexal mass (LR+ 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6-3.7; n = 1378), and adnexal tenderness (LR+ 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.5; n = 1435) all increase the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy. A lack of adnexal abnormalities on transvaginal sonography (negative LR [LR-] 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03-0.55; n = 6885) decreases the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy. Existing studies do not establish a single serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level that is diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy.

Objective: To evaluate the association between midlife (48-67 years of age) hypertension and the 20-year change in cognitive performance. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort (1990-1992 through 2011-2013) underwent evaluation at field centers in Washington County, Maryland, Forsyth County, North Carolina, Jackson, Mississippi, and the Minneapolis, Minnesota, suburbs. Of 13 476 African American and white participants with baseline cognitive data, 58.0% of living participants completed the 20-year cognitive follow-up. Exposures: Hypertension, prehypertension, or normal blood pressure (BP) at visit 2 (1990-1992) constituted the primary exposure. Systolic BP at visit 2 or 5 (2011-2013) and indication for treatment at visit 2 based on the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC-8) hypertension guidelines constituted the secondary exposures. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prespecified outcomes included the 20-year change in scores on the Delayed Word Recall Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, and Word Fluency Test and in global cognition. Results: During 20 years, baseline hypertension was associated with an additional decline of 0.056 global z score points (95% CI, -0.100 to -0.012) and prehypertension was associated nonsignificantly with 0.040 more global z score points of decline (95% CI, -0.085 to 0.005) compared with normal BP. Individuals with hypertension who used antihypertensives had less decline during the 20 years than untreated individuals with hypertension (-0.050 [95% CI, -0.003 to -0.097] vs -0.079 [95% CI, -0.156 to -0.002] global z score points). Having a JNC-8-specified indication for initiating antihypertensive treatment at baseline was associated with a greater 20-year decline (-0.044 [95% CI, -0.085 to -0.003] global z score points) than not having an indication. We observed effect modification by race for the continuous systolic BP analyses (P = .01), with each 20-mm Hg increment at baseline associated with an additional decline of 0.048 (95% CI, -0.074 to -0.022) points in global cognitive z score in whites but not in African Americans (decline, -0.020 [95% CI, -0.026 to 0.066] points). Systolic BP at the end of follow-up was not associated with the preceding 20 years of cognitive change in either group. Methods to account for bias owing to attrition strengthened the magnitude of some associations. Conclusions and Relevance: Midlife hypertension and elevated midlife but not late-life systolic BP was associated with more cognitive decline during the 20 years of the study. Greater decline is found with higher midlife BP in whites than in African Americans.",Missing

23483174,Primary care vs specialist sleep center management of obstructive sleep apnea and daytime sleepiness and quality of life: a randomized trial.,JAMA,Chai-Coetzer CL and Antic NA and Rowland LS and Reed RL and Esterman A and Catcheside PG and Eckermann S and Vowles N and Williams H and Dunn S and McEvoy RD,sa,"IMPORTANCE: Due to increasing demand for sleep services, there has been growing interest in ambulatory models of care for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. With appropriate training and simplified management tools, primary care physicians are ideally positioned to take on a greater role in diagnosis and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy and within-trial costs of a simplified model of diagnosis and care in primary care relative to that in specialist sleep centers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A randomized, controlled, noninferiority study involving 155 patients with obstructive sleep apnea that was treated at primary care practices (n=81) in metropolitan Adelaide, 3 rural regions of South Australia or at a university hospital sleep medicine center in Adelaide, Australia (n = 74), between September 2008 and June 2010. INTERVENTIONS: Primary care management of obstructive sleep apnea vs usual care in a specialist sleep center; both plans included continuous positive airway pressure, mandibular advancement splints, or conservative measures only. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-month change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score, which ranges from 0 (no daytime sleepiness) to 24 points (high level of daytime sleepiness). The noninferiority margin was -2.0. Secondary outcomes included disease-specific and general quality of life measures, obstructive sleep apnea symptoms, adherence to using continuous positive airway pressure, patient satisfaction, and health care costs. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in ESS scores from baseline to 6 months in both groups. In the primary care group, the mean baseline score of 12.8 decreased to 7.0 at 6 months (P < .001), and in the specialist group, the score decreased from a mean of 12.5 to 7.0 (P < .001). Primary care management was noninferior to specialist management with a mean change in ESS score of 5.8 vs 5.4 (adjusted difference, -0.13; lower bound of 1-sided 95% CI, -1.5; P = .43). There were no differences in secondary outcome measures between groups. Seventeen patients (21%) withdrew from the study in the primary care group vs 6 patients (8%) in the specialist group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with obstructive sleep apnea, treatment under a primary care model compared with a specialist model did not result in worse sleepiness scores, suggesting that the 2 treatment modes may be comparable.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the benefits and harms of screening mammography frequencies according to age, breast density, and postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) use. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Data collected January 1994 to December 2008 from mammography facilities in community practice that participate in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) mammography registries. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected prospectively on 11,474 women with breast cancer and 922,624 without breast cancer who underwent mammography at facilities that participate in the BCSC. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We used logistic regression to calculate the odds of advanced stage (IIb, III, or IV) and large tumors (>20 mm in diameter) and 10-year cumulative probability of a false-positive mammography result by screening frequency, age, breast density, and HT use. The main predictor was screening mammography interval. RESULTS: Mammography biennially vs annually for women aged 50 to 74 years does not increase risk of tumors with advanced stage or large size regardless of women's breast density or HT use. Among women aged 40 to 49 years with extremely dense breasts, biennial mammography vs annual is associated with increased risk of advanced-stage cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.89; 95% CI, 1.06-3.39) and large tumors (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.37-4.18). Cumulative probability of a false-positive mammography result was high among women undergoing annual mammography with extremely dense breasts who were either aged 40 to 49 years (65.5%) or used estrogen plus progestogen (65.8%) and was lower among women aged 50 to 74 years who underwent biennial or triennial mammography with scattered fibroglandular densities (30.7% and 21.9%, respectively) or fatty breasts (17.4% and 12.1%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Women aged 50 to 74 years, even those with high breast density or HT use, who undergo biennial screening mammography have similar risk of advanced-stage disease and lower cumulative risk of false-positive results than those who undergo annual mammography. When deciding whether to undergo mammography, women aged 40 to 49 years who have extremely dense breasts should be informed that annual mammography may minimize their risk of advanced-stage disease but the cumulative risk of false-positive results is high.",Adult Age Factors Aged Breast/*pathology Breast Neoplasms/*pathology/*radiography Early Detection of Cancer/*methods *Estrogen Replacement Therapy False Positive Reactions Female Humans Logistic Models *Mammography/adverse effects/standards Mass Screening/*methods Middle Aged Odds Ratio Postmenopause Prospective Studies Risk Assessment Risk Factors
24452778,Positive and negative volume-outcome relationships in the geriatric trauma population.,JAMA Surg,Matsushima K and Schaefer EW and Won EJ and Armen SB and Indeck MC and Soybel DI,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: In trauma populations, improvements in outcome are documented in institutions with higher case volumes. However, it is not known whether improved outcomes are attributable to the case volume within specific higher-risk groups, such as the elderly, or to the case volume among all trauma patients treated by an institution. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that outcomes of trauma care for geriatric patients are affected differently by the volume of geriatric cases and nongeriatric cases of an institution. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study using a statewide trauma registry was set in state-designated levels 1 and 2 trauma centers in Pennsylvania. It included 39 431 eligible geriatric trauma patients (aged >65 years) in the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcomes Study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital mortality, major complications, and mortality after major complications (failure to rescue). RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2010, 39 431 geriatric trauma patients and 105 046 nongeriatric patients were captured in a review of outcomes in 20 state-designated levels 1 and 2 trauma centers. Larger volumes of geriatric trauma patients were significantly associated with lower odds of in-hospital mortality, major complications, and failure to rescue. In contrast, larger nongeriatric trauma volumes were significantly associated with higher odds of major complications in geriatric patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Higher rates of in-hospital mortality, major complications, and failure to rescue were associated with lower volumes of geriatric trauma care and paradoxically with higher volumes of trauma care for younger patients. These findings offer the possibility that outcomes might be improved with differentiated pathways of care for geriatric trauma patients.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Female *Geriatric Assessment Hospital Mortality/trends Hospitals, High-Volume/*statistics & numerical data Hospitals, Low-Volume/*statistics & numerical data Humans Injury Severity Score Male Outcome Assessment (Health Care)/*methods *Registries Retrospective Studies Trauma Centers/*statistics & numerical data United States/epidemiology Wounds and Injuries/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy"
23266529,Trends in the overuse of ambulatory health care services in the United States.,JAMA Intern Med,Kale MS and Bishop TF and Federman AD and Keyhani S,mountsinai,"BACKGROUND: Given the rising costs of health care, policymakers are increasingly interested in identifying the inefficiencies in our health care system. The objective of this study was to determine whether the overuse and misuse of health care services in the ambulatory setting has decreased in the past decade. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of the 1999 and 2009 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the outpatient department component of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, which are nationally representative annual surveys of visits to non-federally funded ambulatory care practices. We applied 22 quality indicators using a combination of current quality measures and guideline recommendations. The main outcome measures were the rates of underuse, overuse, and misuse and their 95% CIs. RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant improvement in 6 of 9 underuse quality indicators. There was an improvement in the use of antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation; the use of aspirin, beta-blockers, and statins in coronary artery disease; the use of beta-blockers in congestive heart failure; and the use of statins in diabetes mellitus. We observed an improvement in only 2 of 11 overuse quality indicators, 1 indicator became worse, and 8 did not change. There was a statistically significant decrease in the overuse of cervical cancer screening in visits for women older than 65 years and in the overuse of antibiotics in asthma exacerbations. However, there was an increase in the overuse of prostate cancer screening in men older than 74 years. Of the 2 misuse indicators, there was a decrease in the proportion of patients with a urinary tract infection who were prescribed an inappropriate antibiotic. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant improvement in the delivery of underused care but more limited changes in the reduction of inappropriate care. With the high cost of health care, these results are concerning.","Adult Ambulatory Care Facilities/statistics & numerical data/*utilization Cross-Sectional Studies Female Health Services Misuse/statistics & numerical data/*trends Humans Male Middle Aged Quality Indicators, Health Care United States"
24263465,Parental perspectives on adolescent hearing loss risk and prevention.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Sekhar DL and Clark SJ and Davis MM and Singer DC and Paul IM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Data indicate that 1 in 6 adolescents has high-frequency hearing loss, which is typically noise related and preventable. Parental participation improves the success of adolescent behavioral interventions, yet little is known about parental perspectives regarding adolescent noise-induced hearing loss. OBJECTIVE: To perform a survey to determine parental knowledge of adolescent hearing loss and willingness to promote hearing conservation to discern information that is critical to design adolescent hearing loss prevention programs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional, Internet-based survey of a nationally representative online sample of parents of 13- to 17-year-olds. INTERVENTIONS: A survey conducted with the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health, a recurring online survey. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Parental knowledge of adolescent hearing loss and willingness to promote hearing conservation. RESULTS: Of 716 eligible respondents, 96.3% of parents reported that their adolescent was slightly or not at all at risk of hearing problems from excessive noise, and 69.0% had not spoken with their adolescent about noise exposure, mainly because of the perceived low risk. Nonetheless, to protect their adolescents' hearing, more than 65.0% of parents are either willing or very willing to consider limiting time listening to music, limiting access to excessively noisy situations, or insisting on the use of hearing protection (earplugs or earmuffs). Higher parental education increased the odds of promoting hearing-protective strategies. Parents were less likely to insist on hearing protection for older adolescents. Parents who understood that both volume and time of exposure affect hearing damage were more likely to have discussed hearing loss with their adolescent (odds ratio [OR], 1.98; 95% CI, 1.29-3.03). The odds of discussing hearing loss were also increased for those who were willing or very willing to limit time listening to music (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.19-2.26) and to insist on hearing protection (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.15-3.18) compared with parents who were very unwilling, unwilling, or neutral. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite the rising prevalence of acquired adolescent hearing loss, few parents believe their adolescent is at risk. Those with higher education are more willing to promote hearing conservation, especially with younger adolescents. To create effective hearing conservation programs, parents need better education on this subject as well as effective and acceptable strategies to prevent adolescent noise exposure.","Adolescent *Adolescent Behavior Cross-Sectional Studies Female Hearing Loss, Noise-Induced/*prevention & control Humans Internet Male *Parent-Child Relations Parents/*psychology Risk Factors"
24042491,Incidence of dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia.,JAMA Neurol,Savica R and Grossardt BR and Bower JH and Boeve BF and Ahlskog JE and Rocca WA,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Epidemiologic data on dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) remain limited in the United States and worldwide. These data are essential to guide research and clinical or public health interventions. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of DLB among residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, and compare it with the incidence of PDD. DESIGN: The medical records linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project was used to identify all persons who developed parkinsonism and, in particular, DLB or PDD from 1991 through 2005 (15 years). A movement disorders specialist reviewed the complete medical records of each suspected patient to confirm the diagnosis. SETTING: Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1991 through 2005 (15 years). PARTICIPANTS: All the residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who gave authorization for medical record research. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of DLB and PDD. RESULTS: Among 542 incident cases of parkinsonism, 64 had DLB and 46 had PDD. The incidence rate of DLB was 3.5 per 100,000 person-years overall, and it increased steeply with age. The incidence of PDD was 2.5 overall and also increased steeply with age. The incidence rate of DLB and PDD combined was 5.9. Patients with DLB were younger at onset of symptoms than patients with PDD and had more hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations. Men had a higher incidence of DLB than women across the age spectrum. The pathology was consistent with the clinical diagnosis in 24 of 31 patients (77.4%) who underwent autopsy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The overall incidence rate of DLB is lower than the rate of Parkinson disease. The incidence of DLB increases steeply with age and is markedly higher in men. This men to women difference may suggest different etiologic mechanisms. Our findings may guide health care planning and prompt new studies.","Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Dementia/*complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology Female Humans Incidence Lewy Body Disease/diagnosis/*epidemiology Longitudinal Studies Male Middle Aged Minnesota/epidemiology Parkinson Disease/*complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Reproducibility of Results Retrospective Studies Severity of Illness Index Sex Factors"
24756690,Outpatient care patterns and organizational accountability in Medicare.,JAMA Intern Med,McWilliams JM and Chernew ME and Dalton JB and Landon BE,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Fostering accountability in the Medicare Accountable Care Organization (ACO) programs may be challenging because traditional Medicare beneficiaries have unrestricted choice of health care providers, are attributed to ACOs based on utilization, and often receive fragmented care. OBJECTIVE: To measure 3 related constructs relevant to ACO incentives and their capacity to manage care: stability of patient assignment, leakage of outpatient care, and contract penetration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using 2010-2011 Medicare claims and rosters of physicians in organizations participating in ACO programs, we examined these constructs among 524,246 beneficiaries hypothetically assigned to 145 ACOs prior to the start of the Medicare ACO programs. We compared estimates by patient complexity, ACO size, and the primary care orientation of ACO specialty mix. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Three related construct measurements: stability of assignment, defined as the proportion of patients whose assignment to an ACO in 2010 was unchanged in 2011; leakage of outpatient care, defined as the proportion of office visits for an assigned population that occurred outside of the contracting organization; and contract penetration, defined as the proportion of Medicare outpatient spending billed by an ACO that was devoted to assigned patients. RESULTS: Of beneficiaries assigned to an ACO in 2010, 80.4% were assigned to the same ACO in 2011. Of those assigned to an ACO in 2010 or 2011, 66.0% were consistently assigned in both years. Unstable assignment was more common among beneficiaries with fewer conditions and office visits but also among those in several high-cost categories, including the highest decile of per-beneficiary spending. Among ACO-assigned beneficiaries, 8.7% of office visits with primary care physicians were provided outside of the assigned ACO, and 66.7% of office visits with specialists were provided outside of the assigned ACO. Leakage of outpatient specialty care was greater for higher-cost beneficiaries and substantial even among specialty-oriented ACOs (54.6% for lowest quartile of primary care orientation). Of Medicare spending on outpatient care billed by ACO physicians, 37.9% was devoted to assigned beneficiaries. This proportion was higher for ACOs with greater primary care orientation (60.0% for highest quartile vs 33.6% for lowest). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Care patterns among beneficiaries served by ACOs suggest distinct challenges in achieving organizational accountability in Medicare. Continued monitoring of these patterns may be important to determine the regulatory need for enhancing ACOs' incentives and their ability to improve care efficiency.",Accountable Care Organizations/*statistics & numerical data Ambulatory Care/*statistics & numerical data Humans Medicare/*organization & administration/statistics & numerical data Primary Health Care/*statistics & numerical data United States
23699709,"Patient outcomes, satisfaction, and improvement in headaches after endoscopic brow-lift.",JAMA Facial Plast Surg,Panella NJ and Wallin JL and Goldman ND,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: To improve preoperative counseling for patients considering endoscopic brow-lift (EBL). OBJECTIVES: To understand patient-reported outcomes, satisfaction, and recovery after EBL surgery to improve preoperative counseling. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective telephone survey of 57 patients who had EBL or EBL with concurrent rhytidectomy to assess cosmetic and functional outcomes using 47 questions. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Questions evaluated outcomes, satisfaction, and recovery. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (93%) reported the procedure was successful, and 55 patients (96%) would recommend undergoing this procedure. Forty-two (74%) were incidentally told they looked younger; 37 patients (65%) were told they looked less tired. Forty-two patients (74%) reported increased confidence. Fifty-one patients (89%) required analgesics for less than 1 week, 44 patients (77%) reported scars as unnoticeable, 54 patients (95%) reported postoperative edema lasting less than 2 weeks, 16 patients (28%) reported alopecia at an incision site, and 36 patients (63%) had some numbness. In the 16 patients who reported headaches before surgery, 8 patients (50%) reported an improvement in either frequency or intensity. Patients who underwent rhytidectomy were significantly more likely to take 2 weeks or longer to return to normal activities. No differences were noted between rhytidectomy with EBL compared with EBL alone in analgesic use, edema, numbness, alopecia, and satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Endoscopic brow-lift is well tolerated and most patients are happy with the outcome. Relying on patient-reported information helps us to better understand the surgical experience and to improve preoperative counseling.

24887456,"The political polarization of physicians in the United States: an analysis of campaign contributions to federal elections, 1991 through 2012.",JAMA Intern Med,Bonica A and Rosenthal H and Rothman DJ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Few current data are available regarding the political behavior of American physicians as the number of female physicians has increased and the number of solo practitioners has decreased. OBJECTIVE: To analyze campaign contributions that physicians made from the 1991 to 1992 through the 2011 to 2012 election cycles to Republican and Democratic candidates in presidential and congressional races and to partisan organizations, including party committees and super political action committees (Super PACs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We explored partisan differences in physician contributions by sex, for-profit vs nonprofit practice setting, and specialty using multiple regression analysis. We studied the relation between the variation in the mean annual income across specialties and the mean percentage of physicians within each specialty contributing to Republicans. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Differences in contributions to Republicans and Democrats, for all physicians and for subgroups. RESULTS: Between the 1991 to 1992 and the 2011 to 2012 election cycles, physician campaign contributions increased from $20 million to $189 million, and the percentage of active physicians contributing increased from 2.6% to 9.4%. Of physicians who contributed during the study period, the mean percentage contributing to Republicans was 57% for men and 31% for women. Since 1996, the percentage of physicians contributing to Republicans has decreased, to less than 50% in the 2007 to 2008 election cycle and again in the 2011 to 2012 election cycle. Contributions to Republicans in 2011 to 2012 were more prevalent among men vs women (52.3% vs 23.6%), physicians practicing in for-profit vs nonprofit organizations (53.2% vs 25.6%), and surgeons vs pediatricians (70.2% vs 22.1%). In 1991 to 1992, these contribution gaps were smaller: for sex, 54.5% vs 30.9%; for organizations, 54.2% vs 40.0%; and for specialty, 65.5% vs 32.7%. The percentage of physicians contributing to Republicans across specialties correlated 0.84 with the mean log earnings of each specialty; specialties with higher mean earnings had higher percentages of physicians contributing to Republicans. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Between 1991 and 2012, the political alignment of US physicians shifted from predominantly Republican toward the Democrats. The variables driving this change, including the increasing percentage of female physicians and the decreasing percentage of physicians in solo and small practices, are likely to drive further changes.",Missing
25054486,Long-term Results of a Postoperative Pneumonia Prevention Program for the Inpatient Surgical Ward.,JAMA Surg,Kazaure HS and Martin M and Yoon JK and Wren SM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Pneumonia is the third most common complication in postoperative patients and is associated with significant morbidity and high cost of care. Prevention has focused primarily on mechanically ventilated patients. This study outlines the results of the longest-running postoperative pneumonia prevention program for nonmechanically ventilated patients, to our knowledge. OBJECTIVE: To present long-term results (2008-2012) of a standardized postoperative ward-acquired pneumonia prevention program introduced in 2007 on the surgical ward of our hospital and compare our postintervention pneumonia rates with those captured in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP). We also estimate the cost savings attributable to the pneumonia prevention program. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study at a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs hospital of all noncardiac surgical patients with ward-acquired postoperative pneumonia. INTERVENTION: A previously described standardized postoperative pneumonia prevention program for patients on the surgical ward. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Ward-acquired postoperative pneumonia. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2012, there were 18 cases of postoperative pneumonia among 4099 at-risk patients hospitalized on the surgical ward, yielding a case rate of 0.44%. This represents a 43.6% decrease from our preintervention rate (0.78%) (P = .01). The pneumonia rates in all years were lower than the preintervention rate (0.25%, 0.50%, 0.58%, 0.68%, and 0.13% in 2008-2012, respectively). The overall pneumonia rate in ACS-NSQIP was 2.56% (14 033 cases of pneumonia among 547 571 at-risk patients), which is 582% higher than the postintervention rate at our ward. Using a national average of $46 400 in attributable health care cost of postoperative pneumonia and a benchmark of a 43.6% decrease in pneumonia rate achieved at our facility over the 5-year study period, a similar percentage of decrease in pneumonia occurrence at ACS-NSQIP hospitals would represent approximately 6118 prevented pneumonia cases and a cost savings of more than $280 million. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The standardized pneumonia prevention program achieved substantial and sustained reduction in postoperative pneumonia incidence on our surgical ward; its wider adoption could improve postoperative outcomes and reduce overall health care costs.",Missing

In addition, we analyzed climate data averaged over 13 climate models and based future projections on downscaled probability distributions of the daily maximum temperature for 2046-2065. We also compared maximum daily 8-hour average with air temperature data taken from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Climate Data Center. Results: By 2050, many US cities may experience more frequent extreme heat days. For example, New York and Milwaukee may have 3 times their current average number of days hotter than 32 degrees C (90 degrees F). The adverse health aspects related to climate change may include heat-related disorders, such as heat stress and economic consequences of reduced work capacity; and respiratory disorders, including those exacerbated by fine particulate pollutants, such as asthma and allergic disorders; infectious diseases, including vectorborne diseases and water-borne diseases, such as childhood gastrointestinal diseases; food insecurity, including reduced crop yields and an increase in plant diseases; and mental health disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder and depression, that are associated with natural disasters. Substantial health and economic cobenefits could be associated with reductions in fossil fuel combustion. For example, the cost of greenhouse gas emission policies may yield net economic benefit, with health benefits from air quality improvements potentially offsetting the cost of US carbon policies. Conclusions and Relevance: Evidence over the past 20 years indicates that climate change can be associated with adverse health outcomes. Health care professionals have an important role in understanding and communicating the related potential health concerns and the cobenefits from reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",Missing

23380910,Evaluation of potential infectivity of Alzheimer and Parkinson disease proteins in recipients of cadaver-derived human growth hormone.,JAMA Neurol,Irwin DJ and Abrams JY and Schonberger LB and Leschek EW and Mills JL and Lee VM and Trojanowski JQ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Growing evidence of cell-to-cell transmission of neurodegenerative disease (ND)-associated proteins (NDAPs) (ie, tau, Abeta, and alpha-synuclein) suggests possible similarities to the infectious prion protein (PrPsc) in spongiform encephalopathies. There are limited data on the potential human-to-human transmission of NDAPs associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) and other non-PrPsc ND. OBJECTIVE: To examine evidence for human-to-human transmission of AD, Parkinson disease (PD), and related NDAPs in cadaveric human growth hormone (c-hGH) recipients. DESIGN: We conducted a detailed immunohistochemical analysis of pathological NDAPs other than PrPsc in human pituitary glands. We also searched for ND in recipients of pituitary-derived c-hGH by reviewing the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP) cohort database and medical literature. SETTING: University-based academic center and agencies of the US Department of Health and Human Services. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four routine autopsy subjects (10 non-ND controls and 24 patients with ND) and a US cohort of c-hGH recipients in the NHPP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detectable NDAPs in human pituitary sections and death certificate reports of non-PrPsc ND in the NHPP database. RESULTS: We found mild amounts of pathological tau, Abeta, and alpha-synuclein deposits in the adeno/neurohypophysis of patients with ND and control patients. No cases of AD or PD were identified, and 3 deaths attributed to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were found among US NHPP c-hGH recipients, including 2 of the 796 decedents in the originally confirmed NHPP c-hGH cohort database. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite the likely frequent exposure of c-hGH recipients to NDAPs, and their markedly elevated risk of PrPsc-related disease, this population of NHPP c-hGH recipients does not appear to be at increased risk of AD or PD. We discovered 3 ALS cases of unclear significance among US c-hGH recipients despite the absence of pathological deposits of ALS-associated proteins (TDP-43, FUS, and ubiquilin) in human pituitary glands. In this unique in vivo model of human-to-human transmission, we found no evidence to support concerns that NDAPs underlying AD and PD transmit disease in humans despite evidence of their cell-to-cell transmission in model systems of these disorders. Further monitoring is required to confirm these conclusions.","Alzheimer Disease/*pathology Amyloid beta-Peptides/*metabolism Cadaver Cohort Studies Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data Female Human Growth Hormone/*adverse effects Humans Male Neurites/metabolism/pathology Neurons/pathology Parkinson Disease/*pathology Pituitary Gland/*metabolism/pathology United States United States Public Health Service alpha-Synuclein/*metabolism tau Proteins/*metabolism"
24828276,Effect of prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke on inhibitory control: neuroimaging results from a 25-year prospective study.,JAMA Psychiatry,Holz NE and Boecker R and Baumeister S and Hohm E and Zohsel K and Buchmann AF and Blomeyer D and Jennen-Steinmetz C and Hohmann S and Wolf I and Plichta MM and Meyer-Lindenberg A and Banaschewski T and Brandeis D and Laucht M,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: There is accumulating evidence relating maternal smoking during pregnancy to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) without elucidating specific mechanisms. Research investigating the neurobiological underpinnings of this disorder has implicated deficits during response inhibition. Attempts to uncover the effect of prenatal exposure to nicotine on inhibitory control may thus be of high clinical importance. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the influence of maternal smoking during pregnancy (hereafter referred to as prenatal smoking) on the neural circuitry of response inhibition and its association with related behavioral phenotypes such as ADHD and novelty seeking in the mother's offspring. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed for the offspring at 25 years of age during a modified Eriksen flanker/NoGo task, and voxel-based morphometry was performed to study brain volume differences of the offspring. Prenatal smoking (1-5 cigarettes per day [14 mothers] or >5 cigarettes per day [24 mothers]) and lifetime ADHD symptoms were determined using standardized parent interviews at the offspring's age of 3 months and over a period of 13 years (from 2 to 15 years of age), respectively. Novelty seeking was assessed at 19 years of age. Analyses were adjusted for sex, parental postnatal smoking, psychosocial and obstetric adversity, maternal prenatal stress, and lifetime substance abuse. A total of 178 young adults (73 males) without current psychopathology from a community sample followed since birth (Mannheim, Germany) participated in the study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Functional magnetic resonance imaging response, morphometric data, lifetime ADHD symptoms, and novelty seeking. RESULTS: Participants prenatally exposed to nicotine exhibited a weaker response in the anterior cingulate cortex (t168 = 4.46; peak Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates x = -2, y = 20, z = 30; familywise error [FWE]-corrected P = .003), the right inferior frontal gyrus (t168 = 3.65; peak MNI coordinates x = 44, y = 38, z = 12; FWE-corrected P = .04), the left inferior frontal gyrus (t168 = 4.09; peak MNI coordinates x = -38, y = 36, z = 8; FWE-corrected P = .009), and the supramarginal gyrus (t168 = 5.03; peak MNI coordinates x = 64, y = -28, z = 22; FWE-corrected P = .02) during the processing of the NoGo compared to neutral stimuli, while presenting a decreased volume in the right inferior frontal gyrus. These findings were obtained irrespective of the adjustment of confounders, ADHD symptoms, and novelty seeking. There was an inverse relationship between inferior frontal gyrus activity and ADHD symptoms and between anterior cingulate cortex activity and novelty seeking. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings point to a functional involvement of prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke in neural alterations similar to ADHD, which underlines the importance of smoking prevention treatments.","Adolescent Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*physiopathology/psychology Child Child, Preschool Exploratory Behavior/physiology Female Frontal Lobe/physiopathology *Functional Neuroimaging/methods Humans Infant *Inhibition (Psychology) Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Nicotine/*adverse effects Pregnancy Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*physiopathology/psychology Prospective Studies Smoking/*adverse effects Young Adult"

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether oral supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 during the first 3 months of life can reduce the onset of colic, gastroesophageal reflux, and constipation in term newborns and thereby reduce the socioeconomic impact of these conditions. DESIGN: A prospective, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was performed on term newborns (age <1 week) born at 9 different neonatal units in Italy between September 1, 2010, and October 30, 2012. SETTING: Parents were asked to record in a structured diary the number of episodes of regurgitation, duration of inconsolable crying (minutes per day), number of evacuations per day, number of visits to pediatricians, feeding changes, hospitalizations, visits to a pediatric emergency department for a perceived health emergency, pharmacologic interventions, and loss of parental working days. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 589 infants were randomly allocated to receive L reuteri DSM 17938 or placebo daily for 90 days. INTERVENTIONS: Prophylactic use of probiotic. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reduction of daily crying time, regurgitation, and constipation during the first 3 months of life. Cost-benefit analysis of the probiotic supplementation. RESULTS: At 3 months of age, the mean duration of crying time (38 vs 71 minutes; P < .01), the mean number of regurgitations per day (2.9 vs 4.6; P < .01), and the mean number of evacuations per day (4.2 vs 3.6; P < .01) for the L reuteri DSM 17938 and placebo groups, respectively, were significantly different. The use of L reuteri DSM 17938 resulted in an estimated mean savings per patient of euro88 (US $118.71) for the family and an additional euro104 (US $140.30) for the community. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Prophylactic use of L reuteri DSM 17938 during the first 3 months of life reduced the onset of functional gastrointestinal disorders and reduced private and public costs for the management of this condition.

24100440,Probiotics to prevent or treat excessive infant crying: systematic review and meta-analysis.,JAMA Pediatr,Sung V and Collett S and de Gooyer T and Hiscock H and Tang M and Wake M,Missing,"IMPORTANCE Excessive infant crying is common, distressing, but without proven effective prevention or management options. Probiotics may be a promising solution. OBJECTIVE To examine whether probiotics are effective in the prevention/management of crying (""colic"") in infants 3 months or younger. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, supplemented by the metaRegister of Controlled Trials. STUDY SELECTION Studies that randomized infants 3 months or younger to oral probiotics vs placebo or no or standard treatment with the outcome of infant crying, measured as the duration or number of episodes of infant crying/distress or diagnosis of ""infant colic."" Twelve of the 1180 initially identified studies were selected. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS This review/meta-analysis was conducted according to guidelines from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, with reporting following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Data were independently extracted by 3 of us. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S) Infant crying, measured as the duration or number of episodes of infant crying/distress, or diagnosis of ""infant colic."" RESULTS Of the 12 trials (1825 infants) reviewed, 6 suggested probiotics reduced crying, and 6 did not. Three of the 5 management trials concluded probiotics effectively treat colic in breastfed babies; 1 suggested possible effectiveness in formula-fed babies with colic, and 1 suggested ineffectiveness in breastfed babies with colic. Meta-analysis of 3 small trials of breastfed infants with colic found that Lactobacillus reuteri markedly reduced crying time at 21 days (median difference, -65 minutes/d; 95% CI, -86 to -44). However, all trials had potential biases. Meanwhile, of 7 prevention trials, 2 suggested possible benefits. Considerable variability in the study populations, study type, delivery mode/dose of probiotic supplementation, and outcomes precluded meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although L reuteri may be effective as treatment for crying in exclusively breastfed infants with colic, there is still insufficient evidence to support probiotic use to manage colic, especially in formula-fed infants, or to prevent infant crying. Results from larger rigorously designed studies applicable to all crying infants will help draw more definitive conclusions.",Colic/*therapy Crying/*physiology Humans Infant Infant Behavior/*drug effects Probiotics/*therapeutic use Treatment Outcome

Yet, there are few large survey studies of factors that affect women's decisions for this surgical treatment option. OBJECTIVE To determine factors associated with the use of CPM in a population-based sample of patients with breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A longitudinal survey of 2290 women newly diagnosed as having breast cancer who reported to the Detroit and Los Angeles Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries from June 1, 2005, to February 1, 2007, and again 4 years later (June 2009 to February 2010) merged with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry data (n = 1536). Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with type of surgery. Primary independent variables included clinical indications for CPM (genetic mutation and/or strong family history), diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging, and patient extent of worry about recurrence at the time of treatment decision making. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Type of surgery received from patient self-report, categorized as CPM, unilateral mastectomy, or breast conservation surgery. RESULTS Of the 1447 women in the analytic sample, 18.9% strongly considered CPM and 7.6% received it. Of those who strongly considered CPM, 32.2% received CPM, while 45.8% received unilateral mastectomy and 22.8% received breast conservation surgery (BCS). The majority of patients (68.9%) who received CPM had no major genetic or familial risk factors for contralateral disease. Multivariate regression showed that receipt of CPM (vs either unilateral mastectomy or breast conservation surgery) was significantly associated with genetic testing (positive or negative) (vs UM, relative risk ratio [RRR]: 10.48; 95% CI, 3.61-3.48 and vs BCS, RRR: 19.10; 95% CI, 5.67-56.41; P &lt; .001), a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer (vs UM, RRR: 5.19; 95% CI, 2.34-11.56 and vs BCS, RRR: 4.24; 95% CI, 1.80-9.88; P = .001), receipt of magnetic resonance imaging (vs UM RRR: 2.07; 95% CI, 1.21-3.52 and vs BCS, RRR: 2.14; 95% CI, 1.28-3.58; P = .001), higher education (vs UM, RRR: 5.04; 95% CI, 2.37-10.71 and vs BCS, RRR: 4.38; 95% CI, 2.07-9.29; P &lt; .001), and greater worry about recurrence (vs UM, RRR: 2.81; 95% CI, 1.14-6.88 and vs BCS, RRR: 4.24; 95% CI, 1.80-9.98; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Many women considered CPM and a substantial number received it, although few had a clinically significant risk of contralateral breast cancer. Receipt of magnetic resonance imaging at diagnosis contributed to receipt of CPM. Worry about recurrence appeared to drive decisions for CPM although the procedure has not been shown to reduce recurrence risk. More research is needed about the underlying factors driving the use of CPM.",Missing
23446644,Full spectrum of psychiatric disorders related to foreign migration: a Danish population-based cohort study.,JAMA Psychiatry,Cantor-Graae E and Pedersen CB,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Although increased risk for schizophrenia among immigrants is well established, knowledge of the broader spectrum of psychiatric disorders associated with a foreign migration background is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To examine the full range of psychiatric disorders associated with any type of foreign migration background among persons residing in Denmark, including foreign-born adoptees, first- and second-generation immigrants, native Danes with a history of foreign residence, and persons born abroad to Danish expatriates. DESIGN AND SETTING: Danish population-based cohort study. Persons were followed up from their 10th birthday for the development of mental disorders based on outpatient and inpatient data. PARTICIPANTS: All persons born between January 1, 1971, and December 31, 2000 (N = 1 859 419) residing in Denmark by their 10th birthday with follow-up data to December 31, 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and cumulative incidences for psychiatric outcomes. RESULTS: All categories of foreign migration background, except persons born abroad to Danish expatriates, were associated with increased risk for at least 1 psychiatric disorder. Foreign-born adoptees had increased IRRs for all psychiatric disorders and had the highest IRRs for these disorders compared with other foreign migration categories. First- and second-generation immigrants having 2 foreign-born parents had significantly increased IRRs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders and had similar risk magnitudes. Second-generation immigrants having 1 foreign-born parent had significantly increased IRRs for all psychiatric disorders. Native Danes with a history of foreign residence had increased IRRs for bipolar affective disorder, affective disorders, personality disorders, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The extent to which a background of foreign migration confers an increased risk for the broad spectrum of psychiatric disorders varies according to parental origin, with greatest risks for foreign-born adoptees. The spectrum of psychiatric disorders showed greater variation within the second-generation immigrant group than between first-generation vs second-generation immigrants, and the spectrum differed according to whether individuals had 1 or 2 foreign-born parents.",Adolescent Adult Age Factors Bipolar Disorder/epidemiology/ethnology/etiology Child Cohort Studies Denmark/epidemiology Emigrants and Immigrants/*psychology Female Humans Incidence Male Mental Disorders/epidemiology/ethnology/*etiology Mood Disorders/epidemiology/ethnology/etiology Personality Disorders/epidemiology/ethnology/etiology Risk Factors Schizophrenia/epidemiology/ethnology/etiology Sex Factors Young Adult

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Direct household interviews of combined household and school samples representative of the general population of adolescents in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Ten thousand one hundred twenty-three adolescents aged 13 to 18 years who participated in the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement. MAIN EXPOSURES: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) mental disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders. OUTCOME MEASURE: Psychotropic medication use in the past 12 months. RESULTS: Among youth with any DSM-IV mental disorder, 14.2% reported that they had been treated with a psychotropic medication in the past 12 months. Strong associations emerged between specific disorders and classes of medications with evidence for efficacy. Antidepressants were most frequently used among those with primary mood disorders (14.1%); stimulant use was most common among those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (20.4%); and antipsychotic use was infrequent and mostly seen among those with serious developmental disorders. Less than 2.5% of adolescents without a 12-month mental disorder had been prescribed psychotropic medications, and most had evidence of psychological distress or impairment reflected in a previous mental disorder, subthreshold condition, or developmental disorder. Appropriate medication use was significantly more frequent among those in treatment in the mental health specialty sector than general medicine or other settings. CONCLUSIONS: These findings challenge recent concerns over widespread overmedication and misuse of psychotropic medications in US youth.

Resubmission of failed applications is costly, delaying marketing approval and the availability of new drugs to patients. OBJECTIVE: To identify the reasons that FDA marketing approval for new drugs was delayed or denied. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective review of FDA documents and extraction of data were performed. We examined all drug applications first submitted to the FDA between 2000 and 2012 for new molecular entities (NMEs), which are active ingredients never before marketed in the United States in any form. Using FDA correspondence and reviews, we investigated the reasons NMEs failed to obtain FDA approval. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reasons for delayed FDA approval or nonapproval of NME applications. RESULTS: Of the 302 identified NME applications, 151 (50%) were approved when first submitted and 222 (73.5%) were ultimately approved. Seventy-one applications required 1 or more resubmissions before approval, with a median delay to approval of 435 days following the first unsuccessful submission. Of the unsuccessful first-time applications, 24 (15.9%) included uncertainties related to dose selection, 20 (13.2%) choice of study end points that failed to adequately reflect a clinically meaningful effect, 20 (13.2%) inconsistent results when different end points were tested, 17 (11.3%) inconsistent results when different trials or study sites were compared, and 20 (13.2%) poor efficacy when compared with the standard of care. The frequency of safety deficiencies was similar among never-approved drugs compared with those with delayed approval (43 of 80 never approved [53.8%] vs 37 of 71 eventually approved [52.1%]; difference, 1.7% [95% CI, -14.86% to 18.05%]; P = .87). However, efficacy deficiencies were significantly more frequent among the never-approved drugs than among those with delayed approvals (61 of 80 never approved [76.3%] vs 28 of 71 eventually approved [39.4%]; difference, 36.9% [95% CI, 20.25% to 50.86%]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Several potentially preventable deficiencies, including failure to select optimal drug doses and suitable study end points, accounted for significant delays in the approval of new drugs.

23426473,Common causes of injury and legal action in laser surgery.,JAMA Dermatol,Jalian HR and Jalian CA and Avram MM,partners,"OBJECTIVE: To identify common causes of legal action, injuries, claims, and decisions related to medical professional liability claims stemming from cutaneous laser surgery. DESIGN: Search of online public legal documents using a national database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency and nature of cases, including year of litigation, location and certification of provider, injury sustained, cause of legal action, verdict, and indemnity payment. RESULTS: From 1985 to 2012, the authors identified 174 cases related to injury stemming from cutaneous laser surgery. The incidence of litigation related to laser surgery shows an increasing trend, with peak occurrence in 2010. Laser hair removal was the most common litigated procedure. Nonphysician operators accounted for a substantial subset of these cases, with their physician supervisors named as defendants, despite not performing the procedure. Plastic surgery was the specialty most frequently litigated against. Of the preventable causes of action, the most common was failure to obtain an informed consent. Of the 120 cases with public decisions, 61 (50.8%) resulted in decisions in favor of the plaintiff. The mean indemnity payment was $380 719. CONCLUSIONS: Claims related to cutaneous laser surgery are increasing and result in indemnity payments that exceed the previously reported average across all medical specialties. Nonphysicians performing these procedures will be held to a standard of care corresponding to an individual with appropriate training; thus, physicians are ultimately responsible for the actions of their nonphysician agents.","Cosmetic Techniques/*adverse effects Databases, Factual Hair Removal/methods Humans Informed Consent/legislation & jurisprudence Laser Therapy/*adverse effects *Liability, Legal/economics Malpractice/economics Reconstructive Surgical Procedures/adverse effects/*legislation & jurisprudence Surgery, Plastic/adverse effects/legislation & jurisprudence"
24258010,Relationship between regional spending on vascular care and amputation rate.,JAMA Surg,Goodney PP and Travis LL and Brooke BS and DeMartino RR and Goodman DC and Fisher ES and Birkmeyer JD,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Although lower extremity revascularization is effective in preventing amputation, the relationship between spending on vascular care and regional amputation rates remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that higher regional spending on vascular care is associated with lower amputation rates for patients with severe peripheral arterial disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of 18,463 US Medicare patients who underwent a major peripheral arterial disease-related amputation during the period between 2003 and 2010. EXPOSURE: Price-adjusted Medicare spending on revascularization procedures and related vascular care in the year before lower extremity amputation, across hospital referral regions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Correlation coefficient between regional spending on vascular care and regional rates of peripheral arterial disease-related amputation. RESULTS: Among patients who ultimately underwent an amputation, 64% were admitted to the hospital in the year prior to the amputation for revascularization, wound-related care, or both; 36% were admitted only for their amputation. The mean cost of inpatient care in the year before amputation, including costs related to the amputation procedure itself, was $22,405, but it varied from $11,077 (Bismarck, North Dakota) to $42,613 (Salinas, California) (P < .001). Patients in high-spending regions were more likely to undergo vascular procedures as determined by crude analyses (12.0 procedures per 10,000 patients in the lowest quintile of spending and 20.4 procedures per 10,000 patients in the highest quintile of spending; P < .001) and by risk-adjusted analyses (adjusted odds ratio for receiving a vascular procedure in highest quintile of spending, 3.5 [95% CI, 3.2-3.8]; P < .001). Although revascularization was associated with higher spending (R = 0.38, P < .001), higher spending was not associated with lower regional amputation rates (R = 0.10, P = .06). The regions that were most aggressive in the use of endovascular interventions were the regions that were most likely to have high spending (R = 0.42, P = .002) and high amputation rates (R = 0.40, P = .004). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Regions that spend the most on vascular care perform the most procedures, especially endovascular interventions, in the year before amputation. However, there is little evidence that higher regional spending is associated with lower amputation rates. This suggests an opportunity to limit costs in vascular care without compromising quality.",Aged Amputation/*statistics & numerical data Cohort Studies Female *Health Care Costs Humans Male Medicare Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment United States Vascular Surgical Procedures/*economics
23681029,Hemispheric dominance and cell phone use.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Seidman MD and Siegel B and Shah P and Bowyer SM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: A thorough understanding of why we hold a cell phone to a particular ear may be of importance when studying the impact of cell phone safety. OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is an obvious association between sidedness of cell phone use and auditory hemispheric dominance (AHD) or language hemispheric dominance (LHD). It is known that 70% to 95% of the population are right-handed, and of these, 96% have left-brain LHD. We have observed that most people use their cell phones in their right ear. DESIGN: An Internet survey was e-mailed to individuals through surveymonkey.com. The survey used a modified Edinburgh Handedness Inventory protocol. Sample questions surveyed which hand was used to write with, whether the right or left ear was used for phone conversations, as well as whether a brain tumor was present. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: An Internet survey was randomly e-mailed to 5000 individuals selected from an otology online group, patients undergoing Wada testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging, as well as persons on the university listserv, of which 717 surveys were completed. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Determination of hemispheric dominance based on preferred ear for cell phone use. RESULTS: A total of 717 surveys were returned. Ninety percent of the respondents were right handed, and 9% were left handed. Sixty-eight percent of the right-handed people used the cell phone in their right ear, 25% in the left ear, and 7% had no preference. Seventy-two of the left-handed respondents used their left ear, 23% used their right ear, and 5% had no preference. Cell phone use averaged 540 minutes per month over the past 9 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: An association exists between hand dominance laterality of cell phone use (73%) and our ability to predict hemispheric dominance. Most right-handed people have left-brain LHD and use their cell phone in their right ear. Similarly, most left-handed people use their cell phone in their left ear.

23592104,Relationship between occurrence of surgical complications and hospital finances.,JAMA,Eappen S and Lane BH and Rosenberg B and Lipsitz SA and Sadoff D and Matheson D and Berry WR and Lester M and Gawande AA,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The effect of surgical complications on hospital finances is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between major surgical complications and per-encounter hospital costs and revenues by payer type. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis of administrative data for all inpatient surgical discharges during 2010 from a nonprofit 12-hospital system in the southern United States. Discharges were categorized by principal procedure and occurrence of 1 or more postsurgical complications, using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis and procedure codes. Nine common surgical procedures and 10 major complications across 4 payer types were analyzed. Hospital costs and revenue at discharge were obtained from hospital accounting systems and classified by payer type. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospital costs, revenues, and contribution margin (defined as revenue minus variable expenses) were compared for patients with and without surgical complications according to payer type. RESULTS: Of 34,256 surgical discharges, 1820 patients (5.3%; 95% CI, 4.4%-6.4%) experienced 1 or more postsurgical complications. Compared with absence of complications, complications were associated with a $39,017 (95% CI, $20,069-$50,394; P < .001) higher contribution margin per patient with private insurance ($55,953 vs $16,936) and a $1749 (95% CI, $976-$3287; P < .001) higher contribution margin per patient with Medicare ($3629 vs $1880). For this hospital system in which private insurers covered 40% of patients (13,544), Medicare covered 45% (15,406), Medicaid covered 4% (1336), and self-payment covered 6% (2202), occurrence of complications was associated with an $8084 (95% CI, $4903-$9740; P < .001) higher contribution margin per patient ($15,726 vs $7642) and with a $7435 lower per-patient total margin (95% CI, $5103-$10,507; P < .001) ($1013 vs -$6422). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this hospital system, the occurrence of postsurgical complications was associated with a higher per-encounter hospital contribution margin for patients covered by Medicare and private insurance but a lower one for patients covered by Medicaid and who self-paid. Depending on payer mix, many hospitals have the potential for adverse near-term financial consequences for decreasing postsurgical complications.","Aged *Cost Sharing *Diagnosis-Related Groups *Financial Management, Hospital Hospital Costs/*statistics & numerical data Hospitals, Voluntary/economics Humans Insurance, Health/economics International Classification of Diseases Medicaid/economics Medicare/economics Middle Aged Patient Discharge/*statistics & numerical data Postoperative Complications/*economics Private Sector Reimbursement, Incentive Retrospective Studies United States"
23588683,Examining pregnant women's hostile attributions about infants as a predictor of offspring maltreatment.,JAMA Pediatr,Berlin LJ and Dodge KA and Reznick JS,umaryland,"IMPORTANCE: Child maltreatment is a serious public health problem that disproportionately affects infants and toddlers. In the interest of informing prevention and intervention efforts, this study examined pregnant women's attributions about infants as a risk factor for child maltreatment and harsh parenting during their children's first and second years. We also provide specific methods for practitioners to assess hostile attributions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate pregnant women's hostile attributions about infants as a risk factor for early child maltreatment and harsh parenting. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal study. SETTING: A small Southeastern city and its surrounding county. PARTICIPANTS: A diverse, community-based sample of 499 pregnant women. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Official records of child maltreatment and mother-reported harsh parenting behaviors. Hostile attributions were examined in terms of women's beliefs about infants' negative intentions (eg, the extent to which infants purposefully dirty their diapers). RESULTS: Mothers' hostile attributions increased the likelihood that their child would be maltreated by the age of 26 months (adjusted odds ratio, 1.26 [90% CI, 1.02-1.56]). Mothers who made more hostile attributions during pregnancy reported engaging in more harsh parenting behaviors when their children were toddlers (beta = 0.14, P < .05). Both associations were robust to the inclusion of 7 psychosocial covariates. CONCLUSIONS: AND RELEVANCE: A pregnant woman's hostile attributions about infant's intentions signal risk for maltreatment and harsh parenting of her child during the first years of life. Practitioners' attention to women's hostile attributions may help identify those in need of immediate practitioner input and/or referral to parenting services.","Adolescent Adult *Attitude Child Child Abuse/diagnosis/prevention & control/*psychology Child, Preschool Female *Hostility Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Intention Linear Models Logistic Models Longitudinal Studies Male *Maternal Behavior Parenting/*psychology Pregnancy Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Self Report Young Adult"
23982369,Changes in health care spending and quality for Medicare beneficiaries associated with a commercial ACO contract.,JAMA,McWilliams JM and Landon BE and Chernew ME,harvard,"IMPORTANCE: In a multipayer system, new payment incentives implemented by one insurer for an accountable care organization (ACO) may also affect spending and quality of care for another insurer's enrollees served by the ACO. Such spillover effects reflect the extent of organizational efforts to reform care delivery and can contribute to the net impact of ACOs. OBJECTIVE: We examined whether the Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) of Massachusetts' Alternative Quality Contract (AQC), an early commercial ACO initiative associated with reduced spending and improved quality for BCBS enrollees, was also associated with changes in spending and quality for Medicare beneficiaries, who were not covered by the AQC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Quasi-experimental comparisons from 2007-2010 of elderly fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries in Massachusetts (1,761,325 person-years) served by 11 provider organizations entering the AQC in 2009 or 2010 (intervention group) vs beneficiaries served by other providers (control group). Using a difference-in-differences approach, we estimated changes in spending and quality for the intervention group in the first and second years of exposure to the AQC relative to concurrent changes for the control group. Regression and propensity score methods were used to adjust for differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was total quarterly medical spending per beneficiary. Secondary outcomes included spending by setting and type of service, 5 process measures of quality, potentially avoidable hospitalizations, and 30-day readmissions. RESULTS: Before entering the AQC, total quarterly spending per beneficiary for the intervention group was $150 (95% CI, $25-$274) higher than for the control group and increased at a similar rate. In year 2 of the intervention group's exposure to the AQC, this difference was reduced to $51 (95% CI, -$109 to $210; P = .53), constituting a significant differential change of -$99 (95% CI, -$183 to -$16; P = .02) or a 3.4% savings relative to an expected quarterly mean of $2895. Savings in year 1 were not significant (differential change, -$34; 95% CI, -$83 to $16; P = .18). Year 2 savings derived largely from lower spending on outpatient care (differential change, -$73; 95% CI, -$97 to -$50; P < .001), particularly for beneficiaries with 5 or more conditions, and included significant differential changes in spending on procedures, imaging, and tests. Annual rates of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol testing differentially improved for beneficiaries with diabetes in the intervention group by 3.1 percentage points (95% CI, 1.4-4.8 percentage points; P < .001) and for those with cardiovascular disease by 2.5 percentage points (95% CI, 1.1-4.0 percentage points; P < .001), but performance on other quality measures did not differentially change. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The AQC was associated with lower spending for Medicare beneficiaries but not with consistently improved quality. Savings among Medicare beneficiaries and previously demonstrated savings among BCBS enrollees varied similarly across settings, services, and time, suggesting that organizational responses were associated with broad changes in patient care.","Accountable Care Organizations/*economics Aged Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance Plans/economics Case-Control Studies Commerce Fee-for-Service Plans Female Health Expenditures/*trends Humans Male Massachusetts Medicare/*economics *Patient Care/economics/standards *Quality Improvement Reimbursement, Incentive/economics United States"
23733179,Reducing racial/ethnic disparities in childhood obesity: the role of early life risk factors.,JAMA Pediatr,Taveras EM and Gillman MW and Kleinman KP and Rich-Edwards JW and Rifas-Shiman SL,partners,"IMPORTANCE Many early life risk factors for childhood obesity are more prevalent among blacks and Hispanics than among whites and may explain the higher prevalence of obesity among racial/ethnic minority children. OBJECTIVE To examine the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities in adiposity and overweight are explained by differences in risk factors during pregnancy (gestational diabetes and depression), infancy (rapid infant weight gain, feeding other than exclusive breastfeeding, and early introduction of solid foods), and early childhood (sleeping &lt;12 h/d, presence of a television set in the room where the child sleeps, and any intake of sugar-sweetened beverages or fast food). DESIGN Prospective prebirth cohort study. SETTING Multisite group practice in Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS Participants included 1116 mother-child pairs (63% white, 17% black, and 4% Hispanic) EXPOSURE Mother's report of child's race/ethnicity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) z score, total fat mass index from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and overweight or obesity, defined as a BMI in the 85th percentile or higher at age 7 years. RESULTS Black (0.48 U [95% CI, 0.31 to 0.64]) and Hispanic (0.43 [0.12 to 0.74]) children had higher BMI z scores, as well as higher total fat mass index and overweight/obesity prevalence, than white children. After adjustment for socioeconomic confounders and parental BMI, differences in BMI z score were attenuated for black and Hispanic children (0.22 U [0.05 to 0.40] and 0.22 U [-0.08 to 0.52], respectively). Adjustment for pregnancy risk factors did not substantially change these estimates. However, after further adjustment for infancy and childhood risk factors, we observed only minimal differences in BMI z scores between whites, blacks (0.07 U [-0.11 to 0.26]), and Hispanics (0.04 U [-0.27 to 0.35]). We observed similar attenuation of racial/ethnic differences in adiposity and prevalence of overweight or obesity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Racial/ethnic disparities in childhood adiposity and obesity are determined by factors operating in infancy and early childhood. Efforts to reduce obesity disparities should focus on preventing early life risk factors.","*African Americans Age Factors Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies *European Continental Ancestry Group Female *Health Status Disparities *Hispanic Americans Humans Infant Male Obesity/*epidemiology/*prevention & control Prospective Studies Risk Factors United States"
23699900,Impact of specific medical interventions in early childhood on increasing the prevalence of later intellectual disability.,JAMA Pediatr,Brosco JP and Sanders LM and Dowling M and Guez G,miami,"IMPORTANCE: For the past 100 years, medicine in industrialized nations has become increasingly focused on specific medical interventions designed to improve the health of individual patients. Substantial evidence suggests that broader improvements in public health, nutrition, and economic well-being are more salient than medical or surgical interventions for the remarkable decrease in infant and child deaths since 1900. Less is known about the impact of specific medical interventions on morbidity such as intellectual disability (ID). OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of medical interventions in early childhood on increasing the prevalence of later ID, as reported in the literature from 1950 through 2000. DESIGN: We reviewed the medical literature and other data from 1950 through 2000 to construct estimates of the condition-specific prevalence of ID over time. We further explored the existing literature to document historically relevant influences on condition-specific prevalence, including the introduction of effective interventions, the timing of these introductions, and the likelihood of their widespread use. SETTING: Twentieth century United States and Western Europe. PARTICIPANTS: Populations of children who received a life-saving intervention within the first 5 years of life and were evaluated for ID after 5 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Case-specific prevalence of ID from 1950 through 2000. RESULTS: Low birth weight is associated with approximately 10% to 15% of the total prevalence of ID. No other new medical therapies introduced during this period were associated with a clinically significant increase in ID prevalence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Previous research has shown that specific medical interventions, such as newborn screening for congenital thyroid deficiency and phenylketonuria, have decreased the prevalence of ID approximately 16% in the United States since 1950. These results suggest that other medical interventions, particularly the advent of intensive care technologies, have also increased the prevalence of ID.","Child Child, Preschool Critical Care/*methods/trends Europe/epidemiology Humans Infant Infant, Low Birth Weight Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature Infant, Premature, Diseases/epidemiology/etiology/therapy Intellectual Disability/epidemiology/*etiology Intensive Care, Neonatal/methods/trends Prevalence United States/epidemiology"

This study uses the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry to determine whether tonsillectomy or other surgical procedures prior to radiotherapy have an impact on outcome. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate whether tonsillectomy adds oncologic advantage over biopsy alone in stage I or II tonsil cancers prior to definitive radiotherapy. DESIGN: Retrospective study of the SEER program. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 524 patients with stage I and II primary tonsil carcinoma diagnosed during the period 1988 through 2006 who received definitive radiation treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hazard ratios, 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS), 5-year overall survival (OS), and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Subgroup univariate and multivariate analysis of survival compared the following variables: sex, T category (T1 vs T2), year of diagnosis (1988-2003 vs 2004-2006), and surgical status (preradiation tonsillectomy vs biopsy only). A log-rank test compared Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for the surgical status subgroups. RESULTS Statistically significant contributors to survival (DSS and OS) included age (P < .001, DSS), surgical status (P = .001, DSS), and year of diagnosis (P = .02, DSS). Treatment with radiation after tonsillectomy yielded a 5-year OS of 83% (95% CI, 77%-88%) and a 5-year DSS of 90% (95% CI, 84%-93%). This compares with an OS of 64% (95% CI, 54%-71%) and DSS of 76% (95% CI, 68%-82%) for radiation therapy after biopsy alone. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: SEER data suggest that tonsil resection prior to radiation therapy is associated with improved survival in low-stage tonsil cancer. Although selection bias is a likely factor in this analysis, the effect remains after controlling for age and year of treatment.","Adult Aged Female Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged Morbidity/trends *Neoplasm Staging Radiotherapy, Adjuvant Retrospective Studies *SEER Program Survival Rate/trends Tonsillar Neoplasms/epidemiology/radiotherapy/*surgery *Tonsillectomy Treatment Outcome United States/epidemiology"
23364679,Potential of pretreatment neural activity in the visual cortex during emotional processing to predict treatment response to scopolamine in major depressive disorder.,JAMA Psychiatry,Furey ML and Drevets WC and Hoffman EM and Frankel E and Speer AM and Zarate CA Jr,nih,"CONTEXT: The need for improved treatment options for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) is critical. Faster-acting antidepressants and biomarkers that predict clinical response will facilitate treatment. Scopolamine produces rapid antidepressant effects and thus offers the opportunity to characterize potential biomarkers of treatment response within short periods. OBJECTIVE: To determine if baseline brain activity when processing emotional information can predict treatment response to scopolamine in MDD. DESIGN: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study together with repeated functional magnetic resonance imaging, acquired as participants performed face-identity and face-emotion working memory tasks. SETTING: National Institute of Mental Health Division of Intramural Research Programs. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen currently depressed outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for recurrent MDD and 21 healthy participants, between 18 and 55 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The magnitude of treatment response to scopolamine (percentage of change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score between study end and baseline) was correlated with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal associated with each working memory component (encode, maintenance, and test) for both identity and emotion tasks. Treatment response also was correlated with change in BOLD response (scopolamine vs baseline). Baseline activity was compared between healthy and MDD groups. RESULTS: Baseline BOLD response in the bilateral middle occipital cortex, selectively during the stimulus-processing components of the emotion working memory task (no correlation during the identity task), correlated with treatment response magnitude. Change in BOLD response following scopolamine administration in overlapping areas in the middle occipital cortex while performing the same task conditions also correlated with clinical response. Healthy controls showed higher activity in the same visual regions than patients with MDD during baseline. CONCLUSION: These results implicate cholinergic and visual processing dysfunction in the pathophysiology of MDD and suggest that neural response in the visual cortex, selectively to emotional stimuli, may provide a useful biomarker for identifying patients who will respond favorably to scopolamine.

It is considered a feature of skin aging, but risk factors other than aging are largely unknown. OBJECTIVE To study nongenetic and genetic risk factors for sagging eyelids. DESIGN Upper eyelid sagging was graded in 4 categories of severity using digital photographs. Dermatochalasis was defined as the eyelid hanging over the eyelashes. Age, sex, skin color, tanning ability, hormonal status in women, current smoking, body mass index, and sun protection behavior were analyzed in a multivariable multinomial logistic regression model. Genetic predisposition was assessed using heritability analysis and a genome-wide association study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS The study was performed in 2 independent population-based cohorts. The Rotterdam Study included older adults from one district in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and the UK Adult Twin Registry (TwinsUK) included twins from all over the United Kingdom. Participants were 5578 unrelated Dutch Europeans (mean age, 67.1 years; 44.0% male) from the Rotterdam Study and 2186 twins (mean age, 53.1 years; 10.4% male) from the TwinsUK. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sagging eyelid severity levels, ranging from 1 (normal control) to 4 (severe sagging). RESULTS Among 5578 individuals from the Rotterdam Study, 17.8% showed dermatochalasis (moderate and severe sagging eyelids). Significant and independent risk factors for sagging eyelids included age, male sex, lighter skin color, and higher body mass index. In addition, current smoking was borderline significantly associated. Heritability of sagging eyelids was estimated to be 61% among 1052 twin pairs from the TwinsUK (15.6% showed dermatochalasis). A meta-analysis of genome-wide association study results from 5578 Rotterdam Study and 1053 TwinsUK participants showed a genome-wide significant recessive protective effect of the C allele of rs11876749 (P = 1.7 x 10-8). This variant is located close to TGIF1 (an inducer of transforming growth factor beta), which is a known gene associated with skin aging. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This is the first observational study to date demonstrating that other risk factors (male sex, genetic variants, lighter skin color, high body mass index, and possibly current smoking) in addition to aging are involved in the origin of sagging eyelids.",Missing
23986353,"Comparative mortality risk in adult patients with schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder participating in psychopharmacology clinical trials.",JAMA Psychiatry,Khan A and Faucett J and Morrison S and Brown WA,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: There is concern that increased mortality risk among patients with psychiatric illness may be worsened by psychopharmacological agents. OBJECTIVES: To assess mortality risk among adult patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder participating in clinical trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market and to evaluate if psychopharmacological agents worsen this risk. DATA SOURCES: The FDA Summary Basis of Approval (SBA) reports of new drug applications and supplemental applications for 28 psychopharmacological agents approved between 1990 and 2011. STUDY SELECTION: The FDA SBA reports detailing exposure data from acute placebo-controlled trials and safety extension studies including 92,542 patients from 47 adult drug approval programs for treatment of schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and SBA reports on combination and maintenance therapy programs for treatments of bipolar disorder. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We reviewed and synthesized mortality data from SBA reports that combined mortality rates across the clinical trials, including information on patient exposure years (PEY) for active treatments and placebo for individual indications. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall mortality rate per 100,000 PEY in relation to the psychiatric diagnosis of the patients participating in psychopharmacology clinical trials. Also, the overall mortality rates using PEY technique among patients assigned to psychopharmacological agents or placebo were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, mortality risk was high and significantly associated with psychiatric diagnosis (chi(2)(4) = 1760; P < .001). Compared with the general adult population, patients with schizophrenia had the highest mortality risk (3.8-fold increase), followed by patients with depression (3.15-fold increase) and bipolar disorder (3.0-fold increase). The mortality risk was not increased when patients were assigned to psychotropic agents rather than placebo except for heterocyclic antidepressants. Suicide accounted for 109 of all 265 deaths (41.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data suggest that increased mortality rates reported in population studies are detectable among adult patients with psychiatric illnesses participating in psychopharmacological trials. Furthermore, 3- to 4-month exposure to modern psychotropic agents, such as atypical antipsychotic agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors does not worsen this risk. Given the inherent limitations of the FDA SBA reports, further research is needed to support firm conclusions.",Adult Age Factors Aged Clinical Trials as Topic/*adverse effects Female Humans Male Mental Disorders/*mortality Middle Aged Psychotropic Drugs/*adverse effects Risk Factors Suicide/statistics & numerical data United States/epidemiology

Previous studies have reported on the behaviors of BRCA mutation carriers, but less is known about the behaviors of non- BRCA carriers. We surveyed a large cohort of women after BRCA testing to identify the prevalence and posttest predictors of risk-reducing and screening interventions. METHODS: A median of 3.7 years after BRCA testing, 1447 women who received genetic counseling and BRCA testing at 2 hospital sites were surveyed, with a 77.6% response rate. We analyzed data from 1077 survey respondents. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify predictors of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), screening transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS), and screening serum cancer antigen 125 (CA-125). RESULTS: Among the respondents, 201 women (18.7%) received positive test results for a deleterious mutation, 103 women (9.6%) received true-negative results, and 773 women (71.8%) received uninformative results. Overall, 19.1% of eligible women underwent RRSO and 39.6% used screening procedures. A positive BRCA result predicted RRSO (odds ratio [OR], 28.1; 95% CI, 16.2-48.6), TVUS (9.5 [4.3-21.0]), and serum CA-125 (13.0 [5.5-29.0]). Similarly, a true-negative BRCA result reduced the OR for RRSO (0.1 [0.0-0.6]), TVUS (0.2 [0.1-0.5]), and serum CA-125 (0.3 [0.1-0.7]). Of the 71.8% of women who received uninformative results after BRCA testing, 12.3% subsequently underwent RRSO, 33.8% reported ever having undergone screening serum CA-125 since BRCA testing, and 37.3% reported ever having undergone screening TVUS since BRCA testing. CONCLUSIONS: Results of BRCA testing strongly predict RRSO and ovarian cancer screening. Use of RRSO and ovarian screening was reported in a sizable percentage of non- BRCA carriers despite insufficient data to determine the effectiveness of these interventions.","Adult CA-125 Antigen/blood Female *Genes, BRCA1 *Genes, BRCA2 Humans Mass Screening/*statistics & numerical data Middle Aged Ovarian Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/prevention & control Ovariectomy/*statistics & numerical data Risk Factors Salpingectomy/*statistics & numerical data"

However, analyses of the surgery impact have not been updated and comprehensively investigated since 2003. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness and risks of bariatric surgery using up-to-date, comprehensive data and appropriate meta-analytic techniques. DATA SOURCES: Literature searches of Medline, Embase, Scopus, Current Contents, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov between 2003 and 2012 were performed. STUDY SELECTION: Exclusion criteria included publication of abstracts only, case reports, letters, comments, or reviews; animal studies; languages other than English; duplicate studies; no surgical intervention; and no population of interest. Inclusion criteria were a report of surgical procedure performed and at least 1 outcome of interest resulting from the studied surgery was reported: comorbidities, mortality, complications, reoperations, or weight loss. Of the 25,060 initially identified articles, 24,023 studies met the exclusion criteria, and 259 met the inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A review protocol was followed throughout. Three reviewers independently reviewed studies, abstracted data, and resolved disagreements by consensus. Studies were evaluated for quality. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mortality, complications, reoperations, weight loss, and remission of obesity-related diseases. RESULTS: A total of 164 studies were included (37 randomized clinical trials and 127 observational studies). Analyses included 161,756 patients with a mean age of 44.56 years and body mass index of 45.62. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses and meta-regression. In randomized clinical trials, the mortality rate within 30 days was 0.08% (95% CI, 0.01%-0.24%); the mortality rate after 30 days was 0.31% (95% CI, 0.01%-0.75%). Body mass index loss at 5 years postsurgery was 12 to 17. The complication rate was 17% (95% CI, 11%-23%), and the reoperation rate was 7% (95% CI, 3%-12%). Gastric bypass was more effective in weight loss but associated with more complications. Adjustable gastric banding had lower mortality and complication rates; yet, the reoperation rate was higher and weight loss was less substantial than gastric bypass. Sleeve gastrectomy appeared to be more effective in weight loss than adjustable gastric banding and comparable with gastric bypass. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Bariatric surgery provides substantial and sustained effects on weight loss and ameliorates obesity-attributable comorbidities in the majority of bariatric patients, although risks of complication, reoperation, and death exist.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of a screening program using brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and collaborative care in an at-risk population in reducing newly diagnosed heart failure and prevalence of significant left ventricular (LV) systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The St Vincent's Screening to Prevent Heart Failure Study, a parallel-group randomized trial involving 1374 participants with cardiovascular risk factors (mean age, 64.8 [SD, 10.2] years) recruited from 39 primary care practices in Ireland between January 2005 and December 2009 and followed up until December 2011 (mean follow-up, 4.2 [SD, 1.2] years). INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive usual primary care (control condition; n=677) or screening with BNP testing (n=697). Intervention-group participants with BNP levels of 50 pg/mL or higher underwent echocardiography and collaborative care between their primary care physician and specialist cardiovascular service. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was prevalence of asymptomatic LV dysfunction with or without newly diagnosed heart failure. Secondary end points included emergency hospitalization for arrhythmia, transient ischemic attack, stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral or pulmonary thrombosis/embolus, or heart failure. RESULTS: A total of 263 patients (41.6%) in the intervention group had at least 1 BNP reading of 50 pg/mL or higher.

Heart failure occurred in 14 (2.1%) of 677 control-group patients and 7 (1.0%) of 697 intervention-group patients (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.20-1.20; P = .12). The incidence rates of emergency hospitalization for major cardiovascular events were 40.4 per 1000 patient-years in the control group vs 22.3 per 1000 patient-years in the intervention group (incidence rate ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45-0.81; P = .002). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients at risk of heart failure, BNP-based screening and collaborative care reduced the combined rates of LV systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, and heart failure.

23392319,Pediatric intracerebral hemorrhage: acute symptomatic seizures and epilepsy.,JAMA Neurol,Beslow LA and Abend NS and Gindville MC and Bastian RA and Licht DJ and Smith SE and Hillis AE and Ichord RN and Jordan LC,yale,"IMPORTANCE: Seizures are believed to be common presenting symptoms in neonates and children with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, few data are available on the epidemiology of acute symptomatic seizures or the risk for later epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: To define the incidence of and explore risk factors for seizures and epilepsy in children with spontaneous ICH. Our a priori hypotheses were that younger age at presentation, cortical involvement of ICH, acute symptomatic seizures after presentation, ICH due to vascular malformation, and elevated intracranial pressure requiring urgent intervention would predict remote symptomatic seizures and epilepsy. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study conducted between March 1, 2007, and January 1, 2012. SETTING: Three tertiary care pediatric hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-three pediatric subjects with spontaneous ICH including 20 perinatal (>/=37 weeks' gestation to 28 days) and 53 childhood subjects (>28 days to <18 years at presentation). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute symptomatic seizures (clinically evident and electrographic-only seizures within 7 days), remote symptomatic seizures, and epilepsy. RESULTS: Acute symptomatic seizures occurred in 35 subjects (48%). Acute symptomatic seizures as a presenting symptom of ICH occurred in 12 perinatal (60%) and 19 childhood (36%) subjects (P = .07). Acute symptomatic seizures after presentation occurred in 7 children. Electrographic-only seizures were present in 9 of 32 subjects (28%) with continuous electroencephalogram monitoring. One-year and 2-year remote symptomatic seizure-free survival rates were 82% (95% CI, 68-90) and 67% (95% CI, 46-82), respectively. One-year and 2-year epilepsy-free survival rates were 96% (95% CI, 83-99) and 87% (95% CI, 65-95), respectively. Elevated intracranial pressure requiring acute intervention was a risk factor for seizures after presentation (P = .01; Fisher exact test), remote symptomatic seizures, and epilepsy (P = .03, and P = .04, respectively; log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Presenting seizures are common in perinatal and childhood ICH. Continuous electroencephalography may detect electrographic seizures in some subjects. Single remote symptomatic seizures occur in many, and development of epilepsy is estimated to occur in 13% of patients at 2 years. Elevated intracranial pressure requiring acute intervention is a risk factor for acute seizures after presentation, remote symptomatic seizures, and epilepsy.","Adolescent Age Factors Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use Cerebral Hemorrhage/*epidemiology/mortality/radiography Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Electroencephalography Epilepsy/drug therapy/*epidemiology/mortality/radiography Female Hospitals, Pediatric Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Risk Factors Seizures/drug therapy/*epidemiology/mortality/radiography Statistics, Nonparametric"

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate sex differences in ACS presentation and to estimate associations between sex, sociodemographic, gender identity, psychosocial and clinical factors, markers of coronary disease severity, and absence of chest pain in young patients with ACS. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 1015 patients (30% women) 55 years or younger, hospitalized for ACS and enrolled in the GENESIS PRAXY (Gender and Sex Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease: From Bench to Beyond Premature Acute Coronary Syndrome) study (January 2009-September 2012). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The McSweeney Acute and Prodromal Myocardial Infarction Symptom Survey was administered during hospitalization. RESULTS: The median age for both sexes was 49 years. Women were more likely to have non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (37.5 vs 30.7; P = .03) and present without chest pain compared with men (19.0% vs 13.7%; P = .03). Patients without chest pain reported fewer symptoms overall and no discernable pattern of non-chest pain symptoms was found. In the multivariate model, being a woman (odds ratio [OR], 1.95 [95% CI, 1.23-3.11]; P = .005) and tachycardia (OR, 2.07 [95% CI, 1.20-3.56]; P = .009) were independently associated with ACS presentation without chest pain. Patients without chest pain did not differ significantly from those with chest pain in terms of ACS type, troponin level elevation, or coronary stenosis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Chest pain was the most common ACS symptom in both sexes. Although women were more likely to present without chest pain than men, absence of chest pain was not associated with markers of coronary disease severity. Strategies that explicitly incorporate assessment of common non-chest pain symptoms need to be evaluated.",Acute Coronary Syndrome/complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology Age Factors Canada/epidemiology Chest Pain/*epidemiology/etiology Comorbidity Female Gender Identity Humans Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies *Sex Characteristics Socioeconomic Factors
25029432,Changing Patterns of In-Hospital Deaths Following Implementation of Damage Control Resuscitation Practices in US Forward Military Treatment Facilities.,JAMA Surg,Langan NR and Eckert M and Martin MJ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Analysis of combat deaths provides invaluable epidemiologic and quality-improvement data for trauma centers and is particularly important under rapidly evolving battlefield conditions. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the evolution of injury patterns, early care, and resuscitation among patients who subsequently died in the hospital, before and after implementation of damage control resuscitation (DCR) policies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a review of the Joint Theater Trauma Registry (2002-2011) of US forward combat hospitals, cohorts of patients with vital signs at presentation and subsequent in-hospital death were grouped into 2 time periods: pre-DCR (before 2006) and DCR (2006-2011). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Injury types and Injury Severity Scores (ISSs), timing and location of death, and initial (24-hour) and total volume of blood products and fluid administered. RESULTS: Of 57 179 soldiers admitted to a forward combat hospital, 2565 (4.5%) subsequently died in the hospital. The majority of patients (74%) were severely injured (ISS > 15), and 80% died within 24 hours of admission. Damage control resuscitation policies were widely implemented by 2006 and resulted in a decrease in mean 24-hour crystalloid infusion volume (6.1-3.2 L) and increased fresh frozen plasma use (3.2-10.1 U) (both P < .05) in this population. The mean packed red blood cells to fresh frozen plasma ratio changed from 2.6:1 during the pre-DCR period to 1.4:1 during the DCR period (P < .01). There was a significant increase in mean ISS between cohorts (pre-DCR ISS = 23 vs DCR ISS = 27; P < .05) and a marked shift in injury patterns favoring more severe head trauma in the DCR cohort. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There has been a significant shift in resuscitation practices in forward combat hospitals indicating widespread military adoption of DCR. Patients who died in a hospital during the DCR period were more likely to be severely injured and have a severe brain injury, consistent with a decrease in deaths among potentially salvageable patients.",Missing
23128676,Prevalence and predictors of smoking by inpatients during a hospital stay.,Arch Intern Med,Regan S and Viana JC and Reyen M and Rigotti NA,partners,"BACKGROUND: Accredited US hospitals prohibit smoking inside hospital buildings. Patients are expected to abstain from smoking throughout their hospitalization, but how many do so is unclear. Smoking by inpatients may compromise patient safety, clinical outcomes, and hospital efficiency. METHODS: We conducted an observational study of adult cigarette smokers visited by a tobacco counselor while hospitalized and reached for telephone follow-up in the 2 weeks after discharge. We assessed smoking during the hospital stay at the time of counseling for all patients and at follow-up for those reached. We used generalized linear models to estimate adjusted relative risk (ARR) for smoking while hospitalized, adjusted by patient and admission characteristics. RESULTS: From May 1, 2007, through April 31, 2010, counselors visited 5399 smokers, of whom 14.9% had smoked between admission and the visit. Of 3555 eligible smokers who consented to follow-up, 2185 were reached. Smoking at any time during the hospitalization was reported by 18.4%, less often during winter months than the rest of the year (14.4% vs 19.7%, P = .007). Smoking at any time while hospitalized was less common among those 50 years or older (ARR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.88), those admitted to a cardiac unit (0.64; 0.51-0.81), and those intending to quit after discharge (0.46; 0.34-0.63) and more common among those with longer stays (1.36; 1.14-1.62) and those experiencing cigarette cravings (moderate: 1.23; 1.14-1.33; severe: 1.25; 1.18-1.34). Nicotine replacement therapy ordered the day of admission was associated with less smoking before the counselor's visit (ARR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.96) but not for the entire hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one-fifth of smokers admitted to a smoke-free hospital smoked during their hospital stay. Ordering nicotine replacement therapy routinely at admission and ongoing monitoring of patients' cigarette cravings might reduce smoking among admitted patients.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Female Humans Inpatients/psychology/*statistics & numerical data Length of Stay Male Middle Aged Patient Safety Predictive Value of Tests Prevalence Smoking/*epidemiology/psychology Smoking Cessation/*psychology"
23649656,Provision of spiritual support to patients with advanced cancer by religious communities and associations with medical care at the end of life.,JAMA Intern Med,Balboni TA and Balboni M and Enzinger AC and Gallivan K and Paulk ME and Wright A and Steinhauser K and VanderWeele TJ and Prigerson HG,harvard,"IMPORTANCE: Previous studies report associations between medical utilization at the end-of-life (EoL) and religious coping and spiritual support from the medical team. However, the influence of clergy and religious communities on EoL outcomes is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether spiritual support from religious communities influences terminally ill patients' medical care and quality of life (QoL) near death. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A US-based, multisite cohort study of 343 patients with advanced cancer enrolled from September 2002 through August 2008 and followed up (median duration, 116 days) until death. Baseline interviews assessed support of patients' spiritual needs by religious communities. End-of-life medical care in the final week included the following: hospice, aggressive EoL measures (care in an intensive care unit [ICU], resuscitation, or ventilation), and ICU death. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: End-of-life QoL was assessed by caregiver ratings of patient QoL in the last week of life. Multivariable regression analyses were performed on EoL care outcomes in relation to religious community spiritual support, controlling for confounding variables, and were repeated among high religious coping and racial/ethnic minority patients. RESULTS: Patients reporting high spiritual support from religious communities (43%) were less likely to receive hospice (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.20-0.70 [P = .002]), more likely to receive aggressive EoL measures (AOR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.14-6.06 [P = .02]), and more likely to die in an ICU (AOR, 5.22; 95% CI, 1.71-15.60 [P = .004]). Risks of receiving aggressive EoL interventions and ICU deaths were greater among high religious coping (AOR, 11.02; 95% CI, 2.83-42.89 [P < .001]; and AOR, 22.02; 95% CI, 3.24-149.58 [P = .002]; respectively) and racial/ethnic minority patients (AOR, 8.03; 95% CI, 2.04-31.55 [P = .003]; and AOR, 11.21; 95% CI, 2.29-54.88 [P = .003]; respectively). Among patients well-supported by religious communities, receiving spiritual support from the medical team was associated with higher rates of hospice use (AOR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.03-5.44 [P = .04]), fewer aggressive interventions (AOR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06-0.79 [P = .02]) and fewer ICU deaths (AOR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.80 [P = .02]); and EoL discussions were associated with fewer aggressive interventions (AOR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.63 [P = .01]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Terminally ill patients who are well supported by religious communities access hospice care less and aggressive medical interventions more near death. Spiritual care and EoL discussions by the medical team may reduce aggressive treatment, highlighting spiritual care as a key component of EoL medical care guidelines.","Adaptation, Psychological Advance Care Planning/statistics & numerical data Aged Cohort Studies Female Follow-Up Studies Hospice Care/statistics & numerical data Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplasms/diagnosis/mortality/*psychology/*therapy Palliative Care/psychology/*statistics & numerical data *Quality of Life/psychology Questionnaires *Religion Sampling Studies Severity of Illness Index Spirituality Terminal Care/psychology/*statistics & numerical data United States/epidemiology"

23462787,Prevalence of regional myocardial thinning and relationship with myocardial scarring in patients with coronary artery disease.,JAMA,Shah DJ and Kim HW and James O and Parker M and Wu E and Bonow RO and Judd RM and Kim RJ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Regional left ventricular (LV) wall thinning is believed to represent chronic transmural myocardial infarction and scar tissue. However, recent case reports using delayed-enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging raise the possibility that thinning may occur with little or no scarring. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patients with regional myocardial wall thinning and to determine scar burden and potential for functional improvement. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Investigator-initiated, prospective, 3-center study conducted from August 2000 through January 2008 in 3 parts to determine (1) in patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing CMR viability assessment, the prevalence of regional wall thinning (end-diastolic wall thickness </=5.5 mm), (2) in patients with thinning, the presence and extent of scar burden, and (3) in patients with thinning undergoing coronary revascularization, any changes in myocardial morphology and contractility. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Scar burden in thinned regions assessed using delayed-enhancement CMR and changes in myocardial morphology and function assessed using cine-CMR after revascularization. RESULTS: Of 1055 consecutive patients with CAD screened, 201 (19% [95% CI, 17% to 21%]) had regional wall thinning. Wall thinning spanned a mean of 34% (95% CI, 32% to 37% [SD, 15%]) of LV surface area. Within these regions, the extent of scarring was 72% (95% CI, 69% to 76% [SD, 25%]); however, 18% (95% CI, 13% to 24%) of thinned regions had limited scar burden (</=50% of total extent). Among patients with thinning undergoing revascularization and follow-up cine-CMR (n = 42), scar extent within the thinned region was inversely related to regional (r = -0.72, P < .001) and global (r = -0.53, P < .001) contractile improvement. End-diastolic wall thickness in thinned regions with limited scar burden increased from 4.4 mm (95% CI, 4.1 to 4.7) to 7.5 mm (95% CI, 6.9 to 8.1) after revascularization (P < .001), resulting in resolution of wall thinning. On multivariable analysis, scar extent had the strongest association with contractile improvement (slope coefficient, -0.03 [95% CI, -0.04 to -0.02]; P < .001) and reversal of thinning (slope coefficient, -0.05 [95% CI, -0.06 to -0.04]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with CAD referred for CMR and found to have regional wall thinning, limited scar burden was present in 18% and was associated with improved contractility and resolution of wall thinning after revascularization.

23598992,Treatment patterns and survival among low-income medicaid patients with head and neck cancer.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Subramanian S and Chen A,rti,"IMPORTANCE: Medicaid beneficiaries by definition are low income but they are not necessarily a homogeneous group. No study has assessed differences and disparities among Medicaid beneficiaries with head and neck cancers. OBJECTIVE: To examine predictors of treatment receipt and mortality among Medicaid patients with head and neck cancer. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using Medicaid claims linked with cancer registry data for 2 states, California and Georgia, for the years 2002 through 2006. SETTING: Inpatient and ambulatory care. PARTICIPANTS: Medicaid beneficiaries aged 18 to 64 years diagnosed as having head and neck cancer (N = 1308) were included. Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression models analyzed the likelihood of treatment receipt and survival. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Receipt of treatment and 12- and 24-month mortality. RESULTS: Fewer than one-third of Medicaid patients with cancer received a diagnosis at an early stage. Overall, black patients were less likely to get surgical treatment and more likely to die than white patients, even after controlling for demographics, stage at diagnosis, and tumor site. Older age and disability status also increased 12-month mortality. Patients in California, who were alive for at least 12 months, have approximately half the odds of dying within 24 months compared with those in Georgia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Concrete steps should be taken to address the significant racial disparities observed in head and neck cancer outcomes among Medicaid beneficiaries. Further research is needed to explore the state-level policies and attributes to examine the startling differences in mortality among the state Medicaid programs analyzed in this study. Pooled comparisons of Medicaid beneficiaries with individuals covered by other types of insurance could mask important disparities among Medicaid beneficiaries, which need to be acknowledged and addressed to improve outcomes for these low-income patients with head and neck cancer.","Adolescent Adult African Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data California Cohort Studies Combined Modality Therapy Confidence Intervals Databases, Factual Early Diagnosis European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Female Georgia Head and Neck Neoplasms/diagnosis/*mortality/*therapy Health Services Accessibility/*economics/statistics & numerical data Healthcare Disparities/*economics/ethnology Humans Logistic Models Male Medicaid/*economics/statistics & numerical data Middle Aged Needs Assessment Odds Ratio Poverty Prognosis Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Socioeconomic Factors Survival Analysis Treatment Outcome United States Young Adult"
23699646,Effects of creative arts therapies on psychological symptoms and quality of life in patients with cancer.,JAMA Intern Med,Puetz TW and Morley CA and Herring MP,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Creative arts therapies (CATs) can reduce anxiety, depression, pain, and fatigue and increase quality of life (QOL) in patients with cancer. However, no systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the effects of CAT on psychological symptoms among cancer patients has been conducted. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effect of CAT on psychological symptoms and QOL in cancer patients during treatment and follow-up and to determine whether the effect varied according to patient, intervention, and design characteristics. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched ERIC, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, PubMed, and Web of Science from database inception to January 2012. Studies included RCTs in which cancer patients were randomized to a CAT or control condition and anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue and/or QOL were measured pre- and post-intervention. Twenty-seven studies involving 1576 patients were included. We extracted data on effect sizes, moderators, and study quality. Hedges d effect sizes were computed, and random-effects models were used to estimate sampling error and population variance. FINDINGS: During treatment, CAT significantly reduced anxiety (Delta = 0.28 [95% CI, 0.11-0.44]), depression (Delta = 0.23 [0.05-0.40]), and pain (Delta = 0.54 [0.33-0.75]) and increased QOL (Delta = 0.50 [0.25-0.74]). Pain was significantly reduced during follow-up (Delta = 0.59 [95% CI, 0.42-0.77]). Anxiety reductions were strongest for studies in which (1) a non-CAT therapist administered the intervention compared with studies that used a creative arts therapist and (2) a waiting-list or usual-care comparison was used. Pain reductions were largest during inpatient treatment and for homogeneous cancer groups in outpatient settings; significantly smaller reductions occurred in heterogeneous groups in outpatient settings.

24522374,The reliability of teledermatology to triage inpatient dermatology consultations.,JAMA Dermatol,Barbieri JS and Nelson CA and James WD and Margolis DJ and Littman-Quinn R and Kovarik CL and Rosenbach M,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Many hospitals do not have inpatient dermatologic consultative services, and most have reduced availability of services during off-hours. Dermatologists based in outpatient settings can find it challenging to determine the urgency with which they need to evaluate inpatients when consultations are requested. Teledermatology may provide a valuable mechanism for dermatologists to triage inpatient consultations and increase efficiency, thereby expanding access to specialized care for hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a store-and-forward teledermatology system is reliable for the initial triage of inpatient dermatology consultations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study of 50 consenting adult patients, hospitalized for any indication, for whom an inpatient dermatology consultation was requested between September 1, 2012, and April 31, 2013, at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, an academic medical center. The participants were evaluated separately by both an in-person dermatologist and 2 independent teledermatologists. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary study outcomes were the initial triage and decision to biopsy concordance between in-person and teledermatology evaluations. RESULTS: Triage decisions were as follows: if the in-person dermatologist recommended the patient be seen the same day, the teledermatologist agreed in 90% of the consultations. If the in-person dermatologist recommended a biopsy, the teledermatologist agreed in 95% of cases on average. When the teledermatologist did not choose the same course of action, there was substantial diagnostic agreement between the teledermatologist and the in-person dermatologist. The Kendall tau rank correlation coefficients for initial triage concordance between the in-person dermatologist and teledermatologists were 0.41 and 0.48. The Cohen kappa coefficients for decision to biopsy concordance were 0.35 and 0.61. The teledermatologists were able to triage 60% of consultations to be seen the next day or later. The teledermatologists were able to triage, on average, 10% of patients to be seen as outpatients after discharge.

23877630,Appropriate use and clinical impact of transthoracic echocardiography.,JAMA Intern Med,Matulevicius SA and Rohatgi A and Das SR and Price AL and DeLuna A and Reimold SC,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) accounts for almost half of all cardiac imaging services and is a widely available and versatile tool. Appropriate use criteria (AUC) for echocardiography were developed to improve patient care and health outcomes. Prior studies have shown that most TTEs are appropriate by AUC. However, the associations among TTE, AUC, and their clinical impact have not been well explored. OBJECTIVES: To describe the proportion of TTEs that affect clinical care in an academic medical center overall and in subgroups defined as appropriate and inappropriate by AUC. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective review of medical records from 535 consecutive TTEs at an academic medical center was performed. The TTEs were classified according to 2011 AUC by 2 cardiologists blinded to clinical impact and were assessed for clinical impact by 2 cardiologists blinded to AUC. Clinical impact was assigned to 1 of the following 3 categories: (1) active change in care, (2) continuation of current care, or (3) no change in care. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred thirty-five patients undergoing TTE. EXPOSURE: Transthoracic echocardiography. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of appropriate, inappropriate, and uncertain TTEs and prevalence of clinical impact subcategories. RESULTS: Overall, 31.8% of TTEs resulted in an active change in care; 46.9%, continuation of current care; and 21.3%, no change in care. By 2011 AUC, 91.8% of TTEs were appropriate; 4.3%, inappropriate; and 3.9%, uncertain. We detected no statistically significant difference between appropriate and inappropriate TTEs in the proportion of TTEs that led to active change in care (32.2% vs 21.7%; P= .29). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although 9 in 10 TTEs were appropriate by 2011 AUC, fewer than 1 in 3 TTEs resulted in an active change in care, nearly half resulted in continuation of current care, and slightly more than 1 in 5 resulted in no change in care. The low rate of active change in care (31.8%) among TTEs mostly classified as appropriate (91.8%) highlights the need for a better method to optimize TTE utilization to use limited health care resources efficiently while providing high-quality care.",*Academic Medical Centers Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/*ultrasonography Echocardiography/*utilization Female Follow-Up Studies Guideline Adherence/*utilization Humans Male Medical Records/statistics & numerical data Middle Aged Morbidity/trends Prevalence Retrospective Studies Texas/epidemiology Utilization Review/*methods

For 8 common procedures examined (appendectomy, cholecystectomy, colorectal cancer resection, cesarean delivery, hysterectomy, knee replacement, hip replacement, and hip fracture repair), mortality was equivalent between CAHs and non-CAHs (P > .05 for all), with the exception that Medicare beneficiaries undergoing hip fracture repair in CAHs had a higher risk of in-hospital death (adjusted odds ratio = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01-1.87). However, despite shorter hospital stays (P </= .001 for 4 procedures), costs at CAHs were 9.9% to 30.1% higher (P < .001 for all 8 procedures). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In-hospital mortality for common low-risk procedures is indistinguishable between CAHs and non-CAHs. Although our findings suggest the potential for cost savings, changes in payment policy for CAHs could diminish access to essential surgical care for rural populations.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cost Savings Female Health Services Accessibility Hospital Costs Hospital Mortality Hospitals, Rural/economics/*utilization Humans Length of Stay Male Middle Aged *Outcome Assessment (Health Care) Retrospective Studies Surgical Procedures, Operative/economics/*utilization United States"
24867012,Durability of class I American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association clinical practice guideline recommendations.,JAMA,Neuman MD and Goldstein JN and Cirullo MA and Schwartz JS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Little is known regarding the durability of clinical practice guideline recommendations over time. OBJECTIVE: To characterize variations in the durability of class I (""procedure/treatment should be performed/administered"") American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline recommendations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Textual analysis by 4 independent reviewers of 11 guidelines published between 1998 and 2007 and revised between 2006 and 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We abstracted all class I recommendations from the first of the 2 most recent versions of each guideline and identified corresponding recommendations in the subsequent version. We classified recommendations replaced by less determinate or contrary recommendations as having been downgraded or reversed; we classified recommendations for which no corresponding item could be identified as having been omitted. We tested for differences in the durability of recommendations according to guideline topic and underlying level of evidence using bivariable hypothesis tests and conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 619 index recommendations, 495 (80.0%; 95% CI, 76.6%-83.1%) were retained in the subsequent guideline version, 57 (9.2%; 95% CI, 7.0%-11.8%) were downgraded or reversed, and 67 (10.8%; 95% CI, 8.4%-13.3%) were omitted. The percentage of recommendations retained varied across guidelines from 15.4% (95% CI, 1.9%-45.4%) to 94.1% (95% CI, 80.3%-99.3%; P < .001). Among recommendations with available information on level of evidence, 90.5% (95% CI, 83.2%-95.3%) of recommendations supported by multiple randomized studies were retained, vs 81.0% (95% CI, 74.8%-86.3%) of recommendations supported by 1 randomized trial or observational data and 73.7% (95% CI, 65.8%-80.5%) of recommendations supported by opinion (P = .001). After accounting for guideline-level factors, the probability of being downgraded, reversed, or omitted was greater for recommendations based on opinion (odds ratio, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.69-5.85; P < .001) or on 1 trial or observational data (odds ratio, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.45-8.41; P = .005) vs recommendations based on multiple trials. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The durability of class I cardiology guideline recommendations for procedures and treatments promulgated by the ACC/AHA varied across individual guidelines and levels of evidence. Downgrades, reversals, and omissions were most common among recommendations not supported by multiple randomized studies.","American Heart Association Cardiology/*standards Evidence-Based Medicine/standards Humans Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Societies, Medical Time Factors United States"
24136624,Recent trends in epistaxis management in the United States: 2008-2010.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Villwock JA and Jones K,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The treatment of epistaxis is variable. It is important to analyze the effect of the available interventions on patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine demographic, management, and outcome trends in patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of epistaxis and treated with conservative management, nasal packing, arterial ligation, or embolization. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A review of the data reported by hospitals to the 2008-2010 Nationwide Inpatient Sample for patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of epistaxis was conducted. INTERVENTIONS: Conservative management, nasal packing, arterial ligation, or embolization for epistaxis control. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Descriptive statistics for hospital and patient demographic data. Multivariate models were constructed to compare treatment modalities, controlling for patient- and hospital-level variation while reporting the treatment outcomes of mortality, stroke, blindness, length of stay, and total cost. Comparisons were made between patients undergoing embolization, surgical ligation, or nasal packing. Descriptive statistics for patients treated conservatively are reported. RESULTS: A total of 57, 039 cases of primary epistaxis were identified. Of these, 21, 872 patients (38.3%) were treated conservatively, 30, 389 (53.3%) received nasal packing or cauterization, 2706 (4.7%) underwent arterial ligation, and 1956 (3.4%) underwent embolization The odds of stroke in patients following embolization were significantly higher than in patients who underwent nasal packing (odds ratio, 4.660; P = .003), with no significant difference seen compared with surgical ligation (P = .70). There were no significant differences in the odds of mortality or blindness between any of the study groups. Patients undergoing embolization incurred the highest total hospital costs, nearly doubling the cost of ligation (P < .001), without a corresponding increase in the length of hospital stay (P = .20). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment for epistaxis is highly variable. No significant differences in clinical outcomes were noted between arterial ligation and embolization in the population studied, although embolization resulted in significantly higher costs. Further prospective studies are needed to elucidate variables affecting outcomes of the various treatment options for epistaxis.","Adult Age Factors Aged Databases, Factual Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods/trends Epistaxis/*diagnosis/*therapy Female Follow-Up Studies Forecasting Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data Humans Ligation/methods/trends Male Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Recurrence Risk Assessment Severity of Illness Index Tampons, Surgical/trends Treatment Outcome United States"
23400560,The aging brain and cognition: contribution of vascular injury and abeta to mild cognitive dysfunction.,JAMA Neurol,Marchant NL and Reed BR and Sanossian N and Madison CM and Kriger S and Dhada R and Mack WJ and DeCarli C and Weiner MW and Mungas DM and Chui HC and Jagust WJ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: beta-Amyloid (Abeta) deposition and vascular brain injury (VBI) frequently co-occur and are both associated with cognitive decline in aging. Determining whether a direct relationship exists between them has been challenging. We sought to understand VBI's influence on cognition and clinical impairment, separate from and in conjunction with pathologic changes associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between neuroimaging measures of VBI and brain Abeta deposition and their associations with cognition. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional study in a community- and clinic-based sample recruited for elevated vascular disease risk factors. PARTICIPANTS: Clinically normal (mean age, 77.1 years [N = 30]), cognitively impaired (mean age, 78.0 years [N = 24]), and mildly demented (mean age, 79.8 years [N = 7]) participants. INTERVENTIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging, Abeta (Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomographic [PiB-PET]) imaging, and cognitive testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Magnetic resonance images were rated for the presence and location of infarct (34 infarct-positive participants, 27 infarct-negative participants) and were used to quantify white matter lesion volume. The PiB-PET uptake ratios were used to create a PiB index by averaging uptake across regions vulnerable to early Abeta deposition; PiB positivity (29 PiB-positive participants, 32 PiB-negative participants) was determined from a data-derived threshold. Standardized composite cognitive measures included executive function and verbal and nonverbal memory. RESULTS: Vascular brain injury and Abeta were independent in both cognitively normal and impaired participants. Infarction, particularly in cortical and subcortical gray matter, was associated with lower cognitive performance in all domains (P < .05 for all comparisons). Pittsburgh Compound B positivity was neither a significant predictor of cognition nor interacted with VBI. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this elderly sample with normal cognition to mild dementia, enriched for vascular disease, VBI was more influential than Abeta in contemporaneous cognitive function and remained predictive after including the possible influence of Abeta. There was no evidence that VBI increases the likelihood of Abeta deposition. This finding highlights the importance of VBI in mild cognitive impairment and suggests that the impact of cerebrovascular disease should be considered with respect to defining the etiology of mild cognitive impairment.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Aging/*pathology Amyloid beta-Peptides/*metabolism Aniline Compounds/diagnostic use Apolipoproteins E/genetics Brain Infarction/etiology Cross-Sectional Studies Executive Function Female Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Memory Mental Status Schedule Mild Cognitive Impairment/*etiology/genetics/*pathology/radionuclide imaging Neuropsychological Tests Positron-Emission Tomography Thiazoles/diagnostic use Vascular System Injuries/*complications"
25207994,Risk Factors and Characterization of Vitiligo and Alopecia Areata in Patients With Chronic Graft-vs-Host Disease.,JAMA Dermatol,Zuo RC and Naik HB and Steinberg SM and Baird K and Mitchell SA and Kuzmina Z and Pavletic SZ and Cowen EW,Missing,"Importance: Cutaneous manifestations of chronic graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) are highly variable and may recapitulate well-characterized autoimmune diseases, including systemic sclerosis and Sjogren syndrome. However, vitiligo and alopecia areata (AA) have not been well characterized in the chronic GvHD setting. Objective: To determine laboratory markers, transplant-related factors, and other systemic manifestations associated with vitiligo and/or AA in patients with chronic GvHD. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional, retrospective study conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of 282 adult and pediatric patients with chronic GvHD seen under the NIH natural history protocol between 2004 and 2013. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, including measures of 11 antibodies, were included in the analysis. Patients with vitiligo and/or AA were identified from dermatologist documentation and photographic evidence. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine risk factors for vitiligo and AA development. Results: Fifteen (5.3%) of 282 patients demonstrated vitiligo (14 of 282; 4.9%) and/or AA (2 of 282; 0.7%) (1 patient had both vitiligo and AA). Univariate analysis identified female donor to male recipient sex mismatch (P = .003), positive test results for anticardiolipin (ACA) IgG (P = .03) or antiparietal antibody (P = .049), elevated CD19 level (P = .045), and normal or elevated IgG level (P = .02) as risk factors for vitiligo or AA. Female donor to male recipient sex mismatch (P = .003) and positive findings for ACA-IgG (P = .01) retained significance in the multivariable analysis. Conclusions and Relevance: Female donor and female donor to male recipient sex mismatch, in particular, are significantly associated with the development of vitiligo and/or AA. Further studies are needed to explore transplant-related risk factors that may lead to better understanding of the pathomechanisms of chronic GvHD.",Missing
23381623,Why US adults use dietary supplements.,JAMA Intern Med,Bailey RL and Gahche JJ and Miller PE and Thomas PR and Dwyer JT,nih,"BACKGROUND: Dietary supplements are used by more than half of adults, although to our knowledge, the reasons motivating use have not been previously examined in US adults using nationally representative data. The purpose of this analysis was to examine motivations for dietary supplement use, characterize the types of products used for the most commonly reported motivations, and to examine the role of physicians and health care practitioners in guiding choices about dietary supplements. METHODS: Data from adults (>/=20 years; n = 11 956) were examined in the 2007-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative, cross-sectional, population-based survey. RESULTS: The most commonly reported reasons for using supplements were to ""improve"" (45%) or ""maintain"" (33%) overall health. Women used calcium products for ""bone health"" (36%), whereas men were more likely to report supplement use for ""heart health or to lower cholesterol"" (18%). Older adults (>/=60 years) were more likely than younger individuals to report motivations related to site-specific reasons like heart, bone and joint, and eye health. Only 23% of products were used based on recommendations of a health care provider. Multivitamin-mineral products were the most frequently reported type of supplement taken, followed by calcium and omega-3 or fish oil supplements. Supplement users are more likely to report very good or excellent health, have health insurance, use alcohol moderately, eschew cigarette smoking, and exercise more frequently than nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: Supplement users reported motivations related to overall health more commonly than for supplementing nutrients from food intakes. Use of supplements was related to more favorable health and lifestyle choices. Less than a quarter of supplements used by adults were recommended by a physician or health care provider.","Adult Age Factors *Attitude to Health Body Mass Index Data Interpretation, Statistical *Dietary Supplements/classification/utilization Female Health Behavior Health Status Humans Life Style Male *Micronutrients/administration & dosage/classification Middle Aged *Motivation Nutrition Surveys Nutritional Requirements *Physician's Role Preventive Medicine/methods/statistics & numerical data Sex Factors Socioeconomic Factors United States"
24100714,Falling threshold for treatment of borderline elevated thyrotropin levels-balancing benefits and risks: evidence from a large community-based study.,JAMA Intern Med,Taylor PN and Iqbal A and Minassian C and Sayers A and Draman MS and Greenwood R and Hamilton W and Okosieme O and Panicker V and Thomas SL and Dayan C,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Rates of thyroid hormone prescribing in the United States and the United Kingdom have increased substantially. If some of the increase is due to lowering the thyrotropin threshold for treatment, this may result in less benefit and greater harm. OBJECTIVE: To define trends in thyrotropin levels at the initiation of levothyroxine sodium therapy and the risk of developing a suppressed thyrotropin level following treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND EXPOSURE: Retrospective cohort study using data from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Among 52,298 individuals who received a prescription for levothyroxine between January 1, 2001, and October 30, 2009, we extracted data about the thyrotropin level before levothyroxine therapy initiation, clinical symptoms, and thyrotropin levels up to 5 years after levothyroxine was initiated. We excluded persons who had a history of hyperthyroidism, pituitary disease, or thyroid surgery; those who were taking thyroid-altering medication or if the levothyroxine prescription was related to pregnancy; and those who did not have a thyrotropin level measured within 3 months before the initiation of levothyroxine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The median thyrotropin level at the time of the index levothyroxine prescription, the odds of initiation of levothyroxine therapy at thyrotropin levels of 10.0 mIU/L or less, and the age-stratified odds of developing a low or suppressed thyrotropin level after levothyroxine therapy. RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2009, the median thyrotropin level at the initiation of levothyroxine therapy fell from 8.7 to 7.9 mIU/L. The odds ratio for prescribing levothyroxine at thyrotropin levels of 10.0 mIU/L or less in 2009 compared with 2001 (adjusted for changes in population demographics) was 1.30 (95% CI, 1.19-1.42; P < .001). Older individuals and individuals with cardiac risk factors had higher odds of initiation of levothyroxine therapy with a thyrotropin level 10.0 mIU/L or less. At 5 years after levothyroxine initiation, 5.8% of individuals had a thyrotropin level of <0.1 mIU/L. Individuals with depression or tiredness at baseline had increased odds of developing a suppressed thyrotropin level, whereas individuals with cardiac risk factors (eg, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and raised lipid levels) did not. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We observed a trend toward levothyroxine treatment of more marginal degrees of hypothyroidism and a substantial risk of developing a suppressed thyrotropin level following therapy.

23529201,Effects of the 2011 duty hour reforms on interns and their patients: a prospective longitudinal cohort study.,JAMA Intern Med,Sen S and Kranzler HR and Didwania AK and Schwartz AC and Amarnath S and Kolars JC and Dalack GW and Nichols B and Guille C,umich,"IMPORTANCE: In 2003, the first phase of duty hour requirements for US residency programs recommended by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) was implemented. Evidence suggests that this first phase of duty hour requirements resulted in a modest improvement in resident well-being and patient safety. To build on these initial changes, the ACGME recommended a new set of duty hour requirements that took effect in July 2011. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of the 2011 duty hour reforms on first-year residents (interns) and their patients. DESIGN: As part of the Intern Health Study, we conducted a longitudinal cohort study comparing interns serving before (2009 and 2010) and interns serving after (2011) the implementation of the new duty hour requirements. SETTING: Fifty-one residency programs at 14 university and community-based GME institutions. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2323 medical interns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported duty hours, hours of sleep, depressive symptoms, well-being, and medical errors at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of the internship year. RESULTS: Fifty-eight percent of invited interns chose to participate in the study. Reported duty hours decreased from an average of 67.0 hours per week before the new rules to 64.3 hours per week after the new rules were instituted (P < .001). Despite the decrease in duty hours, there were no significant changes in hours slept (6.8 --> 7.0; P = .17), depressive symptoms (5.8 --> 5.7; P = .55) or well-being score (48.5 --> 48.4; P = .86) reported by interns. With the new duty hour rules, the percentage of interns who reported concern about making a serious medical error increased from 19.9% to 23.3% (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although interns report working fewer hours under the new duty hour restrictions, this decrease has not been accompanied by an increase in hours of sleep or an improvement in depressive symptoms or well-being but has been accompanied by an unanticipated increase in self-reported medical errors.",Accreditation Adult Depression/psychology Female Humans Internship and Residency/*standards Job Satisfaction Longitudinal Studies Male Medical Errors Personnel Staffing and Scheduling Prospective Studies *Sleep *Work Schedule Tolerance Workload/psychology/*standards

Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET-CT) could help avoid noncurative surgery by identifying patients with occult metastases. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of preoperative PET-CT vs no PET-CT (control) on the surgical management of patients with resectable metastases and to investigate the effect of PET-CT on survival and the association between the standardized uptake value (ratio of tissue radioactivity to injected radioactivity adjusted by weight) and survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized trial of patients older than 18 years with colorectal cancer treated by surgery, with resectable metastases based on CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis within the previous 30 days, and with a clear colonoscopy within the previous 18 months was conducted between 2005 and 2013, involving 21 surgeons at 9 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, with PET-CT scanners at 5 academic institutions. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized using a 2 to 1 ratio to PET-CT or control. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a change in surgical management defined as canceled hepatic surgery, more extensive hepatic surgery, or additional organ surgery based on the PET-CT. Survival was a secondary outcome. RESULTS: Of the 263 patients who underwent PET-CT, 21 had a change in surgical management (8.0%; 95% CI, 5.0%-11.9%). Specifically, 7 patients (2.7%) did not undergo laparotomy, 4 (1.5%) had more extensive hepatic surgery, 9 (3.4%) had additional organ surgery (8 of whom had hepatic resection), and the abdominal cavity was opened in 1 patient but hepatic surgery was not performed and the cavity was closed. Liver resection was performed in 91% of patients in the PET-CT group and 92% of the control group. After a median follow-up of 36 months, the estimated mortality rate was 11.13 (95% CI, 8.95-13.68) events/1000 person-months for the PET-CT group and 12.71 (95% CI, 9.40-16.80) events/1000 person-months for the control group. Survival did not differ between the 2 groups (hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.60-1.21]; P = .38). The standardized uptake value was associated with survival (hazard ratio, 1.11 [90% CI, 1.07-1.15] per unit increase; P < .001). The C statistic for the model including the standardized uptake value was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.56-0.68) and without it was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.44-0.56). The difference in C statistics is 0.12 (95% CI, 0.04-0.21). The low C statistic suggests that the standard uptake value is not a strong predictor of overall survival. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with potentially resectable hepatic metastases of colorectal adenocarcinoma, the use of PET-CT compared with CT alone did not result in frequent change in surgical management. These findings raise questions about the value of PET-CT scans in this setting.

24068245,A nationwide study of the association between celiac disease and the risk of autistic spectrum disorders.,JAMA Psychiatry,Ludvigsson JF and Reichenberg A and Hultman CM and Murray JA,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Most case reports suggest an association between autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) and celiac disease (CD) or positive CD serologic test results, but larger studies are contradictory. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between ASDs and CD according to small intestinal histopathologic findings. DESIGN AND SETTING: Nationwide case-control study in Sweden. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Through 28 Swedish biopsy registers, we collected data about 26,995 individuals with CD (equal to villous atrophy, Marsh stage 3), 12,304 individuals with inflammation (Marsh stages 1-2), and 3719 individuals with normal mucosa (Marsh stage 0) but positive CD serologic test results (IgA/IgG gliadin, endomysium, or tissue transglutaminase) and compared them with 213,208 age- and sex-matched controls. Conditional logistic regression estimated odds ratios (ORs) for having a prior diagnosis of an ASD according to the Swedish National Patient Register. In another analysis, we used the Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for future ASDs in individuals undergoing small intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: A prior ASD was not associated with CD (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.51-1.68) or inflammation (OR 1.03; 95% CI, 0.40-2.64) but was associated with a markedly increased risk of having a normal mucosa but a positive CD serologic test result (OR, 4.57; 95% CI, 1.58-13.22). Restricting our data to individuals without a diagnosis of an ASD at the time of biopsy, CD (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.13-1.71) and inflammation (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.29-3.13) were both associated with moderate excess risks of later ASDs, whereas the HR for later ASDs in individuals with normal mucosa but positive CD serologic test results was 3.09 (95% CI, 1.99-4.80). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although this study found no association between CD or inflammation and earlier ASDs, there was a markedly increased risk of ASDs in individuals with normal mucosa but a positive CD serologic test result.","Atrophy/pathology Autistic Disorder/*complications/immunology/pathology Case-Control Studies Celiac Disease/*complications/immunology/pathology Female Humans Inflammation/complications/pathology Intestinal Mucosa/pathology Intestine, Small/pathology Male Registries Risk Factors Serologic Tests Sweden"

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: Twenty-eight US children's hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 1 526 051 unique patients hospitalized from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009, who were assigned to 1 of 5 chronic condition groups using 3M's Clinical Risk Group software. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trends in the number of patients, hospitalizations, hospital days, and charges analyzed with linear regression. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2009, hospitals experienced a greater increase in the number of children hospitalized with vs without a chronic condition (19.2% vs 13.7% cumulative increase, P < .001). The greatest cumulative increase (32.5%) was attributable to children with a significant chronic condition affecting 2 or more body systems, who accounted for 19.2% (n = 63 203) of patients, 27.2% (n = 111 685) of hospital discharges, 48.9% (n = 1.1 million) of hospital days, and 53.2% ($9.2 billion) of hospital charges in 2009. These children had a higher percentage of Medicaid use (56.5% vs 49.7%; P < .001) compared with children without a chronic condition. Cerebral palsy (9179 [14.6%]) and asthma (13 708 [21.8%]) were the most common primary diagnosis and comorbidity, respectively, observed among these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a chronic condition increasingly used more resources in a group of children's hospitals than patients without a chronic condition. The greatest growth was observed in hospitalized children with chronic conditions affecting 2 or more body systems.

Sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF) and uterosacral ligament suspension (ULS) are commonly performed transvaginal surgeries to correct apical prolapse. Little is known about their comparative efficacy and safety, and it is unknown whether perioperative behavioral therapy with pelvic floor muscle training (BPMT) improves outcomes of prolapse surgery. OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes between (1) SSLF and ULS and (2) perioperative BPMT and usual care in women undergoing surgery for vaginal prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, 2 x 2 factorial, randomized trial of 374 women undergoing surgery to treat both apical vaginal prolapse and stress urinary incontinence was conducted between 2008 and 2013 at 9 US medical centers. Two-year follow-up rate was 84.5%. INTERVENTIONS: The surgical intervention was transvaginal surgery including midurethral sling with randomization to SSLF (n = 186) or ULS (n = 188); the behavioral intervention was randomization to receive perioperative BPMT (n = 186) or usual care (n = 188). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome for the surgical intervention (surgical success) was defined as (1) no apical descent greater than one-third into vaginal canal or anterior or posterior vaginal wall beyond the hymen (anatomic success), (2) no bothersome vaginal bulge symptoms, and (3) no re-treatment for prolapse at 2 years. For the behavioral intervention, primary outcome at 6 months was urinary symptom scores (Urinary Distress Inventory; range 0-300, higher scores worse), and primary outcomes at 2 years were prolapse symptom scores (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory; range 0-300, higher scores worse) and anatomic success. RESULTS: At 2 years, surgical group was not significantly associated with surgical success rates (ULS, 59.2% [93/157] vs SSLF, 60.5% [92/152]; unadjusted difference, -1.3%; 95% CI, -12.2% to 9.6%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.5) or serious adverse event rates (ULS, 16.5% [31/188] vs SSLF, 16.7% [31/186]; unadjusted difference, -0.2%; 95% CI, -7.7% to 7.4%; adjusted OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.6). Perioperative BPMT was not associated with greater improvements in urinary scores at 6 months (adjusted treatment difference, -6.7; 95% CI, -19.7 to 6.2), prolapse scores at 24 months (adjusted treatment difference, -8.0; 95% CI, -22.1 to 6.1), or anatomic success at 24 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Two years after vaginal surgery for prolapse and stress urinary incontinence, neither ULS nor SSLF was significantly superior to the other for anatomic, functional, or adverse event outcomes. Perioperative BPMT did not improve urinary symptoms at 6 months or prolapse outcomes at 2 years.

Occurrences of unintentional sleep-related deaths among infants appear to be increasing. OBJECTIVES: To determine the trends and factors associated with infant bed sharing from 1993 through 2010, including the association of physician advice on bed sharing. DESIGN: National Infant Sleep Position study conducted with annual telephone surveys. SETTING: The 48 contiguous states. PARTICIPANTS: Nighttime caregivers of infants born within 7 months of each survey administration. Approximately 1000 interviews were completed annually. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Infant bed sharing as a usual practice. RESULTS: Of 18 986 participants, 11.2% reported an infant sharing a bed as a usual practice. Bed sharing increased from 1993 (6.5%) to 2010 (13.5%). Although bed sharing increased significantly among white respondents from 1993 to 2000 (P < .001), the increase from 2001 to 2010 was not significant (P = .48). Black and Hispanic respondents reported an increase in bed sharing throughout the study period, with no difference between the earlier and later periods (P = .63 and P = .77, respectively). After accounting for the study year, factors associated with increase in infant bed sharing as a usual practice included maternal educational level of less than high school compared with college or greater (adjusted odds ratio, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.12-1.79]); black (3.47 [2.97-4.05]), Hispanic (1.33 [1.10-1.61]), and other (2.46 [2.03-2.97]) maternal race or ethnicity compared with white race; household income of less than $20,000 (1.69 [1.44-1.99]) and $20,000 to $50,000 (1.29 [1.14-1.45]) compared with greater than $50,000; living in the West (1.61 [1.38-1.88]) or the South (1.47 [1.30-1.66]) compared with the Midwest; infants younger than 8 weeks (1.45 [1.21-1.73]) or ages 8 to 15 weeks (1.31 [1.17-1.45]) compared with 16 weeks or older; and being born prematurely compared with full-term (1.41 [1.22-1.62]). Almost 46% of the participants reported talking to a physician about bed sharing. Compared with those who did not receive advice from a physician, those who reported their physicians had a negative attitude were less likely to have the infant share a bed (adjusted odds ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53-0.82]), whereas a neutral attitude was associated with increased bed sharing (1.38 [1.05-1.80]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our finding of a continual increase in bed sharing throughout the study period among black and Hispanic infants suggests that the current American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation about bed sharing is not universally followed. The factors associated with infant bed sharing may be useful in evaluating the impact of a broad intervention to change behavior.",Attitude of Health Personnel *Beds Health Care Surveys Humans Infant Infant Care/*trends Logistic Models Odds Ratio Risk-Taking *Sleep Socioeconomic Factors
23529612,"Influence of surgeon experience, hospital volume, and specialty designation on outcomes in pediatric surgery: a systematic review.",JAMA Pediatr,McAteer JP and LaRiviere CA and Drugas GT and Abdullah F and Oldham KT and Goldin AB,washington,"IMPORTANCE: Analyses of volume-outcome relationships in adult surgery have found that hospital and physician characteristics affect patient outcomes, such as length of stay, hospital charges, complications, and mortality. Similar investigations in children's surgical specialties are fewer in number, and their conclusions are less clear. OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence regarding surgeon or hospital experience and their influence on outcomes in children's surgery. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A MEDLINE and EMBASE search was conducted for English-language studies published from January 1, 1980, through April 13, 2012. Titles and abstracts were screened in a standardized manner by 2 reviewers. Studies selected for inclusion had to use a measure of hospital or surgeon experience as a predictor variable and had to report postoperative outcomes as dependent response variables. Included studies were reviewed with regard to methodologic quality, and study results were extracted. FINDINGS: Sixty-three studies were reviewed. Significant heterogeneity was detected in exposure definitions, outcome measures, and risk adjustment, with the greatest heterogeneity seen in appendectomy studies. Various exposure levels were examined: hospital level in 48 (68%) studies, surgeon level in 11 (17%), and both in 9 (14%). Nineteen percent of studies did not adjust for confounding, and 57% did not adjust for sample clustering. The most consistent methods and reproducible results were seen in the pediatric cardiac surgical literature. Forty-nine studies (78%) showed positive correlation between experience and most primary outcomes, but differences in outcomes and exposure definitions made comparisons between studies difficult. In general, hospital-level factors tended to correlate with outcomes for high-complexity procedures, whereas surgeon-level factors tended to correlate with outcomes for more common procedures. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Data on experience-related outcomes in children's surgery are limited in number and vary widely in methodologic quality. Future studies should seek both to standardize definitions, making results more applicable, and to differentiate procedures affected by surgeon experience from those more affected by hospital resources and system-level variables.","Humans *Outcome Assessment (Health Care) *Pediatrics Specialties, Surgical Surgical Procedures, Operative/*statistics & numerical data"

The aim of this study was to examine temporal trends in HIV mortality by sex, race/ethnicity, and individual level of education (as a proxy for socioeconomic status). METHODS: We examined HIV deaths among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic men and women aged 25 to 64 years in 26 states (1993-2007; N=91 307) reported to the National Vital Statistics System. The main outcome measures were age-standardized HIV death rates, rate differences, and rate ratios by educational attainment and between the least- and the most-educated (</=12 vs >/=16 years) individuals. RESULTS: Between 1993-1995 and 2005-2007, mortality declined for most men and women by race/ethnicity and educational levels, with the greatest absolute decreases for nonwhites owing to their higher baseline rates. Among men with the most education, rates per 100 000 population decreased from 117.89 (95% CI, 101.08-134.70) to 15.35 (12.08-18.62) in blacks vs from 26.42 (24.93-27.92) to 1.79 (1.50-2.08) in whites. Rates were unchanged for the least-educated black women (26.76; 95% CI, 24.30-29.23; during 2005-2007) and remained high for similarly educated black men (52.71; 48.96-56.45). Relative declines were greater with increasing levels of education (P < .001), resulting in widening disparities. Among men, the disparity rate ratio (comparing the least and the most educated) increased from 1.04 (95% CI, 0.89-1.21) during 1993-1995 to 3.43 (2.74-4.30) during 2005-2007 for blacks and from 0.98 (0.91-1.05) to 2.82 (2.34-3.40) for whites. CONCLUSION: Although absolute declines in HIV mortality were greatest for nonwhites, rates remain high among blacks, especially in the lowest educated groups, underscoring the need for additional interventions.",Adult Age Distribution Cause of Death *Continental Population Groups Educational Status *Ethnic Groups Female *HIV HIV Infections/*ethnology/*mortality Humans Male Middle Aged Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Sex Distribution Socioeconomic Factors Survival Rate/trends United States
25027141,"Stroke incidence and mortality trends in US communities, 1987 to 2011.",JAMA,Koton S and Schneider AL and Rosamond WD and Shahar E and Sang Y and Gottesman RF and Coresh J,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Prior studies have shown decreases in stroke mortality over time, but data on validated stroke incidence and long-term trends by race are limited. OBJECTIVE: To study trends in stroke incidence and subsequent mortality among black and white adults in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort from 1987 to 2011. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study of 14,357 participants (282,097 person-years) free of stroke at baseline was facilitated in 4 different US communities. Participants were recruited for the purpose of studying all stroke hospitalizations and deaths and for collection of baseline information on cardiovascular risk factors (via interviews and physical examinations) in 1987-1989. Participants were followed up (via examinations, annual phone interviews, active surveillance of discharges from local hospitals, and linkage with the National Death Index) through December 31, 2011. The study physician reviewers adjudicated all possible strokes and classified them as definite or probable ischemic or hemorrhagic events. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Trends in rates of first-ever stroke per 10 years of calendar time were estimated using Poisson regression incidence rate ratios (IRRs), with subsequent mortality analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression models and hazard ratios (HRs) overall and by race, sex, and age divided at 65 years. RESULTS: Among 1051 (7%) participants with incident stroke, there were 929 with incident ischemic stroke and 140 with incident hemorrhagic stroke (18 participants had both during the study period). Crude incidence rates were 3.73 (95% CI, 3.51-3.96) per 1000 person-years for total stroke, 3.29 (95% CI, 3.08-3.50) per 1000 person-years for ischemic stroke, and 0.49 (95% CI, 0.41-0.57) per 1000 person-years for hemorrhagic stroke. Stroke incidence decreased over time in white and black participants (age-adjusted IRRs per 10-year period, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.66-0.87]; absolute decrease of 0.93 per 1000 person-years overall). The decrease in age-adjusted incidence was evident in participants age 65 years and older (age-adjusted IRR per 10-year period, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.59-0.81]; absolute decrease of 1.35 per 1000 person-years) but not evident in participants younger than 65 years (age-adjusted IRR per 10-year period, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.76-1.25]; absolute decrease of 0.09 per 1000 person-years) (P = .02 for interaction). The decrease in incidence was similar by sex. Of participants with incident stroke, 614 (58%) died through 2011. The mortality rate was higher for hemorrhagic stroke (68%) than for ischemic stroke (57%). Overall, mortality after stroke decreased over time (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.66-0.98]; absolute decrease of 8.09 per 100 strokes after 10 years [per 10-year period]). The decrease in mortality was mostly accounted for by the decrease at younger than age 65 years (HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.46-0.93]; absolute decrease of 14.19 per 100 strokes after 10 years [per 10-year period]), but was similar across race and sex. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a multicenter cohort of black and white adults in US communities, stroke incidence and mortality rates decreased from 1987 to 2011. The decreases varied across age groups, but were similar across sex and race, showing that improvements in stroke incidence and outcome continued to 2011.",African Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Aged Brain Ischemia/complications/ethnology/*mortality Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology Cerebral Hemorrhage/ethnology/*mortality Cohort Studies European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Female Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Mortality/trends Risk Factors Sex Factors Stroke/ethnology/*mortality United States/epidemiology

OBJECTIVE To determine the association between hospice ownership and (1) provision of community benefits, (2) setting and timing of the hospice population served, and (3) community outreach. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional survey (the National Hospice Survey), conducted from September 2008 through November 2009, of a national random sample of 591 Medicare-certified hospices operating throughout the United States. EXPOSURES For-profit or nonprofit hospice ownership. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Provision of community benefits; setting and timing of the hospice population served; and community outreach. RESULTS A total of 591 hospices completed our survey (84% response rate). For-profit hospices were less likely than nonprofit hospices to provide community benefits including serving as training sites (55% vs 82%; adjusted relative risk [ARR], 0.67 [95% CI, 0.59-0.76]), conducting research (18% vs 23%; ARR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.46-0.99]), and providing charity care (80% vs 82%; ARR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.80-0.96]). For-profit compared with nonprofit hospices cared for a larger proportion of patients with longer expected hospice stays including those in nursing homes (30% vs 25%; P = .009). For-profit hospices were more likely to exceed Medicare's aggregate annual cap (22% vs 4%; ARR, 3.66 [95% CI, 2.02-6.63]) and had a higher patient disenrollment rate (10% vs 6%; P &lt; .001). For-profit were more likely than nonprofit hospices to engage in outreach to low-income communities (61% vs 46%; ARR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.05-1.44]) and minority communities (59% vs 48%; ARR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.02-1.38]) and less likely to partner with oncology centers (25% vs 33%; ARR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.44-0.80]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Ownership-related differences are apparent among hospices in community benefits, population served, and community outreach. Although Medicare's aggregate annual cap may curb the incentive to focus on long-stay hospice patients, additional regulatory measures such as public reporting of hospice disenrollment rates should be considered as the share of for-profit hospices in the United States continues to increase.",Community-Institutional Relations Cross-Sectional Studies Hospices/economics/*organization & administration/statistics & numerical data Humans Medicare *Ownership Questionnaires United States
23400757,Availability of consumer prices from US hospitals for a common surgical procedure.,JAMA Intern Med,Rosenthal JA and Lu X and Cram P,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Many proposals for health care reform incentivize patients to play a more active role in selecting health care providers on the basis of quality and price. While data on quality are increasingly available, availability of pricing data is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether we could obtain pricing data for a common elective surgical procedure, total hip arthroplasty (THA). DESIGN: We randomly selected 2 hospitals from each state (plus Washington, DC) that perform THA, as well as the 20 top-ranked orthopedic hospitals according to US News and World Report rankings. We contacted each hospital by telephone between May 2011 and July 2012. Using a standardized script, we requested from each hospital the lowest complete ""bundled price"" (hospital plus physician fees) for an elective THA that was required by one of the author's 62-year-old grandmother. In our scenario, the grandmother did not have insurance but had the means to pay out of pocket. We explained that we were seeking the lowest complete price for the procedure. When we encountered hospitals that could provide the hospital fee only, we contacted a random hospital affiliated orthopedic surgery practice to obtain the physician fee. Each hospital was contacted up to 5 times in efforts to obtain pricing information. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: All top-ranked and a sample of non-top-ranked US hospitals performing THA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of hospitals able to provide a complete price estimate for THA (physician and hospital fee) for top-ranked and non-top-ranked hospitals and range of prices quoted by each group. RESULTS: Nine top-ranked hospitals (45%) and 10 non-top-ranked hospitals (10%) were able to provide a complete bundled price (P < .001). We were able to obtain a complete price estimate from an additional 3 top-ranked hospitals (15%) and 54 non-top-ranked hospitals (53%) (P = .002) by contacting the hospital and physician separately. The range of complete prices was wide for both top-ranked ($12,500-$105,000) and non-top-ranked hospitals ($11,100-$125,798). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We found it difficult to obtain price information for THA and observed wide variation in the prices that were quoted. Many health care providers cannot provide reasonable price estimates. Patients seeking elective THA may find considerable price savings through comparison shopping.","Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip/*economics *Costs and Cost Analysis/standards/statistics & numerical data Empirical Research *Fees, Medical Health Care Surveys Health Services Accessibility/*economics/standards *Hospital Charges Hospitals/standards Humans Orthopedics/economics/standards Random Allocation Relative Value Scales Surgical Procedures, Elective/economics United States"

Comprehensive data are limited regarding the prevalence of CVD risk factors in this population and relations of these traits to socioeconomic status (SES) and acculturation. OBJECTIVES: To describe prevalence of major CVD risk factors and CVD (coronary heart disease [CHD] and stroke) among US Hispanic/Latino individuals of different backgrounds, examine relationships of SES and acculturation with CVD risk profiles and CVD, and assess cross-sectional associations of CVD risk factors with CVD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, prospective, population-based Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos including individuals of Cuban (n = 2201), Dominican (n = 1400), Mexican (n = 6232), Puerto Rican (n = 2590), Central American (n = 1634), and South American backgrounds (n = 1022) aged 18 to 74 years. Analyses involved 15,079 participants with complete data enrolled between March 2008 and June 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adverse CVD risk factors defined using national guidelines for hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and smoking. Prevalence of CHD and stroke were ascertained from self-reported data. RESULTS: Age-standardized prevalence of CVD risk factors varied by Hispanic/Latino background; obesity and current smoking rates were highest among Puerto Rican participants (for men, 40.9% and 34.7%; for women, 51.4% and 31.7%, respectively); hypercholesterolemia prevalence was highest among Central American men (54.9%) and Puerto Rican women (41.0%). Large proportions of participants (80% of men, 71% of women) had at least 1 risk factor. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of 3 or more risk factors was highest in Puerto Rican participants (25.0%) and significantly higher (P < .001) among participants with less education (16.1%), those who were US-born (18.5%), those who had lived in the United States 10 years or longer (15.7%), and those who preferred English (17.9%). Overall, self-reported CHD and stroke prevalence were low (4.2% and 2.0% in men; 2.4% and 1.2% in women, respectively). In multivariate-adjusted models, hypertension and smoking were directly associated with CHD in both sexes as were hypercholesterolemia and obesity in women and diabetes in men (odds ratios [ORs], 1.5-2.2). For stroke, associations were positive with hypertension in both sexes, diabetes in men, and smoking in women (ORs, 1.7-2.6). CONCLUSION: Among US Hispanic/Latino adults of diverse backgrounds, a sizeable proportion of men and women had adverse major risk factors; prevalence of adverse CVD risk profiles was higher among participants with Puerto Rican background, lower SES, and higher levels of acculturation.",Acculturation Adolescent Adult Aged Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology/*ethnology Cross-Sectional Studies Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology/ethnology Female Hispanic Americans/*statistics & numerical data Humans Hyperlipidemias/epidemiology/ethnology Hypertension/epidemiology/ethnology Male Middle Aged Obesity/epidemiology/ethnology Prevalence Prospective Studies Puerto Rico/ethnology Risk Factors Smoking/epidemiology/ethnology Social Class Stroke/epidemiology/ethnology United States/epidemiology Young Adult

23821091,Autism and mental retardation among offspring born after in vitro fertilization.,JAMA,Sandin S and Nygren KG and Iliadou A and Hultman CM and Reichenberg A,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Between 1978 and 2010, approximately 5 million infants were born after in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. Yet limited information on neurodevelopment after IVF exists, especially after the first year of life. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between use of any IVF and different IVF procedures and the risk of autistic disorder and mental retardation in the offspring. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A population-based, prospective cohort study using Swedish national health registers. Offspring born between 1982 and 2007 were followed up for a clinical diagnosis of autistic disorder or mental retardation until December 31, 2009. The exposure of interest was IVF, categorized according to whether intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for male infertility was used and whether embryos were fresh or frozen. For ICSI, whether sperm were ejaculated or surgically extracted was also considered. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Relative risks (RRs) for autistic disorder and mental retardation and rates per 100,000 person-years, comparing spontaneously conceived offspring with those born after an IVF procedure and comparing 5 IVF procedures used in Sweden vs IVF without ICSI with fresh embryo transfer, the most common treatment. We also analyzed the subgroup restricted to singletons. RESULTS: Of the more than 2.5 million infants born, 30,959 (1.2%) were conceived by IVF and were followed up for a mean 10 (SD, 6) years. Overall, 103 of 6959 children (1.5%) with autistic disorder and 180 of 15,830 (1.1%) with mental retardation were conceived by IVF. The RR for autistic disorder after any procedure compared with spontaneous conception was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.94-1.39; 19.0 vs 15.6 per 100,000 person-years). The RR for mental retardation was 1.18 (95% CI, 1.01-1.36; 46.3 vs 39.8 per 100,000 person-years). For both outcomes, there was no statistically significant association when restricting analysis to singletons. Compared with IVF without ICSI with fresh embryo transfer, there were statistically significantly increased risks of autistic disorder following ICSI using surgically extracted sperm and fresh embryos (RR, 4.60 [95% CI, 2.14-9.88]; 135.7 vs 29.3 per 100,000 person-years); for mental retardation following ICSI using surgically extracted sperm and fresh embryos (RR, 2.35 [95% CI, 1.01-5.45]; 144.1 vs 60.8 per 100,000 person-years); and following ICSI using ejaculated sperm and fresh embryos (RR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.03-2.09]; 90.6 vs 60.8 per 100,000 person-years). When restricting the analysis to singletons, the risks of autistic disorder associated with ICSI using surgically extracted sperm were not statistically significant, but the risks associated with ICSI using frozen embryos were significant for mental retardation (with frozen embryos, RR, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.04-5.36], 118.4 vs 50.6 per 100,000 person-years]; with fresh embryos, RR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.00-2.57], 80.0 vs 50.6 per 100,000 person-years). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with spontaneous conception, IVF treatment overall was not associated with autistic disorder but was associated with a small but statistically significantly increased risk of mental retardation. For specific procedures, IVF with ICSI for paternal infertility was associated with a small increase in the RR for autistic disorder and mental retardation compared with IVF without ICSI. The prevalence of these disorders was low, and the increase in absolute risk associated with IVF was small.","Adult Autistic Disorder/*epidemiology Child Child, Preschool Embryo Transfer Female *Fertilization in Vitro Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Infertility, Male Intellectual Disability/*epidemiology Male Prevalence Prospective Studies Registries/statistics & numerical data Risk *Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic Sweden/epidemiology"
23699927,"Changes in sodium levels in processed and restaurant foods, 2005 to 2011.",JAMA Intern Med,Jacobson MF and Havas S and McCarter R,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Excess consumption of sodium is an important cause of hypertension, a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. The higher the level of consumption, the greater is a person's likelihood of developing hypertension. Numerous organizations have recommended reductions in sodium intake in the United States. Roughly 80% of the sodium consumed by Americans has been added by food manufacturers and restaurants. OBJECTIVE: To compare the mean (SD) levels of sodium for identical products ascertained in 2005, 2008, and 2011. DESIGN AND SETTING: Comparison study in an academic research setting. PARTICIPANTS AND EXPOSURES: Center for Science in the Public Interest staff have monitored sodium levels in selected processed foods and fast-food restaurant foods for many years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The sodium content in identical foods, as measured in 2005, 2008, and 2011. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2011, the sodium content in 402 processed foods declined by approximately 3.5%, while the sodium content in 78 fast-food restaurant products increased by 2.6%. Although some products showed decreases of at least 30%, a greater number of products showed increases of at least 30%. The predominant finding is the absence of any appreciable or statistically significant changes in sodium content during 6 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Based on our sample, reductions in sodium levels in processed and restaurant foods are inconsistent and slow. These findings are in accord with other data indicating the slow pace of voluntary reductions in sodium levels in processed and restaurant foods. Stronger action (eg, phased-in limits on sodium levels set by the federal government) is needed to lower sodium levels and reduce the prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases.","*Fast Foods Humans *Nutrition Policy Public Health Restaurants/*statistics & numerical data Sodium, Dietary/*analysis United States"

RESULTS: In 2001, 4958 of 3.3 million youth were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for a prevalence of 1.48 per 1000 (95% CI, 1.44-1.52). In 2009, 6666 of 3.4 million youth were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for a prevalence of 1.93 per 1000 (95% CI, 1.88-1.97). In 2009, the highest prevalence of type 1 diabetes was 2.55 per 1000 among white youth (95% CI, 2.48-2.62) and the lowest was 0.35 per 1000 in American Indian youth (95% CI, 0.26-0.47) and type 1 diabetes increased between 2001 and 2009 in all sex, age, and race/ethnic subgroups except for those with the lowest prevalence (age 0-4 years and American Indians). Adjusted for completeness of ascertainment, there was a 21.1% (95% CI, 15.6%-27.0%) increase in type 1 diabetes over 8 years. In 2001, 588 of 1.7 million youth were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for a prevalence of 0.34 per 1000 (95% CI, 0.31-0.37). In 2009, 819 of 1.8 million were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for a prevalence of 0.46 per 1000 (95% CI, 0.43-0.49). In 2009, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 1.20 per 1000 among American Indian youth (95% CI, 0.96-1.51); 1.06 per 1000 among black youth (95% CI, 0.93-1.22); 0.79 per 1000 among Hispanic youth (95% CI, 0.70-0.88); and 0.17 per 1000 among white youth (95% CI, 0.15-0.20). Significant increases occurred between 2001 and 2009 in both sexes, all age-groups, and in white, Hispanic, and black youth, with no significant changes for Asian Pacific Islanders and American Indians. Adjusted for completeness of ascertainment, there was a 30.5% (95% CI, 17.3%-45.1%) overall increase in type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Between 2001 and 2009 in 5 areas of the United States, the prevalence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents increased. Further studies are required to determine the causes of these increases.","Adolescent African Americans/statistics & numerical data Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*epidemiology/ethnology Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*epidemiology/ethnology European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data Hispanic Americans/statistics & numerical data Humans Indians, North American/statistics & numerical data Infant Infant, Newborn Prevalence United States/epidemiology Young Adult"
23736734,Bariatric surgery for weight loss and glycemic control in nonmorbidly obese adults with diabetes: a systematic review.,JAMA,Maggard-Gibbons M and Maglione M and Livhits M and Ewing B and Maher AR and Hu J and Li Z and Shekelle PG,ucla,"IMPORTANCE: Bariatric surgery is beneficial in persons with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or greater with obesity-related comorbidities. There is interest in using these procedures in persons with lower BMI and diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between bariatric surgery vs nonsurgical treatments and weight loss and glycemic control among patients with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance and BMI of 30 to 35. EVIDENCE REVIEW: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from January 1985 through September 2012. Of 1291 screened articles, we included 32 surgical studies, 11 systematic reviews on nonsurgical treatments, and 11 large nonsurgical studies published after those reviews. Weight loss, metabolic outcomes, and adverse events were abstracted by 2 independent reviewers. FINDINGS: Three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (N = 290; including 1 trial of 150 patients with type 2 diabetes and mean BMI of 37, 1 trial of 80 patients without diabetes [38% with metabolic syndrome] and BMI of 30 to 35, and 1 trial of 60 patients with diabetes and BMI of 30 to 40 [13 patients with BMI <35]) found that surgery was associated with greater weight loss (range, 14.4-24 kg) and glycemic control (range, 0.9-1.43 point improvements in hemoglobin A1c levels) during 1 to 2 years of follow-up than nonsurgical treatment. Indirect comparisons of evidence from observational studies of bariatric procedures (n approximately 600 patients) and meta-analyses of nonsurgical therapies (containing more than 300 RCTs) support this finding at 1 or 2 years of follow-up. However, there are no robust surgical data beyond 5 years of follow-up on outcomes of diabetes, glucose control, or macrovascular and microvascular outcomes. In contrast, some RCT data of nonsurgical therapies show benefits at 10 years of follow-up or more. Surgeon-reported adverse events were low (eg, hospital deaths of 0.3%-1.0%), but data were from select centers and surgeons. Long-term adverse events are unknown. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Current evidence suggests that, when compared with nonsurgical treatments, bariatric surgical procedures in patients with a BMI of 30 to 35 and diabetes are associated with greater short-term weight loss and better intermediate glucose outcomes. Evidence is insufficient to reach conclusions about the appropriate use of bariatric surgery in this population until more data are available about long-term outcomes and complications of surgery.",*Bariatric Surgery/adverse effects/methods Blood Glucose Body Mass Index Diabetes Complications Diabetes Mellitus/*surgery Glucose Intolerance Humans Meta-Analysis as Topic Obesity/complications/*surgery Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic *Weight Loss
24005847,Trends in sunscreen recommendation among US physicians.,JAMA Dermatol,Akamine KL and Gustafson CJ and Davis SA and Levender MM and Feldman SR,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Sunscreen is an important part of sun protection to prevent skin cancer but may not be recommended as often as guidelines dictate. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate trends in sunscreen recommendation among physicians to determine whether they are following suggested patient-education guidelines regarding sun protection, and to assess data regarding physician sunscreen recommendations to determine the association with patient demographics, physician specialty, and physician diagnosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey was queried to identify patient visits to nonfederal outpatient physician offices at US ambulatory care practices (January 1, 1989-December 26, 2010) during which sunscreen was recommended. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Frequency of sunscreen recommendation. RESULTS: According to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, there were an estimated 18.30 billion patient visits nationwide. Physicians mentioned sunscreen at approximately 12.83 million visits (0.07%). Mention of sunscreen was reported by physicians at 0.9% of patient visits associated with a diagnosis of skin disease. Dermatologists recorded the mention of sunscreen the most (86.4% of all visits associated with sunscreen). However, dermatologists reported mentioning sunscreen at only 1.6% of all dermatology visits. Sunscreen was mentioned most frequently to white patients, particularly those in their eighth decade of life, and least frequently to children. Actinic keratosis was the most common diagnosis associated with sunscreen recommendation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite encouragement to provide patient education regarding sunscreen use and sun-protective behaviors, the rate at which physicians are mentioning sunscreen at patient visits is quite low, even for patients with a history of skin cancer. The high incidence and morbidity of skin cancer can be greatly reduced with the implementation of sun-protective behaviors, which patients should be counseled about at outpatient visits.","Adolescent Adult Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Child Child, Preschool Continental Population Groups/statistics & numerical data Female Health Care Surveys Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Patient Education as Topic/methods Physician's Practice Patterns/*statistics & numerical data Physicians/*statistics & numerical data *Practice Guidelines as Topic Sex Factors Skin Neoplasms/*prevention & control Sunscreening Agents/*administration & dosage United States Young Adult"
24549551,Surgical site infections following ambulatory surgery procedures.,JAMA,Owens PL and Barrett ML and Raetzman S and Maggard-Gibbons M and Steiner CA,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Surgical site infections can result in substantial morbidity following inpatient surgery. Little is known about serious infections following ambulatory surgery. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of clinically significant surgical site infections (CS-SSIs) following low- to moderate-risk ambulatory surgery in patients with low risk for surgical complications. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis of ambulatory surgical procedures complicated by CS-SSIs that require a postsurgical acute care visit (defined as subsequent hospitalization or ambulatory surgical visit for infection) using the 2010 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Ambulatory Surgery and State Inpatient Databases for 8 geographically dispersed states (California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, and Tennessee) representing one-third of the US population. Index cases included 284 098 ambulatory surgical procedures (general surgery, orthopedic, neurosurgical, gynecologic, and urologic) in adult patients with low surgical risk (defined as not seen in past 30 days in acute care, length of stay less than 2 days, no other surgery on the same day, and discharged home and no infection coded on the same day). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of 14- and 30-day postsurgical acute care visits for CS-SSIs following ambulatory surgery. RESULTS: Postsurgical acute care visits for CS-SSIs occurred in 3.09 (95% CI, 2.89-3.30) per 1000 ambulatory surgical procedures at 14 days and 4.84 (95% CI, 4.59-5.10) per 1000 at 30 days. Two-thirds (63.7%) of all visits for CS-SSI occurred within 14 days of the surgery; of those visits, 93.2% (95% CI, 91.3%-94.7%) involved treatment in the inpatient setting. All-cause inpatient or outpatient postsurgical visits, including those for CS-SSIs, following ambulatory surgery occurred in 19.99 (95% CI, 19.48-20.51) per 1000 ambulatory surgical procedures at 14 days and 33.62 (95% CI, 32.96-34.29) per 1000 at 30 days. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients in 8 states undergoing ambulatory surgery, rates of postsurgical visits for CS-SSIs were low relative to all causes; however, they may represent a substantial number of adverse outcomes in aggregate. Thus, these serious infections merit quality improvement efforts to minimize their occurrence.","Adult Aged Ambulatory Care/*utilization *Ambulatory Surgical Procedures Databases, Factual Female Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Retrospective Studies Risk Surgical Wound Infection/*epidemiology Time Factors United States/epidemiology"

Whether the survival of patients who received an ICD in primary prevention clinical trials differs from that of trial-eligible patients receiving a primary prevention ICD in clinical practice is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether trial-eligible patients who received a primary prevention ICD as documented in a large national registry have a survival rate that differs from the survival rate of similar patients who received an ICD in the 2 largest primary prevention clinical trials, MADIT-II (n = 742) and SCD-HeFT (n = 829). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective analysis of data for patients enrolled in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD Registry between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2007, meeting the MADIT-II criteria (2464 propensity score-matched patients) or the SCD-HeFT criteria (3352 propensity score-matched patients). Mortality data for the registry patients were collected through December 31, 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare mortality from any cause. RESULTS: The median follow-up time in MADIT-II, SCD-HeFT, and the ICD Registry was 19.5, 46.1, and 35.2 months, respectively. Compared with patients enrolled in the clinical trials, patients in the ICD Registry were significantly older and had a higher burden of comorbidities. In the matched cohorts, there was no significant difference in survival between MADIT-II-like patients in the registry and MADIT-II patients randomized to receive an ICD (2-year mortality rates: 13.9% and 15.6%, respectively; adjusted ICD Registry vs trial hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.85-1.31; P = .62). Likewise, the survival among SCD-HeFT-like patients in the registry was not significantly different from survival among patients randomized to receive ICD therapy in SCD-HeFT (3-year mortality rates: 17.3% and 17.4%, respectively; adjusted registry vs trial hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.97-1.38; P = .11). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There was no significant difference in survival between clinical trial patients randomized to receive an ICD and a similar group of clinical registry patients who received a primary prevention ICD.

Early detection and lifestyle risk factors associated with HNC, both determinants of disease burden and outcomes, are interrelated with public knowledge of this disease. Understanding of current public knowledge of HNC is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To assess awareness and knowledge of HNC among US adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Online survey of 2126 randomly selected adults in the United States conducted in 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Online survey administration. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Subjective and objective assessment of knowledge of HNC including symptoms, risk factors, and association with the human papillomavirus. RESULTS: Self-reported respondent knowledge of HNC was low, with 66.0% reporting that they were ""not very"" or ""not at all"" knowledgeable. This did not vary significantly with tobacco use (P = .92), education (P = .053), sex (P = .07), or race (P = .02). Regarding sites comprising HNC, 22.1% of respondents correctly identified throat cancer, 15.3% mouth cancer, and 2.0% cancer of the larynx, with 21.0% incorrectly identifying brain cancer as HNC. Regarding symptoms, 14.9% of respondents identified ""red or white sores that do not heal,"" 5.2% ""sore throat,"" 1.3% ""swelling or lump in the throat,"" and 0.5% ""bleeding in the mouth or throat."" Smoking and chewing or spitting tobacco were identified by 54.5% and 32.7% of respondents as risk factors for mouth and throat cancer, respectively. Only 0.8% of respondents identified human papillomavirus (HPV) infection as a risk factor for mouth and throat cancer, but specific questioning revealed that 12.8% were aware of the association between HPV infection and throat cancer whereas 70.0% of respondents were aware of the vaccine targeting HPV. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Self-reported and objective measures indicate that few American adults know much about HNC including risk factors such as tobacco use and HPV infection and common symptoms. Strategies to improve public awareness and knowledge of signs, symptoms, and risk factors may decrease the disease burden of HNC and are important topics for future research.",Adult Cross-Sectional Studies Female *Head and Neck Neoplasms/etiology Humans *Knowledge Male Papillomavirus Infections/complications Risk Factors Smoking/adverse effects United States

It is unknown whether progress has been made in decreasing their mortality rate. OBJECTIVE: To describe changes in mortality for severe sepsis with and without shock in ICU patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, observational study from 2000 to 2012 including 101,064 patients with severe sepsis from 171 ICUs with various patient case mix in Australia and New Zealand. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospital outcome (mortality and discharge to home, to other hospital, or to rehabilitation). RESULTS: Absolute mortality in severe sepsis decreased from 35.0% (95% CI, 33.2%-36.8%; 949/2708) to 18.4% (95% CI, 17.8%-19.0%; 2300/12,512; P < .001), representing an overall decrease of 16.7% (95% CI, 14.8%-18.6%), an annual rate of absolute decrease of 1.3%, and a relative risk reduction of 47.5% (95% CI, 44.1%-50.8%). After adjusted analysis, mortality decreased throughout the study period with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.46-0.52) in 2012, using the year 2000 as the reference (P < .001). The annual decline in mortality did not differ significantly between patients with severe sepsis and those with all other diagnoses (OR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.94-0.95] vs 0.94 [95% CI, 0.94-0.94]; P = .37). The annual increase in rates of discharge to home was significantly greater in patients with severe sepsis compared with all other diagnoses (OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.02-1.03] vs 1.01 [95% CI, 1.01-1.01]; P < .001).

Identification of disease-associated variants helps identify targets for genetic testing, prevention, and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic loci associated with late-onset Alzheimer disease in African Americans. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) assembled multiple data sets representing a total of 5896 African Americans (1968 case participants, 3928 control participants) 60 years or older that were collected between 1989 and 2011 at multiple sites. The association of Alzheimer disease with genotyped and imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was assessed in case-control and in family-based data sets. Results from individual data sets were combined to perform an inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis, first with genome-wide analyses and subsequently with gene-based tests for previously reported loci. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Presence of Alzheimer disease according to standardized criteria. RESULTS: Genome-wide significance in fully adjusted models (sex, age, APOE genotype, population stratification) was observed for a SNP in ABCA7 (rs115550680, allele = G; frequency, 0.09 cases and 0.06 controls; odds ratio [OR], 1.79 [95% CI, 1.47-2.12]; P = 2.2 x 10(-9)), which is in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs previously associated with Alzheimer disease in Europeans (0.8 < D' < 0.9). The effect size for the SNP in ABCA7 was comparable with that of the APOE 4-determining SNP rs429358 (allele = C; frequency, 0.30 cases and 0.18 controls; OR, 2.31 [95% CI, 2.19-2.42]; P = 5.5 x 10(-47)). Several loci previously associated with Alzheimer disease but not reaching significance in genome-wide analyses were replicated in gene-based analyses accounting for linkage disequilibrium between markers and correcting for number of tests performed per gene (CR1, BIN1, EPHA1, CD33; 0.0005 < empirical P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this meta-analysis of data from African American participants, Alzheimer disease was significantly associated with variants in ABCA7 and with other genes that have been associated with Alzheimer disease in individuals of European ancestry. Replication and functional validation of this finding is needed before this information is used in clinical settings.","ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics African Americans/*genetics Age of Onset Aged Alzheimer Disease/*ethnology/*genetics Apolipoprotein E4/*genetics Case-Control Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation *Genome-Wide Association Study Genotype Humans Linkage Disequilibrium Middle Aged Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Risk"
23443443,"Incidence of breast cancer with distant involvement among women in the United States, 1976 to 2009.",JAMA,Johnson RH and Chien FL and Bleyer A,seattlechildrens,"IMPORTANCE: Evidence from the US National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database suggests that the incidence of advanced breast cancer in young women is increasing. OBJECTIVE: To quantify this trend and analyze it as a function of stage at diagnosis, race/ethnicity, residence, and hormone receptor status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Breast cancer incidence, incidence trends, and survival rates as a function of age and extent of disease at diagnosis were obtained from 3 SEER registries that provide data spanning 1973-2009, 1992-2009, and 2000-2009. SEER defines localized as disease confined to the breast, regional to contiguous and adjacent organ spread (eg, lymph nodes, chest wall), and distant disease to remote metastases (bone, brain, lung, etc). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Breast cancer incidence trends in the United States. RESULTS: In the United States, the incidence of breast cancer with distant involvement at diagnosis increased in 25- to 39-year-old women from 1.53 (95% CI, 1.01 to 2.21) per 100,000 in 1976 to 2.90 (95% CI, 2.31 to 3.59) per 100,000 in 2009. This is an absolute difference of 1.37 per 100,000, representing an average compounded increase of 2.07% per year (95% CI, 1.57% to 2.58%; P < .001) over the 34-year interval. No other age group or extent-of-disease subgroup of the same age range had a similar increase. For 25- to 39-year-olds, there was an increased incidence in distant disease among all races and ethnicities evaluated, especially non-Hispanic white and African American, and this occurred in both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. Incidence for women with estrogen receptor-positive subtypes increased more than for women with estrogen receptor-negative subtypes. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Based on SEER data, there was a small but statistically significant increase in the incidence of breast cancer with distant involvement in the United States between 1976 and 2009 for women aged 25 to 39 years, without a corresponding increase in older women.","Adult Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology/ethnology/*pathology Female Humans Incidence Middle Aged *Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasm Staging Residence Characteristics SEER Program Survival Analysis United States"
24519297,Risk of end-stage renal disease following live kidney donation.,JAMA,Muzaale AD and Massie AB and Wang MC and Montgomery RA and McBride MA and Wainright JL and Segev DL,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in kidney donors has been compared with risk faced by the general population, but the general population represents an unscreened, high-risk comparator. A comparison to similarly screened healthy nondonors would more properly estimate the sequelae of kidney donation. OBJECTIVES: To compare the risk of ESRD in kidney donors with that of a healthy cohort of nondonors who are at equally low risk of renal disease and free of contraindications to live donation and to stratify these comparisons by patient demographics. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 96,217 kidney donors in the United States between April 1994 and November 2011 and a cohort of 20,024 participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) were linked to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data to ascertain development of ESRD, which was defined as the initiation of maintenance dialysis, placement on the waiting list, or receipt of a living or deceased donor kidney transplant, whichever was identified first. Maximum follow-up was 15.0 years; median follow-up was 7.6 years (interquartile range [IQR], 3.9-11.5 years) for kidney donors and 15.0 years (IQR, 13.7-15.0 years) for matched healthy nondonors. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative incidence and lifetime risk of ESRD. RESULTS: Among live donors, with median follow-up of 7.6 years (maximum, 15.0), ESRD developed in 99 individuals in a mean (SD) of 8.6 (3.6) years after donation. Among matched healthy nondonors, with median follow-up of 15.0 years (maximum, 15.0), ESRD developed in 36 nondonors in 10.7 (3.2) years, drawn from 17 ESRD events in the unmatched healthy nondonor pool of 9364. Estimated risk of ESRD at 15 years after donation was 30.8 per 10,000 (95% CI, 24.3-38.5) in kidney donors and 3.9 per 10,000 (95% CI, 0.8-8.9) in their matched healthy nondonor counterparts (P < .001). This difference was observed in both black and white individuals, with an estimated risk of 74.7 per 10,000 black donors (95% CI, 47.8-105.8) vs 23.9 per 10,000 black nondonors (95% CI, 1.6-62.4; P < .001) and an estimated risk of 22.7 per 10,000 white donors (95% CI, 15.6-30.1) vs 0.0 white nondonors (P < .001). Estimated lifetime risk of ESRD was 90 per 10,000 donors, 326 per 10,000 unscreened nondonors (general population), and 14 per 10,000 healthy nondonors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with matched healthy nondonors, kidney donors had an increased risk of ESRD over a median of 7.6 years; however, the magnitude of the absolute risk increase was small. These findings may help inform discussions with persons considering live kidney donation.","Adolescent Adult Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies Data Collection Female Humans Incidence Kidney Failure, Chronic/*epidemiology *Kidney Transplantation *Living Donors Male Medicaid Medicare Middle Aged Nephrectomy/adverse effects Nutrition Surveys Risk Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*adverse effects United States/epidemiology Young Adult"

Secondary outcomes were noninferiority of GMT ratios of girls receiving 2 vs 3 doses of vaccine; and durability of noninferiority to 36 months. RESULTS: The GMT ratios were noninferior for girls (2 doses) to women (3 doses): 2.07 (95% CI, 1.62-2.65) for HPV-16 and 1.76 (95% CI, 1.41-2.19) for HPV-18. Girls (3 doses) had GMT responses 1 month after last vaccination for HPV-16 of 7736 milli-Merck units per mL (mMU/mL) (95% CI, 6651-8999) and HPV-18 of 1730 mMU/mL (95% CI, 1512-1980). The GMT ratios were noninferior for girls (2 doses) to girls (3 doses): 0.95 (95% CI, 0.73-1.23) for HPV-16 and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.54-0.85) for HPV-18. The GMT ratios for girls (2 doses) to women (3 doses) remained noninferior for all genotypes to 36 months. Antibody responses in girls were noninferior after 2 doses vs 3 doses for all 4 vaccine genotypes at month 7, but not for HPV-18 by month 24 or HPV-6 by month 36. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among girls who received 2 doses of HPV vaccine 6 months apart, responses to HPV-16 and HPV-18 one month after the last dose were noninferior to those among young women who received 3 doses of the vaccine within 6 months. Because of the loss of noninferiority to some genotypes at 24 to 36 months in girls given 2 doses vs 3 doses, more data on the duration of protection are needed before reduced-dose schedules can be recommended.

A large population of survivors has not been evaluated using a comprehensive systematic clinical assessment to determine the prevalence of chronic health conditions. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of adverse health outcomes and the proportion associated with treatment-related exposures in a large cohort of adult survivors of childhood cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Presence of health outcomes was ascertained using systematic exposure-based medical assessments among 1713 adult (median age, 32 [range, 18-60] years) survivors of childhood cancer (median time from diagnosis, 25 [range, 10-47] years) enrolled in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study since October 1, 2007, and undergoing follow-up through October 31, 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age-specific cumulative prevalence of adverse outcomes by organ system. RESULTS: Using clinical criteria, the crude prevalence of adverse health outcomes was highest for pulmonary (abnormal pulmonary function, 65.2% [95% CI, 60.4%-69.8%]), auditory (hearing loss, 62.1% [95% CI, 55.8%-68.2%]), endocrine or reproductive (any endocrine condition, such as hypothalamic-pituitary axis disorders and male germ cell dysfunction, 62.0% [95% CI, 59.5%-64.6%]), cardiac (any cardiac condition, such as heart valve disorders, 56.4% [95% CI, 53.5%-59.2%]), and neurocognitive (neurocognitive impairment, 48.0% [95% CI, 44.9%-51.0%]) function, whereas abnormalities involving hepatic (liver dysfunction, 13.0% [95% CI, 10.8%-15.3%]), skeletal (osteoporosis, 9.6% [95% CI, 8.0%-11.5%]), renal (kidney dysfunction, 5.0% [95% CI, 4.0%-6.3%]), and hematopoietic (abnormal blood cell counts, 3.0% [95% CI, 2.1%-3.9%]) function were less common. Among survivors at risk for adverse outcomes following specific cancer treatment modalities, the estimated cumulative prevalence at age 50 years was 21.6% (95% CI, 19.3%-23.9%) for cardiomyopathy, 83.5% (95% CI, 80.2%-86.8%) for heart valve disorder, 81.3% (95% CI, 77.6%-85.0%) for pulmonary dysfunction, 76.8% (95% CI, 73.6%-80.0%) for pituitary dysfunction, 86.5% (95% CI, 82.3%-90.7%) for hearing loss, 31.9% (95% CI, 28.0%-35.8%) for primary ovarian failure, 31.1% (95% CI, 27.3%-34.9%) for Leydig cell failure, and 40.9% (95% CI, 32.0%-49.8%) for breast cancer. At age 45 years, the estimated cumulative prevalence of any chronic health condition was 95.5% (95% CI, 94.8%-98.6%) and 80.5% (95% CI, 73.0%-86.6%) for a serious/disabling or life-threatening chronic condition. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adult survivors of childhood cancer, the prevalence of adverse health outcomes was high, and a systematic risk-based medical assessment identified a substantial number of previously undiagnosed problems that are more prevalent in an older population. These findings underscore the importance of ongoing health monitoring for adults who survive childhood cancer.","Adolescent Adult Chronic Disease/*epidemiology Cohort Studies Endocrine System/physiopathology Female Health Status Heart/physiopathology Humans Lung/physiopathology Male Middle Aged Neoplasms/*epidemiology/therapy Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology Nervous System/physiopathology Prevalence Risk Assessment Severity of Illness Index *Survivors Young Adult"

OBJECTIVE: To measure associations between QRS duration and morphology and outcomes among patients receiving a CRT defibrillator (CRT-D) in clinical practice. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry's ICD Registry between 2006 and 2009 who underwent CRT-D implantation. Patients were stratified according to whether they were admitted for CRT-D implantation or for another reason, then categorized as having either LBBB or no LBBB and QRS duration of either 150 ms or greater or 120 to 149 ms. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause mortality; all-cause, cardiovascular, and heart failure readmission; and complications. Patients underwent follow-up for up to 3 years, with follow-up through December 2011. RESULTS: Among 24 169 patients admitted for CRT-D implantation, 1-year and 3-year mortality rates were 9.2% and 25.9%, respectively. All-cause readmission rates were 10.2% at 30 days and 43.3% at 1 year. Both the unadjusted rate and adjusted risk of 3-year mortality were lowest among patients with LBBB and QRS duration of 150 ms or greater (20.9%), compared with LBBB and QRS duration of 120 to 149 ms (26.5%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.30 [99% CI, 1.18-1.42]), no LBBB and QRS duration of 150 ms or greater (30.7%; HR, 1.34 [99% CI, 1.20-1.49]), and no LBBB and QRS duration of 120 to 149 ms (32.3%; HR, 1.52 [99% CI, 1.38-1.67]). The unadjusted rate and adjusted risk of 1-year all-cause readmission were also lowest among patients with LBBB and QRS duration of 150 ms or greater (38.6%), compared with LBBB and QRS duration of 120 to 149 ms (44.8%; adjusted HR, 1.18 [99% CI, 1.10-1.26]), no LBBB and QRS duration of 150 ms or greater (45.7%; HR, 1.16 [99% CI, 1.08-1.26]), and no LBBB and QRS duration of 120 to 149 ms (49.6%; HR, 1.31 [99% CI, 1.23-1.40]).

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, representative, population-based study, primary analysis of the SUN-Study 2012 (Sunbed-Use: Needs for Action-Study). SETTING: Nationwide telephone survey of the general population in Germany. PARTICIPANTS Study participants (n=4851) aged 14 to 45 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of sunbed use and, if applicable, motivational reasons for use, the location of the most recent use, and the available advisory service. Characteristics of typical sunbed users were identified using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of sunbed use was 39.2% (ever users); 14.6% had used a sunbed within the last 12 months (current users). Among minors and persons with skin types I or II, this proportion was 5.2% and 8.9%, respectively. Positive determinants of current sunbed use (quantified as odds ratios [95% CIs]) were female sex (1.97 [1.64-2.37]), immigrant background (1.46 [1.21-1.77]), and full-time (1.93 [1.53-2.43]) or part-time employment (1.44 [1.11-1.85]). The main motivations for tanning were relaxation and increased attractiveness. Sunbeds were mainly used in tanning studios (74.9%), and many users had never been advised about potential health risks (72.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study emphasize the need for more frequent and higher-quality educational interventions to change tanning behavior, particularly among women, people with darker skin, and those with an immigrant background.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate risk of H. pylori recurrence and assess factors associated with successful eradication 1 year after treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort analysis of 1463 randomized trial participants aged 21 to 65 years from 7 Latin American communities, who were treated for H. pylori and observed between September 2009 and July 2011. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 14-day lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (triple therapy); 5-day lansoprazole and amoxicillin followed by 5-day lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole (sequential); or 5-day lansoprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole (concomitant). Participants with a positive (13)C-urea breath test (UBT) 6 to 8 weeks posttreatment were offered voluntary re-treatment with 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Recurrent infection after a negative posttreatment UBT and factors associated with successful eradication at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Among participants with UBT-negative results who had a 1-year follow-up UBT (n=1091), 125 tested UBT positive, a recurrence risk of 11.5% (95% CI, 9.6%-13.5%). Recurrence was significantly associated with study site (P = .03), nonadherence to initial therapy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.94; 95% CI, 1.31-6.13; P = .01), and children in the household (AOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.35 per child; P = .03). Of the 281 with positive posttreatment UBT results, 138 completed re-treatment, of whom 93 tested UBT negative at 1 year. Among the 1340 who had a 1-year UBT, 80.4% (95% CI, 76.4%-83.9%), 79.8% (95% CI, 75.8%-83.5%), and 77.8% (95% CI, 73.6%-81.6%) had UBT-negative results in the triple, sequential, and concomitant groups, respectively (P = .61), with 79.3% overall effectiveness (95% CI, 77.1%-81.5%). In a single-treatment course analysis that ignored the effects of re-treatment, the percentage of UBT-negative results at 1 year was 72.4% (95% CI, 69.9%-74.8%) and was significantly associated with study site (P < .001), adherence to initial therapy (AOR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.15-0.42; P < .001), male sex (AOR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.25-2.13; P < .001), and age (AOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02-1.27 per decade; P = .02). One-year effectiveness among all 1463 enrolled participants, considering all missing UBT results as positive, was 72.7% (95% CI, 70.3%-74.9%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: One year after treatment for H. pylori infection, recurrence occurred in 11.5% of participants who had negative posttreatment UBT results. Recurrence determinants (ie, nonadherence and demographics) may be as important as specific antibiotic regimen in determining the long-term success of H. pylori eradication interventions.

The pharmacogenomic basis of phenytoin-related severe cutaneous adverse reactions remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genetic factors associated with phenytoin-related severe cutaneous adverse reactions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case-control study conducted in 2002-2014 among 105 cases with phenytoin-related severe cutaneous adverse reactions (n=61 Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and n=44 drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), 78 cases with maculopapular exanthema, 130 phenytoin-tolerant control participants, and 3655 population controls from Taiwan, Japan, and Malaysia. A genome-wide association study (GWAS), direct sequencing of the associated loci, and replication analysis were conducted using the samples from Taiwan. The initial GWAS included samples of 60 cases with phenytoin-related severe cutaneous adverse reactions and 412 population controls from Taiwan. The results were validated in (1) 30 cases with severe cutaneous adverse reactions and 130 phenytoin-tolerant controls from Taiwan, (2) 9 patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and 2869 population controls from Japan, and (3) 6 cases and 374 population controls from Malaysia. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Specific genetic factors associated with phenytoin-related severe cutaneous adverse reactions. RESULTS: The GWAS discovered a cluster of 16 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP2C genes at 10q23.33 that reached genome-wide significance. Direct sequencing of CYP2C identified missense variant rs1057910 (CYP2C9*3) that showed significant association with phenytoin-related severe cutaneous adverse reactions (odds ratio, 12; 95% CI, 6.6-20; P=1.1 x 10(-17)). The statistically significant association between CYP2C9*3 and phenytoin-related severe cutaneous adverse reactions was observed in additional samples from Taiwan, Japan, and Malaysia. A meta-analysis using the data from the 3 populations showed an overall odds ratio of 11 (95% CI, 6.2-18; z=8.58; P < .00001) for CYP2C9*3 association with phenytoin-related severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Delayed clearance of plasma phenytoin was detected in patients with severe cutaneous adverse reactions, especially CYP2C9*3 carriers, providing a functional link of the associated variants to the disease. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study identified CYP2C variants, including CYP2C9*3, known to reduce drug clearance, as important genetic factors associated with phenytoin-related severe cutaneous adverse reactions.","Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Anticonvulsants/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/*genetics Case-Control Studies Eosinophilia/*chemically induced/genetics Female Genome-Wide Association Study Humans Japan Malaysia Male Middle Aged Pharmacogenetics Phenytoin/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/*genetics Taiwan Young Adult"

Identification of gene carriers currently relies on germline analysis in patients with MMR-deficient tumors, but criteria to select individuals in whom tumor MMR testing should be performed are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To establish a highly sensitive and efficient strategy for the identification of MMR gene mutation carriers among CRC probands. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Pooled-data analysis of 4 large cohorts of newly diagnosed CRC probands recruited between 1994 and 2010 (n = 10,206) from the Colon Cancer Family Registry, the EPICOLON project, the Ohio State University, and the University of Helsinki examining personal, tumor-related, and family characteristics, as well as microsatellite instability, tumor MMR immunostaining, and germline MMR mutational status data. MAIN OUTCOME: Performance characteristics of selected strategies (Bethesda guidelines, Jerusalem recommendations, and those derived from a bivariate/multivariate analysis of variables associated with Lynch syndrome) were compared with tumor MMR testing of all CRC patients (universal screening). RESULTS: Of 10,206 informative, unrelated CRC probands, 312 (3.1%) were MMR gene mutation carriers. In the population-based cohorts (n = 3671 probands), the universal screening approach (sensitivity, 100%; 95% CI, 99.3%-100%; specificity, 93.0%; 95% CI, 92.0%-93.7%; diagnostic yield, 2.2%; 95% CI, 1.7%-2.7%) was superior to the use of Bethesda guidelines (sensitivity, 87.8%; 95% CI, 78.9%-93.2%; specificity, 97.5%; 95% CI, 96.9%-98.0%; diagnostic yield, 2.0%; 95% CI, 1.5%-2.4%; P < .001), Jerusalem recommendations (sensitivity, 85.4%; 95% CI, 77.1%-93.6%; specificity, 96.7%; 95% CI, 96.0%-97.2%; diagnostic yield, 1.9%; 95% CI, 1.4%-2.3%; P < .001), and a selective strategy based on tumor MMR testing of cases with CRC diagnosed at age 70 years or younger and in older patients fulfilling the Bethesda guidelines (sensitivity, 95.1%; 95% CI, 89.8%-99.0%; specificity, 95.5%; 95% CI, 94.7%-96.1%; diagnostic yield, 2.1%; 95% CI, 1.6%-2.6%; P < .001). This selective strategy missed 4.9% of Lynch syndrome cases but resulted in 34.8% fewer cases requiring tumor MMR testing and 28.6% fewer cases undergoing germline mutational analysis than the universal approach. CONCLUSION: Universal tumor MMR testing among CRC probands had a greater sensitivity for the identification of Lynch syndrome compared with multiple alternative strategies, although the increase in the diagnostic yield was modest.","Adult Aged Cohort Studies Colorectal Neoplasms, Hereditary Nonpolyposis/*diagnosis/*genetics DNA Mismatch Repair/*genetics DNA Repair Enzymes/*genetics Family Female Finland Genetic Testing/*standards Humans Male Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Ohio Registries/statistics & numerical data Sensitivity and Specificity"
23440149,Types and origins of diagnostic errors in primary care settings.,JAMA Intern Med,Singh H and Giardina TD and Meyer AN and Forjuoh SN and Reis MD and Thomas EJ,bcm,"IMPORTANCE: Diagnostic errors are an understudied aspect of ambulatory patient safety. OBJECTIVES: To determine the types of diseases missed and the diagnostic processes involved in cases of confirmed diagnostic errors in primary care settings and to determine whether record reviews could shed light on potential contributory factors to inform future interventions. DESIGN: We reviewed medical records of diagnostic errors detected at 2 sites through electronic health record-based triggers. Triggers were based on patterns of patients' unexpected return visits after an initial primary care index visit. SETTING: A large urban Veterans Affairs facility and a large integrated private health care system. PARTICIPANTS: Our study focused on 190 unique instances of diagnostic errors detected in primary care visits between October 1, 2006, and September 30, 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Through medical record reviews, we collected data on presenting symptoms at the index visit, types of diagnoses missed, process breakdowns, potential contributory factors, and potential for harm from errors. RESULTS: In 190 cases, a total of 68 unique diagnoses were missed. Most missed diagnoses were common conditions in primary care, with pneumonia (6.7%), decompensated congestive heart failure (5.7%), acute renal failure (5.3%), cancer (primary) (5.3%), and urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis (4.8%) being most common. Process breakdowns most frequently involved the patient-practitioner clinical encounter (78.9%) but were also related to referrals (19.5%), patient-related factors (16.3%), follow-up and tracking of diagnostic information (14.7%), and performance and interpretation of diagnostic tests (13.7%). A total of 43.7% of cases involved more than one of these processes. Patient-practitioner encounter breakdowns were primarily related to problems with history-taking (56.3%), examination (47.4%), and/or ordering diagnostic tests for further workup (57.4%). Most errors were associated with potential for moderate to severe harm. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Diagnostic errors identified in our study involved a large variety of common diseases and had significant potential for harm. Most errors were related to process breakdowns in the patient-practitioner clinical encounter. Preventive interventions should target common contributory factors across diagnoses, especially those that involve data gathering and synthesis in the patient-practitioner encounter.",Aged *Ambulatory Care/methods/standards Ambulatory Care Information Systems/statistics & numerical data *Diagnosis *Diagnostic Errors/classification/prevention & control/statistics & numerical data Disease/*classification Electronic Health Records Female Health Care Surveys Humans Male Middle Aged Outcome Assessment (Health Care)/*statistics & numerical data *Primary Health Care/methods/standards Quality of Health Care United States/epidemiology United States Department of Veterans Affairs
23552850,Influence of race on the management of lower extremity ischemia: revascularization vs amputation.,JAMA Surg,Durazzo TS and Frencher S and Gusberg R,yale,"IMPORTANCE: Among patients presenting with critical lower extremity ischemia, it has been previously documented that white individuals are more likely to undergo revascularization than nonwhite individuals, with the disparity largely attributed to differences in resources and access to care. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the amputation disparity between white and nonwhite patients with critical lower extremity ischemia in more detail using a larger data set than previous studies, with a focus on the role of confounding factors such as access and hospital resources. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: All hospital discharge records from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of adult patients with the primary diagnosis of critical lower extremity ischemia from 2002-2008 were examined in detail using multiple logistic regression (n = 774,399). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of amputation and revascularization for peripheral vascular disease across race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Controlling for confounding factors, black patients were found to have 1.77 times the odds of receiving an amputation compared with white patients (95% CI, 1.72-1.84; P < .001). Further analysis revealed the black to white odds ratio paradoxically increased with increasing revascularization capacity of the presenting hospital, from a low of 1.43 (95% CI, 1.23-1.65) to a high of 1.98 (95% CI, 1.83-2.24). The amputation disparity also paradoxically increased for patients living in wealthier zip codes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Black patients have greater odds of undergoing amputation than white patients, even after correcting for an array of confounding parameters. Contrary to current beliefs that the disparity is mainly secondary to differences in access, this study found that the disparity was magnified in settings where resources were greatest. Whether the explanation lies primarily in patient-specific, physician-specific, or institutional-specific factors remains to be determined but is critical to better understanding our health care system and maintaining approaches that are consistently fair and equitable.",*African Americans Aged Amputation/*statistics & numerical data Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) Female Healthcare Disparities/ethnology Humans Ischemia/*ethnology/*surgery Logistic Models Lower Extremity/*blood supply Male Retrospective Studies Vascular Surgical Procedures/*statistics & numerical data
23478883,"Older adults and forgoing cancer screening: ""I think it would be strange"".",JAMA Intern Med,Torke AM and Schwartz PH and Holtz LR and Montz K and Sachs GA,iupui,"IMPORTANCE: Although there is a growing recognition that older adults and those with extensive comorbid conditions undergo cancer screening too frequently, there is little information about patients' perceptions regarding cessation of cancer screening. Information on older adults' views of screening cessation would be helpful both for clinicians and for those designing interventions to reduce overscreening. OBJECTIVE: To obtain a deeper understanding of older adults' perspectives on screening cessation and their experiences communicating with clinicians about this topic. DESIGN: Semistructured interview study. SETTING: Senior health center affiliated with an urban hospital. PARTICIPANTS: We interviewed 33 older adults presenting to a senior health center. Their median age was 76 years (range, 63-91 years). Of the 33 participants, 27 were women; 15 were African American, 16 were white, 1 was Asian, and 1 was American Indian. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We transcribed audio recordings of interviews and analyzed them using methods of grounded theory to identify themes and illustrative quotes. RESULTS: Undergoing screening tests was perceived by participants as morally obligatory. Although many saw continued screening as a habit or custom not involving any decision, cessation of screening would require a major decision. Many asserted that they had never discussed screening cessation with their physicians or considered stopping on their own; some reported being upset when their physician recommended stopping. Although some would accept a physician's strong recommendation to stop, others thought that such a physician's recommendation would threaten trust or lead them to get another opinion. Participants were skeptical about the role of statistics and the recommendations of government panels in screening decisions but were more favorable toward stopping because of the balance of risks and benefits, complications, or test burdens. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For many older adults, stopping screening is a major decision, but continuing screening is not. A physician's recommendation to stop may threaten patient trust. Effective strategies to reduce nonbeneficial screening may include discussion of the balance of risks and benefits, complications, or burdens.","Aged/*psychology Aged, 80 and over Attitude Attitude of Health Personnel Communication Decision Making Early Detection of Cancer/*psychology Female Humans Interviews as Topic Male Middle Aged Physician-Patient Relations"

DESIGN AND SETTING: Province-wide retrospective analysis of residents of Ontario, Canada, long-term care facilities in 2010. PARTICIPANTS: All adults aged 66 years or older who received an incident treatment course with a systemic antibiotic while residing in an Ontario long-term care facility. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Antibiotic treatment duration was examined across residents and prescribing physicians. The proportion of a physician's treatment courses that exceeded 7 days was used to classify short-, average-, and long-duration prescribers. RESULTS: Of 66 901 long-term care residents from 630 long-term care facilities, 50 061 (77.8%) received an incident antibiotic treatment course (with 51 540 antibiotic courses prescribed). The most commonly selected antibiotic treatment course was 7 days (in 21 136 courses [41.0%]), but 23 124 (44.9%) exceeded 7 days. Among the 699 physicians responsible for 20 or more antibiotic treatment courses, the median (interquartile range) proportion of treatment courses beyond 7 days was 43.5% (26.9%-62.9%) (range, 0%-97.1%). Twenty-one percent of prescribers had a higher-than-expected proportion of prescriptions beyond the 7-day threshold. Patient characteristics were similar across short-, average-, and long-duration prescribers. A mixed logistic model confirmed that prescribers were an important determinant of treatment duration (P < .001), with a relative odds of prolonged prescription of 3.84 for 75th vs 25th percentile prescribers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Antibiotic treatment courses in long-term care facilities are often prescribed for long durations, and this appears to be influenced by prescriber preference more than patient characteristics. Future trials should evaluate antibiotic stewardship interventions targeting prescriber preferences to systematically shorten average treatment durations to reduce the complications, costs, and resistance associated with antibiotic overuse.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy Drug Administration Schedule *Drug Prescriptions Female Humans Long-Term Care Male Ontario *Physician's Practice Patterns Retrospective Studies Time Factors"

OBJECTIVE: To test methods of predicting fracture risk among women who have discontinued alendronate therapy after 4 to 5 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The prospective Fracture Intervention Trial Long-term Extension (FLEX) study randomized postmenopausal women aged 61 to 86 years previously treated with 4 to 5 years of alendronate therapy to 5 more years of alendronate or placebo from 1998 through 2003; the present analysis includes only the placebo group. Hip and spine dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were measured when placebo was begun (FLEX baseline) and after 1 to 3 years of follow-up. Two biochemical markers of bone turnover, urinary type 1 collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide (NTX) and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), were measured at FLEX baseline and after 1 and 3 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Symptomatic spine and nonspine fractures occurring after the follow-up measurement of DXA or bone turnover. RESULTS: During 5 years of placebo, 94 of 437 women (22%) experienced 1 or more symptomatic fractures; 82 had fractures after 1 year. One-year changes in hip DXA, NTX, and BAP were not related to subsequent fracture risk, but older age and lower hip DXA at time of discontinuation were significantly related to increased fracture risk (lowest tertile of baseline femoral neck DXA vs other 2 tertiles relative hazard ratio, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.38-3.41]; total hip DXA relative hazard ratio, 1.87 [95% CI, 1.20-2.92]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among postmenopausal women who discontinue alendronate therapy after 4 to 5 years, age and hip BMD at discontinuation predict clinical fractures during the subsequent 5 years. Follow-up measurements of DXA 1 year after discontinuation and of BAP or NTX 1 to 2 years after discontinuation are not associated with fracture risk and cannot be recommended.

24819824,Measuring low-value care in Medicare.,JAMA Intern Med,Schwartz AL and Landon BE and Elshaug AG and Chernew ME and McWilliams JM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Despite the importance of identifying and reducing wasteful health care use, few direct measures of overuse have been developed. Direct measures are appealing because they identify specific services to limit and can characterize low-value care even among the most efficient providers. OBJECTIVES: To develop claims-based measures of low-value services, examine service use (and associated spending) detected by these measures in Medicare, and determine whether patterns of use are related across different types of low-value services. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Drawing from evidence-based lists of services that provide minimal clinical benefit, we developed 26 claims-based measures of low-value services. Using 2009 claims for 1,360,908 Medicare beneficiaries, we assessed the proportion of beneficiaries receiving these services, mean per-beneficiary service use, and the proportion of total spending devoted to these services. We compared the amount of use and spending detected by versions of these measures with different sensitivity and specificity. We also estimated correlations between use of different services within geographic areas, adjusting for beneficiaries' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Use and spending detected by 26 measures of low-value services in 6 categories: low-value cancer screening, low-value diagnostic and preventive testing, low-value preoperative testing, low-value imaging, low-value cardiovascular testing and procedures, and other low-value surgical procedures. RESULTS: Services detected by more sensitive versions of measures affected 42% of beneficiaries and constituted 2.7% of overall annual spending. Services detected by more specific versions of measures affected 25% of beneficiaries and constituted 0.6% of overall spending. In adjusted analyses, low-value spending detected in geographic regions at the 5th percentile of the regional distribution of low-value spending ($227 per beneficiary) exceeded the difference in detected low-value spending between regions at the 5th and 95th percentiles ($189 per beneficiary). Adjusted regional use was positively correlated among 5 of 6 categories of low-value services (mean r for pairwise, between-category correlations, 0.33; range, 0.14-0.54; P </= .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Services detected by a limited number of measures of low-value care constituted modest proportions of overall spending but affected substantial proportions of beneficiaries and may be reflective of overuse more broadly. Performance of claims-based measures in supporting targeted payment or coverage policies to reduce overuse may depend heavily on how the measures are defined.",Algorithms Health Services Misuse/economics/*statistics & numerical data Humans Medicare/economics/*statistics & numerical data Sensitivity and Specificity United States
23779114,Effect of apolipoprotein E genotype and diet on apolipoprotein E lipidation and amyloid peptides: randomized clinical trial.,JAMA Neurol,Hanson AJ and Bayer-Carter JL and Green PS and Montine TJ and Wilkinson CW and Baker LD and Watson GS and Bonner LM and Callaghan M and Leverenz JB and Tsai E and Postupna N and Zhang J and Lampe J and Craft S,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) is caused in part by decreased clearance of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide breakdown products. Lipid-depleted (LD) apolipoproteins are less effective at binding and clearing Abeta, and LD Abeta peptides are more toxic to neurons. However, not much is known about the lipid states of these proteins in human cerebrospinal fluid. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the lipidation states of Abeta peptides and apolipoprotein E in the cerebrospinal fluid in adults with respect to cognitive diagnosis and APOE epsilon4 allele carrier status and after a dietary intervention. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Veterans Affairs Medical Center clinical research unit. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty older adults with normal cognition (mean [SD] age, 69 [7] years) and 27 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (67 [6] years). INTERVENTIONS: Randomization to a diet high in saturated fat content and with a high glycemic index (High diet; 45% of energy from fat [>25% saturated fat], 35%-40% from carbohydrates with a mean glycemic index >70, and 15%-20% from protein) or a diet low in saturated fat content and with a low glycemic index (Low diet; 25% of energy from fat [<7% saturated fat], 55%-60% from carbohydrates with a mean glycemic index <55, and 15%-20% from protein). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lipid-depleted Abeta42 and Abeta40 and apolipoprotein E in cerebrospinal fluid. RESULTS: Baseline levels of LD Abeta were greater for adults with mild cognitive impairment compared with adults with normal cognition (LD Abeta42, P = .05; LD Abeta40, P = .01). These findings were magnified in adults with mild cognitive impairment and the epsilon4 allele, who had higher LD apolipoprotein E levels irrespective of cognitive diagnosis (P < .001). The Low diet tended to decrease LD Abeta levels, whereas the High diet increased these fractions (LD Abeta42, P = .01; LD Abeta40, P = .15). Changes in LD Abeta levels with the Low diet negatively correlated with changes in cerebrospinal fluid levels of insulin (LD Abeta42 and insulin, r = -0.68 [P = .01]; LD Abeta40 and insulin, r = -0.78 [P = .002]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The lipidation states of apolipoproteins and Abeta peptides in the brain differ depending on APOE genotype and cognitive diagnosis. Concentrations can be modulated by diet. These findings may provide insight into the mechanisms through which apolipoprotein E4 and unhealthy diets impart risk for developing AD.",Aged Alleles Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/diet therapy/genetics Amyloid beta-Peptides/adverse effects/*cerebrospinal fluid/*metabolism Apolipoprotein E4/adverse effects/*cerebrospinal fluid/*genetics Diet/*adverse effects Dietary Fats/administration & dosage/adverse effects Double-Blind Method Female *Genotype Humans Lipid Metabolism/*genetics/physiology Male Middle Aged Mild Cognitive Impairment/diagnosis/diet therapy/genetics Peptide Fragments/adverse effects/cerebrospinal fluid/*metabolism United States

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: The 90+ Study is a population-based, longitudinal, epidemiologic study of aging and dementia performed at the University of California, Irvine, from January 1, 2003, through November 30, 2009. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 629 participants from The 90+ Study were included in the study. The mean age was 94 years, and most (72.5%) were women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause dementia, based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) criteria, was the main outcome measure. The independent variables were physical performance measures, including 4-m walk, 5 chair stands, standing balance, and grip strength, each scored from 0 to 4 (0, unable to perform; 4, best performance). Odds of dementia in relation to the physical performance measures were estimated by logistic regression after adjustment for age and sex. RESULTS Poor physical performance in all measures was significantly associated with increased odds of dementia (P< .001). Odds ratios for every unit decrease in physical performance score were 2.1 for 4-m walk, 2.1 for chair stands, 1.9 for standing balance, and 1.7 for grip strength. CONCLUSIONS: We found a strong cross-sectional relationship between poor physical performance and dementia in people 90 years and older. Our findings suggest that dementia is a complex neurodegenerative process that may affect physical performance and cognition. Additional research is necessary to determine the temporal relationship between poor physical performance and cognitive dysfunction.","Aged, 80 and over Aging/*physiology Cross-Sectional Studies Dementia/*epidemiology/physiopathology *Exercise Test Female Geriatric Assessment Humans Longitudinal Studies Male"
23676987,"Repetitive traumatic brain injury, psychological symptoms, and suicide risk in a clinical sample of deployed military personnel.",JAMA Psychiatry,Bryan CJ and Clemans TA,utah,"IMPORTANCE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is believed to be one factor contributing to rising suicide rates among military personnel and veterans. This study investigated the association of cumulative TBIs with suicide risk in a clinical sample of deployed military personnel referred for a TBI evaluation. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether suicide risk is more frequent and heightened among military personnel with multiple lifetime TBIs than among those with no TBIs or a single TBI. DESIGN: Patients completed standardized self-report measures of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal thoughts and behaviors; clinical interview; and physical examination. Group comparisons of symptom scores according to number of lifetime TBIs were made, and generalized regression analyses were used to determine the association of cumulative TBIs with suicide risk. PARTICIPANTS: Patients included 161 military personnel referred for evaluation and treatment of suspected head injury at a military hospital's TBI clinic in Iraq. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Behavioral Health Measure depression subscale, PTSD Checklist-Military Version, concussion symptoms, and Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised. RESULTS: Depression, PTSD, and TBI symptom severity significantly increased with the number of TBIs. An increased incidence of lifetime suicidal thoughts or behaviors was associated with the number of TBIs (no TBIs, 0%; single TBI, 6.9%; and multiple TBIs, 21.7%; P = .009), as was suicidal ideation within the past year (0%, 3.4%, and 12.0%, respectively; P = .04). The number of TBIs was associated with greater suicide risk (beta [SE] = .214 [.098]; P = .03) when the effects of depression, PTSD, and TBI symptom severity were controlled for. A significant interaction between depression and cumulative TBIs was also found (beta = .580 [.283]; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Suicide risk is higher among military personnel with more lifetime TBIs, even after controlling for clinical symptom severity. Results suggest that multiple TBIs, which are common among military personnel, may contribute to increased risk for suicide.","Adult Brain Injuries/complications/*psychology Depression/complications/psychology Female Humans *Iraq War, 2003-2011 Male Military Personnel/*psychology Risk Factors Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/complications/psychology Suicidal Ideation Suicide/*psychology Symptom Assessment"
24911948,Costs of autism spectrum disorders in the United Kingdom and the United States.,JAMA Pediatr,Buescher AV and Cidav Z and Knapp M and Mandell DS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The economic effect of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) on individuals with the disorder, their families, and society as a whole is poorly understood and has not been updated in light of recent findings. OBJECTIVE: To update estimates of age-specific, direct, indirect, and lifetime societal economic costs, including new findings on indirect costs, such as individual and parental productivity costs, associated with ASDs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A literature review was conducted of US and UK studies on individuals with ASDs and their families in October 2013 using the following keywords: age, autism spectrum disorder, prevalence, accommodation, special education, productivity loss, employment, costs, and economics. Current data on prevalence, level of functioning, and place of residence were combined with mean annual costs of services and support, opportunity costs, and productivity losses of individuals with ASDs with or without intellectual disability. EXPOSURE: Presence of ASDs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean annual medical, nonmedical, and indirect economic costs and lifetime costs were measured for individuals with ASDs separately for individuals with and without intellectual disability in the United States and the United Kingdom. RESULTS: The cost of supporting an individual with an ASD and intellectual disability during his or her lifespan was $2.4 million in the United States and pound1.5 million (US $2.2 million) in the United Kingdom. The cost of supporting an individual with an ASD without intellectual disability was $1.4 million in the United States and pound0.92 million (US $1.4 million) in the United Kingdom. The largest cost components for children were special education services and parental productivity loss. During adulthood, residential care or supportive living accommodation and individual productivity loss contributed the highest costs. Medical costs were much higher for adults than for children. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The substantial direct and indirect economic effect of ASDs emphasizes the need to continue to search for effective interventions that make best use of scarce societal resources. The distribution of economic effect across many different service systems raises questions about coordination of services and sectors. The enormous effect on families also warrants policy attention.",Missing

OBJECTIVES: To screen for depression in postpartum women and evaluate positive screen findings to determine the timing of episode onset, rate and intensity of self-harm ideation, and primary and secondary DSM-IV disorders to inform treatment and policy decisions. DESIGN: Sequential case series of women who recently gave birth. SETTING: Urban academic women's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: During the maternity hospitalization, women were offered screening at 4 to 6 weeks post partum by telephone. Screen-positive women were invited to undergo psychiatric evaluations in their homes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A positive screen finding was an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of 10 or higher. Self-harm ideation was assessed on EPDS item 10: ""The thought of harming myself has occurred to me"" (yes, quite often; sometimes; hardly ever; never). Screen-positive women underwent evaluation with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV for Axis I primary and secondary diagnoses. RESULTS: Ten thousand mothers underwent screening, with positive findings in 1396 (14.0%); of these, 826 (59.2%) completed the home visits and 147 (10.5%) completed a telephone diagnostic interview. Screen-positive women were more likely to be younger, African American, publicly insured, single, and less well educated. More episodes began post partum (40.1%), followed by during pregnancy (33.4%) and before pregnancy (26.5%). In this population, 19.3% had self-harm ideation. All mothers with the highest intensity of self-harm ideation were identified with the EPDS score of 10 or higher. The most common primary diagnoses were unipolar depressive disorders (68.5%), and almost two-thirds had comorbid anxiety disorders. A striking 22.6% had bipolar disorders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The most common diagnosis in screen-positive women was major depressive disorder with comorbid generalized anxiety disorder. Strategies to differentiate women with bipolar from unipolar disorders are needed.

Cognitive impairment in turn can compromise DM management and lead to hypoglycemia. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the association between hypoglycemia and dementia in a biracial cohort of older adults with DM. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective population-based study. PARTICIPANTS: We studied 783 older adults with DM (mean age, 74.0 years; 47.0% of black race/ethnicity; and 47.6% female) who were participating in the prospective population-based Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study beginning in 1997 and who had baseline Modified Mini-Mental State Examination scores of 80 or higher. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dementia diagnosis was determined during the follow-up period from hospital records indicating an admission associated with dementia or the use of prescribed dementia medications. Hypoglycemic events were determined during the follow-up period by hospital records. RESULTS: During the 12-year follow-up period, 61 participants (7.8%) had a reported hypoglycemic event, and 148 (18.9%) developed dementia. Those who experienced a hypoglycemic event had a 2-fold increased risk for developing dementia compared with those who did not have a hypoglycemic event (34.4% vs 17.6%, P < .001; multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.4). Similarly, older adults with DM who developed dementia had a greater risk for having a subsequent hypoglycemic event compared with participants who did not develop dementia (14.2% vs 6.3%, P < .001; multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.5-6.6).

23337937,The association of aspirin use with age-related macular degeneration.,JAMA Intern Med,Liew G and Mitchell P and Wong TY and Rochtchina E and Wang JJ,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether regular aspirin use is associated with a higher risk for developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by using analyzed data from a 15-year prospective cohort. METHODS: A prospective analysis was conducted of data from an Australian population-based cohort with 4 examinations during a 15-year period (1992-1994 to 2007-2009). Participants completed a detailed questionnaire at baseline assessing aspirin use, cardiovascular disease status, and AMD risk factors. Age-related macular degeneration was graded side-by-side from retinal photographs taken at each study visit to assess the incidence of neovascular (wet) AMD and geographic atrophy (dry AMD) according to the international AMD classification. RESULTS: Of 2389 baseline participants with follow-up data available, 257 individuals (10.8%) were regular aspirin users and 63 of the 2389 developed neovascular AMD. Persons who were regular aspirin users were more likely to have incident neovascular AMD: the 15-year cumulative incidence was 9.3% in users and 3.7% in nonusers. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, history of cardiovascular disease, systolic blood pressure, and body mass index, persons who were regular aspirin users had a higher risk of developing neovascular AMD (odds ratio [OR], 2.46; 95% CI, 1.25-4.83). The association showed a dose-response effect (multivariate-adjusted P = .01 for trend). Aspirin use was not associated with the incidence of geographic atrophy (multivariate-adjusted OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.59-1.65). CONCLUSION: Regular aspirin use is associated with increased risk of incident neovascular AMD, independent of a history of cardiovascular disease and smoking.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Aspirin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Australia Cardiovascular Diseases/drug therapy/prevention & control Cohort Studies Female Humans Incidence Logistic Models Macular Degeneration/classification/epidemiology/*etiology Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies Risk Factors Smoking"

OBJECTIVES: To objectively and quantitatively evaluate the degree of perceived age change and improvement in attractiveness following aesthetic facial surgical procedures. DESIGN: Prospective evaluation by independent raters of preoperative and postoperative photographs of 49 consecutive patients who underwent aesthetic facial surgery between July 4, 2006, and July 22, 2010. The photographs of these patients were presented to 50 blinded raters, each of whom was randomly assigned to 4 rater groups. Raters were asked to estimate the age of each patient in the photographs presented and to rate the patient's attractiveness on a scale of 1 to 10. SETTING: Facial plastic surgery private practice in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Patient inclusion criteria consisted of primary facial surgical procedures with a minimum 6-month follow-up period, use of standardized photographs, and no cosmetic procedures in the intervening period. Raters were chosen from the province of Ontario, randomly assigned to 1 of 4 rater groups, and blinded to the objectives of the study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The mean ""years saved"" (true age minus guessed age) and change in attractiveness scores after facial aesthetic surgery. RESULTS: The mean overall years saved following aesthetic facial surgery was 3.1 years (range, -4.0 to 9.4 years). There was a small but insignificant increase in attractiveness scores in postprocedural photographs relative to preprocedural photographs (P > .54). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, aesthetic facial surgery was effective in reducing the apparent age of patients but did not consistently improve their attractiveness.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between clinical diagnoses of noncancer pain conditions and suicide among individuals receiving services in the Department of Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis. SETTING: Data were extracted from National Death Index and treatment records from the Department of Veterans Healthcare System. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals receiving services in fiscal year 2005 who remained alive at the start of fiscal year 2006 (N = 4 863 086). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Analyses examined the association between baseline clinical diagnoses of pain-related conditions (arthritis, back pain, migraine, neuropathy, headache or tension headache, fibromyalgia, and psychogenic pain) and subsequent suicide death (assessed in fiscal years 2006-2008). RESULTS: Controlling for demographic and contextual factors (age, sex, and Charlson score), elevated suicide risks were observed for each pain condition except arthritis and neuropathy (hazard ratios ranging from 1.33 [99% CI, 1.22-1.45] for back pain to 2.61 [1.82-3.74] for psychogenic pain).

Efforts to intervene and prevent adverse childhood exposures should begin early in life but continue throughout childhood and adolescence. OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between previous adverse childhood experiences and somatic concerns and health problems in early adolescence, as well as the role of the timing of adverse exposures. DESIGN: Prospective analysis of the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect interview and questionnaire data when target children were 4, 6, 8, 12, and 14 years old. SETTING: Children with reported or at risk for maltreatment in the South, East, Midwest, Northwest, and Southwest United States Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect sites. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 933 children who completed an interview at age 14 years, including health outcomes. EXPOSURES: Eight categories of adversity (psychological maltreatment, physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, caregiver's substance use/alcohol abuse, caregiver's depressive symptoms, caregiver treated violently, and criminal behavior in the household) experienced during the first 6 years of life, the second 6 years of life, the most recent 2 years, and overall adversity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Child health problems including poor health, illness requiring a doctor, somatic concerns, and any health problem at age 14 years. RESULTS: More than 90% of the youth had experienced an adverse childhood event by age 14 years. There was a graded relationship between adverse childhood exposures and any health problem, while 2 and 3 or more adverse exposures were associated with somatic concerns. Recent adversity appeared to uniquely predict poor health, somatic concerns, and any health problem.

Increased efforts to prevent and mitigate these experiences may improve the health outcome for adolescents and adults.","Adolescent Caregivers/statistics & numerical data Child Child Abuse/psychology/*statistics & numerical data Child of Impaired Parents/psychology/*statistics & numerical data Child, Preschool Female *Health Status Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Prospective Studies Risk Factors Time Factors United States/epidemiology"
23553344,Risk factors for beta-amyloid deposition in healthy aging: vascular and genetic effects.,JAMA Neurol,Rodrigue KM and Rieck JR and Kennedy KM and Devous MD Sr and Diaz-Arrastia R and Park DC,utdallas,"IMPORTANCE: Identifying risk factors for increased beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition is important for targeting individuals most at risk for developing Alzheimer disease and informing clinical practice concerning prevention and early detection. OBJECTIVE: To investigate risk factors for Abeta deposition in cognitively healthy middle-aged and older adults. Specifically, we hypothesized that individuals with a vascular risk factor such as hypertension, in combination with a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele), would show greater amyloid burden than those without such risk. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eighteen well-screened and cognitively normal adults, aged 47 to 89 years. Participants were classified in the hypertension group if they reported a medical diagnosis of hypertension or if blood pressure exceeded 140 mm Hg systolic/90 mm Hg diastolic, as measured across 7 occasions at the time of study. INTERVENTION: Participants underwent Abeta positron emission tomography imaging with radiotracer fluorine 18-labeled florbetapir. Participants were genotyped for apolipoprotein E and were classified as epsilon4(+) or epsilon4(-). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Amyloid burden. RESULTS: Participants in the hypertension group with at least 1 epsilon4 allele showed significantly greater amyloid burden than those with only 1 risk factor or no risk factors. Furthermore, increased pulse pressure was strongly associated with increased mean cortical amyloid level for subjects with at least 1 epsilon4 allele. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vascular disease is a prevalent age-related condition that is highly responsive to both behavioral modification and medical treatment. Proper control and prevention of risk factors such as hypertension earlier in the life span may be one potential mechanism to ameliorate or delay neuropathological brain changes with aging.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Aging/*metabolism Alzheimer Disease/*genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology Amyloid beta-Peptides/*metabolism Aniline Compounds/diagnostic use Apolipoproteins E/genetics Brain/metabolism/physiopathology Cross-Sectional Studies Ethylene Glycols/diagnostic use Female Humans Hypertension/*genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology Male Middle Aged Positron-Emission Tomography/instrumentation/methods Risk Factors"
23677079,"Factors predictive of recurrence and death from cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: a 10-year, single-institution cohort study.",JAMA Dermatol,Schmults CD and Karia PS and Carter JB and Han J and Qureshi AA,partners,"IMPORTANCE: Although most cases of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) are easily cured with surgery or ablation, a subset of these tumors recur, metastasize, and cause death. We conducted the largest study of CSCC outcomes since 1968. OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors independently associated with poor outcomes in primary CSCC. DESIGN: A 10-year retrospective cohort study. SETTING: An academic hospital in Boston. PARTICIPANTS: Nine hundred eighty-five patients with 1832 tumors. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Subhazard ratios for local recurrence, nodal metastasis, disease-specific death, and all-cause death adjusted for presence of known prognostic risk factors. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 50 (range, 2-142) months. Local recurrence occurred in 45 patients (4.6%) during the study period; 36 (3.7%) developed nodal metastases; and 21 (2.1%) died of CSCC. In multivariate competing risk analyses, independent predictors for nodal metastasis and disease-specific death were a tumor diameter of at least 2 cm (subhazard ratios, 7.0 [95% CI, 2.2-21.6] and 15.9 [4.8-52.3], respectively), poor differentiation (6.1 [2.5-14.9] and 6.7 [2.7-16.5], respectively), invasion beyond fat (9.3 [2.8-31.1] and 13.0 [4.3-40.0], respectively), and ear or temple location (3.8 [1.1-13.4] and 5.9 [1.3-26.7], respectively). Perineural invasion was also associated with disease-specific death (subhazard ratio, 3.6 [95% CI, 1.1-12.0]), as was anogenital location, but few cases were anogenital. Overall death was associated with poor differentiation (subhazard ratio, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.6]) and invasion beyond fat (1.7 [1.1-2.8]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma carries a low but significant risk of metastasis and death. In this study, patients with CSCC had a 3.7% risk of metastasis and 2.1% risk of disease-specific death. Tumor diameter of at least 2 cm, invasion beyond fat, poor differentiation, perineural invasion, and ear, temple, or anogenital location were risk factors associated with poor outcomes. Accurate risk estimation of outcomes from population-based data and clinical trials proving the utility of disease-staging modalities and adjuvant therapy is needed.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Boston/epidemiology Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*mortality/*secondary Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Lymphatic Metastasis Male Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Neoplasm Grading Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*mortality Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Skin Neoplasms/*mortality/*pathology Tumor Burden"
23440131,Reassurance after diagnostic testing with a low pretest probability of serious disease: systematic review and meta-analysis.,JAMA Intern Med,Rolfe A and Burton C,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Diagnostic tests are often ordered by physicians in patients with a low pretest probability of disease to rule out conditions and reassure the patient. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of diagnostic tests on worry about illness, anxiety, symptom persistence, and subsequent use of health care resources in patients with a low pretest probability of serious illness. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations electronic databases through December 31, 2011, for eligible randomized controlled trials. We independently identified studies for inclusion and extracted the data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We performed meta-analysis if heterogeneity was low or moderate (I2 < 50%). RESULTS: Fourteen randomized controlled trials that included 3828 patients met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed with outcomes categorized as short term (</=3 months) or long term (>3 months). Three trials showed no overall effect of diagnostic tests on illness worry (odds ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.55-1.39]), and 2 showed no effect on nonspecific anxiety (standardized mean difference, 0.06 [-0.16 to 0.28]). Ten trials showed no overall long-term effect on symptom persistence (odds ratio, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.85-1.15]). Eleven trials measured subsequent primary care visits. We observed a high level of heterogeneity among trials (I2 = 80%). Meta-analysis after exclusion of outliers suggested a small reduction in visits after investigation (odds ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.62-0.96]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Diagnostic tests for symptoms with a low risk of serious illness do little to reassure patients, decrease their anxiety, or resolve their symptoms, although the tests may reduce further primary care visits. Further research is needed to maximize reassurance from medically necessary tests and to develop safe strategies for managing patients without testing when an abnormal result is unlikely.","*Anxiety/diagnosis/etiology/physiopathology Attitude to Health *Diagnostic Tests, Routine/psychology/statistics & numerical data/utilization Disease/*psychology Disease Management Humans Outcome Assessment (Health Care)/methods Probability Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Risk Assessment Severity of Illness Index Sickness Impact Profile Unnecessary Procedures/*psychology"
23567991,Elder abuse as a risk factor for hospitalization in older persons.,JAMA Intern Med,Dong X and Simon MA,rush,"IMPORTANCE: Elder abuse is associated with increased mortality risk. However, the relationship between elder abuse and health care services utilization remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between overall elder abuse and specific subtypes of elder abuse and rate of hospitalization in a community-dwelling population of older adults. DESIGN: Prospective population-based study. SETTING: Chicago Health and Aging Project. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 6674 community-dwelling older adults who participated in the Chicago Health and Aging Project, 106 were identified by social services agencies for elder abuse. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary predictor was elder abuse (reported and confirmed) reported to social services agency. The outcome of interest was the annual rate of hospitalization obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Poisson regression models were used to assess these longitudinal relationships. RESULTS: The unadjusted mean annual rate of hospitalization was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.59-0.66) for those without elder abuse and 1.97 (95% CI, 1.33-2.61) for those with reported elder abuse. After adjusting for sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables, medical comorbidities, cognitive and physical function, and psychosocial well-being, reported elder abuse had higher rates of hospitalization (rate ratio [RR], 2.00 [95% CI, 1.45-2.75]). Psychological abuse (RR, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.44-3.43]), financial exploitation (RR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.06-2.90]), caregiver neglect (RR, 2.43 [95% CI, 1.60-3.69]), and 2 or more types of elder abuse (RR, 2.59 [95% CI, 1.82-3.66]) were associated with increased rates of hospitalization, after considering the same potential confounders. Results from interaction term analyses suggested that the association between elder abuse and hospitalization did not differ across the levels of medical comorbidities, cognitive and functional impairment, or psychosocial distress. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Elder abuse was associated with increased rates of hospitalization in this community population. Future research is needed to explore the causal mechanisms between elder abuse and hospitalization. As we enter the era of health care reform, an improved understanding of factors that increase rates of hospitalization could also have significant implications for social and health policy as well as clinical care of the vulnerable patients.","African Americans/statistics & numerical data Aged Aged, 80 and over Chicago/epidemiology Comorbidity Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) Educational Status Elder Abuse/ethnology/*statistics & numerical data Female Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data Humans Illinois/epidemiology Income Independent Living Male Prospective Studies Risk Factors"
23460413,Nonbenzodiazepine sleep medication use and hip fractures in nursing home residents.,JAMA Intern Med,Berry SD and Lee Y and Cai S and Dore DD,harvard,"IMPORTANCE: It is important to understand the relationship between sleep medication use and injurious falls in nursing home residents. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a case-crossover study to estimate the association between nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug use (zolpidem tartrate, eszopiclone, or zaleplon) and the risk for hip fracture among a nationwide sample of long-stay nursing home residents, overall and stratified by individual and facility-level characteristics. DESIGN AND SETTING: Case-crossover study performed in an academic research setting. PARTICIPANTS: The study participants included 15,528 long-stay US nursing home residents 50 years or older with a hip fracture documented in Medicare Part A and Part D fee-for-service claims between July 1, 2007, and December 31, 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios (ORs) of hip fracture were estimated using conditional logistic regression models by comparing the exposure to nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs during the 0 to 29 days before the hip fracture (hazard period) with the exposure during the 60 to 89 and 120 to 149 days before the hip fracture (control periods). Analyses were stratified by individual and facility-level characteristics. RESULTS: Among the study participants, 1715 (11.0%) were dispensed a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug before the hip fracture, with 927 exposure-discordant pairs included in the analyses. The mean (SD) age of participants was 81.0 (9.7) years, and 77.6% were female. The risk for hip fracture was elevated among users of a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.45-1.90). The association between nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug use and hip fracture was somes greater in new users (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.76-2.74) and in residents with mild vs moderate to severe impairment in cognition (OR, 1.86 vs 1.43; P = .06), with moderate vs total or severe functional impairment (OR, 1.71 vs 1.16; P = .11), with limited vs full assistance required with transfers (OR, 2.02 vs 1.43; P = .02), or in a facility with fewer Medicaid beds (OR, 1.90 vs 1.46; P = .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The risk for hip fracture is elevated among nursing home residents using a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug. New users and residents having mild to moderate cognitive impairment or requiring limited assistance with transfers may be most vulnerable to the use of these drugs. Caution should be exercised when prescribing sleep medications to nursing home residents.","Administration, Oral Aged Aged, 80 and over Cross-Over Studies Drug Prescriptions/*statistics & numerical data Female Hip Fractures/*epidemiology/*etiology Humans Hypnotics and Sedatives/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects Logistic Models Male Medicare Middle Aged Mild Cognitive Impairment/complications Moving and Lifting Patients/adverse effects Nursing Homes/*statistics & numerical data Odds Ratio United States/epidemiology"

OBJECTIVE: To establish whether GBA1 mutations are a risk factor for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). DESIGN We compared genotype data on patients and controls from 11 centers. Data concerning demographics, age at onset, disease duration, and clinical and pathological features were collected when available. We conducted pooled analyses using logistic regression to investigate GBA1 mutation carrier status as predicting DLB or PD with dementia status, using common control subjects as a reference group. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to account for additional heterogeneity. SETTING: Eleven centers from sites around the world performing genotyping. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred twenty-one cases met diagnostic criteria for DLB and 151 had PD with dementia. We compared these cases with 1962 controls from the same centers matched for age, sex, and ethnicity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of GBA1 mutations in cases and controls. RESULTS We found a significant association between GBA1 mutation carrier status and DLB, with an odds ratio of 8.28 (95% CI, 4.78-14.88). The odds ratio for PD with dementia was 6.48 (95% CI, 2.53-15.37). The mean age at diagnosis of DLB was earlier in GBA1 mutation carriers than in noncarriers (63.5 vs 68.9 years; P < .001), with higher disease severity scores. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mutations in GBA1 are a significant risk factor for DLB. GBA1 mutations likely play an even larger role in the genetic etiology of DLB than in PD, providing insight into the role of glucocerebrosidase in Lewy body disease.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Case-Control Studies Female Genetic Association Studies/methods Genotype Glucosylceramidase/*genetics Humans Lewy Body Disease/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics Male Middle Aged Mutation/*genetics Risk Factors"

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of intense and long-term exercise on the physical functioning and mobility of home-dwelling patients with AD and to explore its effects on the use and costs of health and social services. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 210 home-dwelling patients with AD living with their spousal caregiver. INTERVENTIONS: The 3 trial arms included (1) group-based exercise (GE; 4-hour sessions with approximately 1-hour training) and (2) tailored home-based exercise (HE; 1-hour training), both twice a week for 1 year, and (3) a control group (CG) receiving the usual community care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Functional Independence Measure (FIM), the Short Physical Performance Battery, and information on the use and costs of social and health care services. RESULTS: All groups deteriorated in functioning during the year after randomization, but deterioration was significantly faster in the CG than in the HE or GE group at 6 (P = .003) and 12 (P = .015) months. The FIM changes at 12 months were -7.1 (95% CI, -3.7 to -10.5), -10.3 (95% CI, -6.7 to -13.9), and -14.4 (95% CI, -10.9 to -18.0) in the HE group, GE group, and CG, respectively. The HE and GE groups had significantly fewer falls than the CG during the follow-up year. The total costs of health and social services for the HE patient-caregiver dyads (in US dollars per dyad per year) were $25,112 (95% CI, $17,642 to $32,581) (P = .13 for comparison with the CG), $22,066 in the GE group ($15,931 to $28,199; P = .03 vs CG), and $34,121 ($24,559 to $43,681) in the CG. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: An intensive and long-term exercise program had beneficial effects on the physical functioning of patients with AD without increasing the total costs of health and social services or causing any significant adverse effects.

DESIGN An ecologic study of trends in the diagnosis of ADHD using the Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) health plan medical records. Rates of ADHD diagnosis were derived using Poisson regression analyses after adjustments for potential confounders. SETTING Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena. PARTICIPANTS All children who received care at the KPSC from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2010 (n = 842 830). MAIN EXPOSURE Period of ADHD diagnosis (in years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence of physician-diagnosed ADHD in children aged 5 to 11 years. RESULTS Rates of ADHD diagnosis were 2.5% in 2001 and 3.1% in 2010, a relative increase of 24%. From 2001 to 2010, the rate increased among whites (4.7%-5.6%; relative risk [RR] = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.4), blacks (2.6%- 4.1%; RR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5-1.9), and Hispanics (1.7%-2.5%; RR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5-1.7). Rates for Asian/Pacific Islander and other racial groups remained unchanged over time. The increase in ADHD diagnosis among blacks was largely driven by an increase in females (RR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.3). Although boys were more likely to be diagnosed as having ADHD than girls, results suggest the sex gap for blacks may be closing over time. Children living in high-income households were at increased risk of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that the rate of ADHD diagnosis among children in the health plan notably has increased over time. We observed disproportionately high ADHD diagnosis rates among white children and notable increases among black girls.","Age Distribution Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/diagnosis/*epidemiology/ethnology California/epidemiology Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Continental Population Groups Female Humans Incidence Income Male Regression Analysis Sex Distribution"

Interventions are needed to sustain tobacco abstinence after release from incarceration. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the extent to which the WISE intervention (Working Inside for Smoking Elimination), based on motivational interviewing (MI) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), decreases relapse to smoking after release from a smoke-free prison. DESIGN: Participants were recruited approximately 8 weeks prior to their release from a smoke-free prison and randomized to 6 weekly sessions of either education videos (control) or the WISE intervention. SETTING: A tobacco-free prison in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 262 inmates (35% female). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Continued smoking abstinence was defined as 7-day point-prevalence abstinence validated by urine cotinine measurement. RESULTS: At the 3-week follow-up, 25% of participants in the WISE intervention (31 of 122) and 7% of the control participants (9 of 125) continued to be tobacco abstinent (odds ratio [OR], 4.4; 95% CI, 2.0-9.7). In addition to the intervention, Hispanic ethnicity, a plan to remain abstinent, and being incarcerated for more than 6 months were all associated with increased likelihood of remaining abstinent. In the logistic regression analysis, participants randomized to the WISE intervention were 6.6 times more likely to remain tobacco abstinent at the 3-week follow up than those randomized to the control condition (95% CI, 2.5-17.0). Nonsmokers at the 3-week follow-up had an additional follow-up 3 months after release, and overall 12% of the participants in the WISE intervention (14 of 122) and 2% of the control participants (3 of 125) were tobacco free at 3 months, as confirmed by urine cotinine measurement (OR, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.4-23.8). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Forced tobacco abstinence alone during incarceration has little impact on postrelease smoking status. A behavioral intervention provided prior to release greatly improves cotinine-confirmed smoking cessation in the community.

The identification of other risk factors could improve the understanding of this heterogeneous group of syndromes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate risk factors in late adolescence for the development of YOD later in life. DESIGN: We identified the study cohort from the Swedish Military Service Conscription Register from January 1, 1969, through December 31, 1979. Potential risk factors, such as cognitive function and different physical characteristics, were assessed at conscription. We collected other risk factors, including dementia in parents, through national register linkage. PARTICIPANTS: All Swedish men conscripted for mandatory military service (n=488,484) with a mean age of 18 years. SETTING: Predominantly Swedish men born from January 1, 1950, through December 31, 1960. EXPOSURE: Potential risk factors for dementia based on those found in previous studies, data available, and quality of register data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE: All forms of YOD. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 37 years, 487 men were diagnosed as having YOD at a median age of 54 years. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, significant risk factors (all P< .05) for YOD included alcohol intoxication (hazard ratio, 4.82 [95% CI, 3.83-6.05]); population-attributable risk, 0.28), stroke (2.96 [2.02-4.35]; 0.04), use of antipsychotics (2.75 [2.09-3.60]; 0.12), depression (1.89 [1.53-2.34]; 0.28), father's dementia (1.65 [1.22-2.24]; 0.04), drug intoxication other than alcohol (1.54 [1.06-2.24]; 0.03), low cognitive function at conscription (1.26 per 1-SD decrease [1.14-1.40]; 0.29), low height at conscription (1.16 per 1-SD decrease [1.04-1.29]; 0.16), and high systolic blood pressure at conscription (0.90 per 1-SD decrease [0.82-0.99]; 0.06). The population-attributable risk associated with all 9 risk factors was 68%.

DESIGN: A retrospective, population-based study using data obtained from the 2009 Area Resource File and Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program. SETTING: Each county in the United States. PATIENTS: Black and white populations per US county. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A generalized linear model with a Poisson distribution and log link was used to examine the association between residential segregation and lung cancer mortality from 2003 to 2007 for black and white populations. Our primary independent variable was the racial index of dissimilarity. The index is a demographic measure that assesses the evenness with which whites and blacks are distributed across census tracts within each county. The score ranges from 0 to 100 in increasing degrees of residential segregation. RESULTS The overall lung cancer mortality rate was higher for blacks than whites (58.9% vs 52.4% per 100 000 population). Each additional level of segregation was associated with a 0.5% increase in lung cancer mortality for blacks (P < .001) and an associated decrease in mortality for whites (P = .002). Adjusted lung cancer mortality rates among blacks were 52.4% and 62.9% per 100 000 population in counties with the least (<40% segregation) and the highest levels of segregation (>/=60% segregation), respectively. In contrast, the adjusted lung cancer mortality rates for whites decreased with increasing levels of segregation.

23478992,Potentially inappropriate screening colonoscopy in Medicare patients: variation by physician and geographic region.,JAMA Intern Med,Sheffield KM and Han Y and Kuo YF and Riall TS and Goodwin JS,utmb,"IMPORTANCE: Inappropriate use of colonoscopy involves unnecessary risk for older patients and consumes resources that could be used more effectively. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of potentially inappropriate colonoscopy in Medicare beneficiaries in Texas and to examine variation among physicians and across geographic regions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used 100% Medicare claims data for Texas and a 5% sample from the United States from 2000 through 2009. We identified Medicare beneficiaries aged 70 years or older who underwent a colonoscopy from October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Colonoscopies were classified as screening in the absence of a diagnosis suggesting an indication for the procedure. Screening colonoscopy was considered potentially inappropriate on the basis of patient age or occurrence too soon after colonoscopy with negative findings. The percentage of patients undergoing potentially inappropriate screening colonoscopy was estimated for each colonoscopist and hospital service area. RESULTS: A large percentage of colonoscopies performed in older adults were potentially inappropriate: 23.4% for the overall Texas cohort and 9.9%, 38.8%, and 24.9%, respectively, in patients aged 70 to 75, 76 to 85, or 86 years or older. There was considerable variation across the 797 colonoscopists in the percentages of colonoscopies performed that were potentially inappropriate. In a multilevel model including patient sex, race or ethnicity, number of comorbid conditions, educational level, and urban or rural residence, 73 colonoscopists had percentages significantly above the mean (23.9%), ranging from 28.7% to 45.5%, and 119 had percentages significantly below the mean (23.9%), ranging from 6.7% to 18.6%. The colonoscopists with percentages significantly above the mean were more likely to be surgeons, graduates of US medical schools, medical school graduates before 1990, and higher-volume colonoscopists than those with percentages significantly below the mean. Colonoscopist rankings were fairly stable over time (2006-2007 vs 2008-2009). There was also geographic variation across Texas and the United States, with percentages ranging from 13.3% to 34.9% in Texas and from 19.5% to 30.5% across the United States. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Many colonoscopies performed in older adults may be inappropriate. The likelihood of undergoing potentially inappropriate colonoscopy depends in part on where patients live and what physician they see.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Attitude of Health Personnel Cohort Studies *Colonoscopy/economics/statistics & numerical data Female Health Services Misuse/*statistics & numerical data Humans Male *Medicare Regression Analysis Retrospective Studies Texas United States"

RESULTS Probands had significantly worse educational, occupational, economic, and social outcomes; more divorces; and higher rates of ongoing ADHD (22.2% vs 5.1%, P &lt; .001), ASPD (16.3% vs 0%, P &lt; .001), and SUDs (14.1% vs 5.1%, P = .01) but not more mood or anxiety disorders (P = .36 and .33) than did comparison participants. Ongoing ADHD was weakly related to ongoing SUDs (varphi = 0.19, P = .04), as well as ASPD with SUDs (varphi = 0.20, P = .04). During their lifetime, probands had significantly more ASPD and SUDs but not mood or anxiety disorders and more psychiatric hospitalizations and incarcerations than comparison participants. Relative to comparisons, psychiatric disorders with onsets at 21 years or older were not significantly elevated in probands. Probands without ongoing psychiatric disorders had worse social, but not occupational, functioning. CONCLUSIONS The multiple disadvantages predicted by childhood ADHD well into adulthood began in adolescence, without increased onsets of new disorders after 20 years of age. Findings highlight the importance of extended monitoring and treatment of children with ADHD.",Missing
23549661,Nurse staffing and NICU infection rates.,JAMA Pediatr,Rogowski JA and Staiger D and Patrick T and Horbar J and Kenny M and Lake ET,umdnj,"IMPORTANCE: There are substantial shortfalls in nurse staffing in US neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) relative to national guidelines. These are associated with higher rates of nosocomial infections among infants with very low birth weights. OBJECTIVE: To study the adequacy of NICU nurse staffing in the United States using national guidelines and analyze its association with infant outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. Data for 2008 were collected by web survey of staff nurses. Data for 2009 were collected for 4 shifts in 4 calendar quarters (3 in 2009 and 1 in 2010). SETTING: Sixty-seven US NICUs from the Vermont Oxford Network, a national voluntary network of hospital NICUs. PARTICIPANTS: All inborn very low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants, with a NICU stay of at least 3 days, discharged from the NICUs in 2008 (n = 5771) and 2009 (n = 5630). All staff-registered nurses with infant assignments. EXPOSURES: We measured nurse understaffing relative to acuity-based guidelines using 2008 survey data (4046 nurses and 10 394 infant assignments) and data for 4 complete shifts (3645 nurses and 8804 infant assignments) in 2009-2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: An infection in blood or cerebrospinal fluid culture occurring more than 3 days after birth among VLBW inborn infants. The hypothesis was formulated prior to data collection. RESULTS: Hospitals understaffed 31% of their NICU infants and 68% of high-acuity infants relative to guidelines. To meet minimum staffing guidelines on average would require an additional 0.11 of a nurse per infant overall and 0.34 of a nurse per high-acuity infant. Very low-birth-weight infant infection rates were 16.4% in 2008 and 13.9% in 2009. A 1 standard deviation-higher understaffing level (SD, 0.11 in 2008 and 0.08 in 2009) was associated with adjusted odds ratios of 1.39 (95% CI, 1.19-1.62; P < .001) in 2008 and 1.40 (95% CI, 1.19-1.65; P < .001) in 2009. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Substantial NICU nurse understaffing relative to national guidelines is widespread. Understaffing is associated with an increased risk for VLBW nosocomial infection. Hospital administrators and NICU managers should assess their staffing decisions to devote needed nursing care to critically ill infants.","Cross Infection/*epidemiology/prevention & control Female *Guideline Adherence Humans Infant, Newborn *Infant, Very Low Birth Weight Likelihood Functions Logistic Models Male Multivariate Analysis Neonatal Nursing Nursing Staff, Hospital/*supply & distribution Patient Acuity *Personnel Staffing and Scheduling Retrospective Studies Risk United States/epidemiology"
24322569,Overdiagnosis in low-dose computed tomography screening for lung cancer.,JAMA Intern Med,Patz EF Jr and Pinsky P and Gatsonis C and Sicks JD and Kramer BS and Tammemagi MC and Chiles C and Black WC and Aberle DR,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Screening for lung cancer has the potential to reduce mortality, but in addition to detecting aggressive tumors, screening will also detect indolent tumors that otherwise may not cause clinical symptoms. These overdiagnosis cases represent an important potential harm of screening because they incur additional cost, anxiety, and morbidity associated with cancer treatment. OBJECTIVE: To estimate overdiagnosis in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data from the NLST, a randomized trial comparing screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) vs chest radiography (CXR) among 53 452 persons at high risk for lung cancer observed for 6.4 years, to estimate the excess number of lung cancers in the LDCT arm of the NLST compared with the CXR arm. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We calculated 2 measures of overdiagnosis: the probability that a lung cancer detected by screening with LDCT is an overdiagnosis (PS), defined as the excess lung cancers detected by LDCT divided by all lung cancers detected by screening in the LDCT arm; and the number of cases that were considered overdiagnosis relative to the number of persons needed to screen to prevent 1 death from lung cancer. RESULTS: During follow-up, 1089 lung cancers were reported in the LDCT arm and 969 in the CXR arm of the NLST. The probability is 18.5% (95% CI, 5.4%-30.6%) that any lung cancer detected by screening with LDCT was an overdiagnosis, 22.5% (95% CI, 9.7%-34.3%) that a non-small cell lung cancer detected by LDCT was an overdiagnosis, and 78.9% (95% CI, 62.2%-93.5%) that a bronchioalveolar lung cancer detected by LDCT was an overdiagnosis. The number of cases of overdiagnosis found among the 320 participants who would need to be screened in the NLST to prevent 1 death from lung cancer was 1.38. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: More than 18% of all lung cancers detected by LDCT in the NLST seem to be indolent, and overdiagnosis should be considered when describing the risks of LDCT screening for lung cancer.","Aged Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/mortality/*radiography Diagnosis, Differential *Diagnostic Errors Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Lung Neoplasms/mortality/*radiography Male Mass Screening/*methods Middle Aged Probability Prospective Studies Reproducibility of Results Survival Rate/trends Time Factors Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods United States/epidemiology"
23420383,Association of hospice patients' income and care level with place of death.,JAMA Intern Med,Barclay JS and Kuchibhatla M and Tulsky JA and Johnson KS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Terminally ill patients with lower incomes are less likely to die at home, even with hospice care. OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between income and transfer from home before death and the interaction between income and level of hospice care as a predictor of transfer from home in patients admitted to routine home hospice care. DESIGN: We matched zip codes to US census tracts to generate median annual household incomes and divided the measure into $10,000 increments (</=$20,000 to >$50,000). We abstracted data from the central administrative and clinical database of a hospice care provider. We analyzed the relationship between income and transfer from home before death using logistic regression adjusted for demographics, diagnosis, region, and length of stay. Level of hospice care was examined as any continuous care vs none. Unlike routine care, which includes periodic visits by hospice, continuous care is a higher level of care used for short periods of crisis to keep a patient at home and includes hospice services in the home at least 8 hours in a 24-hour period. SETTING: A for-profit hospice provider, VITAS Healthcare, operating 26 programs in 8 states. PARTICIPANTS: Hospice patients admitted to routine care in a private residence from January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2003. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Transfer from hospice care in a private residence to hospice care in a site outside the home before death. RESULTS: Of the 61,063 enrollees admitted to routine care in a private residence, 13,804 (22.61%) transferred from home to another location (ie, inpatient hospice unit or nursing home) with hospice care before death. Patients who transferred had a lower mean median household income ($42,585 vs $46,777; P < .001) and were less likely to have received any continuous care (49.38% vs 30.61%; P < .001). The median number of days of continuous care was 4. For patients who did not receive continuous care, the odds of transfer from home before death increased with decreasing median annual household incomes (odds ratio range, 1.26-1.76). For patients who received continuous care, income was not a predictor of transfer from home. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with limited resources may be less likely to die at home, especially if they are not able to access needed support beyond what is available with routine hospice care.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Causality Death Female Home Care Services/*economics Hospice Care/*economics *Hospices/economics/standards Humans *Income/classification/statistics & numerical data Male Multivariate Analysis Patient Transfer Poverty/ethnology/statistics & numerical data Terminally Ill/*statistics & numerical data United States/epidemiology"

To address the health threat, as well as the economic burden, primary prevention and early detection are crucial. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of a topical sunscreen in the prevention of UV-induced effects in nevi. DESIGN: Prospective study of nevi protected by sunscreen vs a physical barrier. SETTING AND PATIENTS: Twenty-three nevi from 20 patients attending a referral hospital. INTERVENTION: Half of each nevus was protected by either a physical barrier or a sunscreen. Lesions were completely irradiated by a single dose of UV-B. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In vivo examination before and 7 days after irradiation and histopathologic-immunopathologic evaluation after excision on the seventh day. RESULTS: The most frequent clinical changes after UV radiation were pigmentation, scaling, and erythema; the most frequent dermoscopic changes were increased globules/dots, blurred network, regression, and dotted vessels. Both physical barrier- and sunscreen-protected areas showed some degree of these changes. More than 30% (7) of nevi did not show any change on clinical examination, and 18% (4) had no dermoscopic change. Immunohistopathologic differences between the halves of each nevus were demonstrable even when in vivo examination detected nothing. Parakeratotic scale, increased number and activation of superficial melanocytes, and keratinocyte proliferation were the most remarkable features. The only difference between both barriers was more enhanced melanocytic activation and regression features in the sunscreen group. No phenotypic features were found to predict a specific UV-B response. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Both physical barriers and sunscreens can partially prevent UV-B effects on nevi. Subclinical UV radiation effects, not always associated with visible changes, can develop even after protection. Sunscreens are not quite as effective as physical barriers in the prevention of inflammatory UV-B-induced effects.",Adult Dermoscopy Female Humans Immunohistochemistry MART-1 Antigen/metabolism Male Melanocytes/metabolism Melanoma-Specific Antigens/metabolism Middle Aged Nevus/metabolism/*pathology Prospective Studies Skin/metabolism/pathology/radiation effects Skin Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology *Sunscreening Agents Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects Young Adult
23479184,Sleep quality and preclinical Alzheimer disease.,JAMA Neurol,Ju YE and McLeland JS and Toedebusch CD and Xiong C and Fagan AM and Duntley SP and Morris JC and Holtzman DM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Sleep and circadian problems are very common in Alzheimer disease (AD). Recent animal studies suggest a bidirectional relationship between sleep and beta-amyloid (Abeta), a key molecule involved in AD pathogenesis. OBJECTIVE: To test whether Abeta deposition in preclinical AD, prior to the appearance of cognitive impairment, is associated with changes in quality or quantity of sleep. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study conducted from October 2010 to June 2012. SETTING: General community volunteers at the Washington University Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. PARTICIPANTS: Cognitively normal individuals (n = 145) 45 years and older were recruited from longitudinal studies of memory and aging at the Washington University Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Valid actigraphy data were recorded in 142. The majority (124 of 142) were recruited from the Adult Children Study, in which all were aged 45 to 75 years at baseline and 50% have a parental history of late-onset AD. The rest were recruited from a community volunteer cohort in which all were older than 60 years and healthy at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sleep was objectively measured using actigraphy for 2 weeks. Sleep efficiency, which is the percentage of time in bed spent asleep, was the primary measure of sleep quality. Total sleep time was the primary measure of sleep quantity. Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 levels were used to determine whether amyloid deposition was present or absent. Concurrent sleep diaries provided nap information. RESULTS: Amyloid deposition, as assessed by Abeta42 levels, was present in 32 participants (22.5%). This group had worse sleep quality, as measured by sleep efficiency (80.4% vs 83.7%), compared with those without amyloid deposition, after correction for age, sex, and APOEepsilon4 allele carrier status (P = .04). In contrast, quantity of sleep was not significantly different between groups, as measured by total sleep time. Frequent napping, 3 or more days per week, was associated with amyloid deposition (31.2% vs 14.7%; P = .03).

Recognizing and alleviating factors of parent distress may improve overall family survivorship experiences following childhood cancer. OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence and factors of psychological distress (PD) among parents of children with advanced cancer. DESIGN: Cohort study embedded within a randomized clinical trial (Pediatric Quality of Life and Evaluation of Symptoms Technology [PediQUEST] study). SETTING: Multicenter study conducted at 3 children's hospitals (Boston Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and Seattle Children's Hospital). PARTICIPANTS: Parents of children with advanced (progressive, recurrent, or refractory) cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Parental PD, as measured by the Kessler-6 Psychological Distress Scale. RESULTS: Eighty-six of 104 parents completed the Survey About Caring for Children With Cancer (83% participation); 81 parents had complete Kessler-6 Psychological Distress Scale data. More than 50% of parents reported high PD and 16% met criteria for serious PD (compared with US prevalence of 2%-3%). Parent perceptions of prognosis, goals of therapy, child symptoms/suffering, and financial hardship were associated with PD. In multivariate analyses, average parent Kessler-6 Psychological Distress Scale scores were higher among parents who believed their child was suffering highly and who reported great economic hardship. Conversely, PD was significantly lower among parents whose prognostic understanding was aligned with concrete goals of care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Parenting a child with advanced cancer is strongly associated with high to severe levels of PD. Interventions aimed at aligning prognostic understanding with concrete care goals and easing child suffering and financial hardship may mitigate parental PD.","Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Female Health Surveys Humans Linear Models Logistic Models Male Multivariate Analysis Neoplasms/*psychology Parents/*psychology Prevalence Psychological Tests Risk Factors Stress, Psychological/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology"

OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and correlates of repeat lipid testing in patients with CHD who attained low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals and received no treatment intensification. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We assessed the proportion of patients with LDL-C levels of less than 100 mg/dL and no intensification of lipid-lowering therapy who underwent repeat lipid testing during an 11-month follow-up period. We performed logistic regression analyses to evaluate facility, provider, and patient characteristics associated with repeat testing. In total, we analyzed 35,191 patients with CHD in a Veterans Affairs network of 7 medical centers with associated community-based outpatient clinics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Frequency and correlates of repeat lipid testing in patients having CHD with LDL-C levels of less than 100 mg/dL and no further treatment intensification with lipid-lowering therapies. RESULTS: Of 27,947 patients with LDL-C levels of less than 100 mg/dL, 9200 (32.9%) had additional lipid assessments without treatment intensification during the following 11 months (12 ,686 total additional panels; mean, 1.38 additional panel per patient). Adjusting for facility-level clustering, patients with a history of diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; 95% CI, 1.10-1.22), a history of hypertension (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.13-1.30), higher illness burden (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.23-1.57), and more frequent primary care visits (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.25-1.39) were more likely to undergo repeat testing, whereas patients receiving care at a teaching facility (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.69-0.80) or from a physician provider (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98) and those with a medication possession ratio of 0.8 or higher (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.71-0.80) were less likely to undergo repeat testing. Among 13,114 patients who met the optional LDL-C target level of less than 70 mg/dL, repeat lipid testing was performed in 8177 (62.4% of those with LDL-C levels of <70 mg/dL) during 11 follow-up months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: One-third of patients having CHD with LDL-C levels at goal underwent repeat lipid panels. Our results highlight areas for quality improvement initiatives to reduce redundant lipid testing. These efforts would be more important if the forthcoming cholesterol guidelines adopt a medication dose-based approach in place of the current treat-to-target approach.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Cholesterol, LDL/*blood Coronary Artery Disease/*blood/drug therapy Female Humans Hypolipidemic Agents/*therapeutic use Lipids/*blood Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Risk Factors Treatment Outcome"

Additionally, the study gives insight into factors other than reduced lung function that are also associated with persistent wheeze in young adults. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that reduced lung function in early life is associated with increased risk for persistent wheeze at age 18 years. DESIGN: Birth cohort study. SETTING: Perth, Western Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals followed up from age 1 month to 18 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maximal flow at functional residual capacity (V'maxFRC) was measured in 1-month-old infants who were followed up at ages 6, 12, and 18 years. Based on reported symptoms, individuals were categorized as having remittent wheeze, later-onset wheeze, persistent wheeze, and no wheeze. Smoking status was noted at age 18 years. RESULTS: Of the 253 individuals originally recruited, 150 were followed up at age 18 years; 37 of the 150 had recent wheeze. Compared with the no-wheeze group (n = 96), persistent wheeze (n = 13) was independently associated with reduced percentage of predicted V'maxFRC (mean reduction, 43%; 95% CI, 13-74). Compared with the no-wheeze group, persistent wheeze was also associated with atopy in infancy (odds ratio = 7.1; 95% CI, 1.5-34.5), maternal asthma (odds ratio = 6.8; 95% CI, 1.4-32.3), and active smoking (odds ratio = 4.8; 95% CI, 1.0-21.3). When only wheeze at age 18 years was considered, reduced percentage of predicted V'maxFRC was associated with wheeze at age 18 years only among current smokers (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Wheeze persisting from ages 6 to 18 years is associated with multiple factors, including reduced infant lung function, infant-onset atopy, maternal asthma, and active smoking. Wheeze at age 18 years (regardless of previous wheeze status) is associated with active smoking, but only among those with reduced lung function in infancy. These findings give unique insight into the cause of obstructive airways disease in 18-year-olds, and follow-up of this cohort might be expected to further extend our understanding.",Adolescent Age of Onset Child Female Follow-Up Studies Functional Residual Capacity Humans Infant Logistic Models Lung/*physiology Male Respiratory Function Tests Respiratory Sounds/*physiopathology Smoking/*physiopathology Spirometry

Predictors of persistent OSA after adenotonsillectomy (T&A) in younger children are not well studied. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate residual OSA in a subgroup of children younger than 3 years after T&A and identify predictors of postoperative residual disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective review of medical records at a tertiary academic children's hospital involving children younger than 3 years who had OSA documented by polysomnogram(PSG) and underwent T&A during the period October 1, 2002, through June 30, 2010. Some of these children had both preoperative and postoperative PSGs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Effect of T&A on sleep study parameters and predictors of persistent disease after surgery. RESULTS A total of 283 patients (mean [SD] age, 22 [7] months) underwent a preoperative PSG, with 70 of these patients having both a preoperative and postoperative PSG. In the group who had preoperative and postoperative PSGs, there were statistically significant improvements in mean (SD) apnea hypopnea index (AHI) (34.8 [40.7] to 5.7 [13.8]; P < .001), baseline oxygen saturation (96.6%[2.1%] to 97.2%[1.4%]; P = .05), minimum oxygen saturation (77.2%[11.4%] to 89.9%[6.8%]; P < .001), and sleep efficiency (84.7%[14.9%] to 88.7%[9.1%]; P = .02) after T&A. When AHI greater than 5 was used as the definition of OSA, 21% of the patients (15 of 70) had residual OSA. The most consistent predictor of residual OSA after T&A was the severity of preoperative OSA (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a subgroup of children younger than 3 years with OSA, we found a high rate of residual OSA after T&A. Predictors of residual disease include severity of preoperative OSA as determined by PSG result.

Results have immediate implications because of the ongoing implementation of new nutrition standards for the National School Lunch Program. OBJECTIVE To determine if state laws with stricter school meal nutrition standards are inversely associated with adolescent weight status, while controlling for unmeasured state-level confounders. DESIGN: Quasi-experiment. SETTING: Public schools. PARTICIPANTS: Four thousand eight hundred seventy eighth-grade students in 40 states. Students were categorized by type of school lunch they usually obtained (free/reduced price, regular price, or none). INTERVENTIONS State laws governing school meal nutrition standards. States with standards that exceeded US Department of Agriculture (USDA) school meal standards were compared with states that did not exceed USDA standards. The parameter of interest was the interaction between state laws and student lunch participant status, ie, whether disparities in weight status between school lunch participants and nonparticipants were smaller in states with stricter standards. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body mass index percentile and obesity status. RESULTS: In states that exceeded USDA standards, the difference in obesity prevalence between students who obtained free/reduced-price lunches and students who did not obtain school lunches was 12.3 percentage points smaller (95% CI, -21.5 to -3.0) compared with states that did not exceed USDA standards. Likewise, differences in mean body mass index percentile between those student populations were 11 units smaller in states that exceeded USDA standards (95% CI, -17.7 to -4.3). There was little evidence that students compensated for school meal laws by purchasing more sweets, salty snacks, or sugar-sweetened beverages from other school venues (eg, vending machines) or other sources (eg, fast food). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Stringent school meal standards that reflect the latest nutrition science may improve weight status among school lunch participants, particularly those eligible for free/reduced-price lunches.","Adolescent Adolescent Behavior *Body Mass Index Diet Female Health Surveys Humans *Lunch Male Models, Statistical Nutrition Policy/*legislation & jurisprudence Obesity/epidemiology/*prevention & control Prevalence School Health Services/legislation & jurisprudence/*standards *State Government United States/epidemiology United States Department of Agriculture/*standards"

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the natural history of AD and determine the persistence of symptoms over time. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional and cohort study of a nation-wide long-term registry of children with AD enrolled in the Pediatric Eczema Elective Registry (PEER). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported outcome of whether a child's skin was AD symptom-free for 6 months at 6-month intervals. RESULTS: A total of 7157 patients were enrolled in the PEER study for a total of 22,550 person-years. At least 2 years of follow-up were observed for 4248 children and at least 5 years of follow-up were observed for 2416 children. Multiple demographic and exposure variables were associated with more persistent AD. At every age (ie, 2-26 years), more than 80% of PEER participants had symptoms of AD and/or were using medication to treat their AD. It was not until age 20 years that 50% of patients had at least 1 lifetime 6-month symptom- and treatment-free period. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Based on this large longitudinal cohort study, symptoms associated with AD seem to persist well into the second decade of a child's life and likely longer. Atopic dermatitis is probably a life-long illness.","Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Dermatitis, Atopic/*diagnosis Eczema/diagnosis Female Humans Male Prospective Studies Risk Factors Severity of Illness Index Young Adult"

Research is needed to understand developmental processes that link newly discovered genetic risks with adult heavy smoking. OBJECTIVE: To test how genetic risks discovered in genome-wide association studies of adult smoking influence the developmental progression of smoking behavior from initiation through conversion to daily smoking, progression to heavy smoking, nicotine dependence, and struggles with cessation. DESIGN: A 38-year, prospective, longitudinal study of a representative birth cohort. SETTING: The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study of New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: The study included 1037 male and female participants. EXPOSURE: We assessed genetic risk with a multilocus genetic risk score. The genetic risk score was composed of single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified in 3 meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies of smoking quantity phenotypes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Smoking initiation, conversion to daily smoking, progression to heavy smoking, nicotine dependence (Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence), and cessation difficulties were evaluated at 8 assessments spanning the ages of 11 to 38 years. RESULTS: Genetic risk score was unrelated to smoking initiation. However, individuals at higher genetic risk were more likely to convert to daily smoking as teenagers, progressed more rapidly from smoking initiation to heavy smoking, persisted longer in smoking heavily, developed nicotine dependence more frequently, were more reliant on smoking to cope with stress, and were more likely to fail in their cessation attempts. Further analysis revealed that 2 adolescent developmental phenotypes-early conversion to daily smoking and rapid progression to heavy smoking-mediated associations between the genetic risk score and mature phenotypes of persistent heavy smoking, nicotine dependence, and cessation failure. The genetic risk score predicted smoking risk over and above family history. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Initiatives that disrupt the developmental progression of smoking behavior among adolescents may mitigate genetic risks for developing adult smoking problems. Future genetic research may maximize discovery potential by focusing on smoking behavior soon after smoking initiation and by studying young smokers.","Adolescent Adolescent Development/drug effects/physiology Adult Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Disease Progression Female Humans Longitudinal Studies Male New Zealand/epidemiology Risk Smoking/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology Time Factors Tobacco Use Disorder/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology Young Adult"

Three ultrasound nodule characteristics--microcalcifications (odds ratio [OR], 8.1; 95% CI, 3.8-17.3), size greater than 2 cm (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.7-7.6), and an entirely solid composition (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.7-9.2)--were the only findings associated with the risk of thyroid cancer. If 1 characteristic is used as an indication for biopsy, most cases of thyroid cancer would be detected (sensitivity, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80-0.94), with a high false-positive rate (0.44; 95% CI, 0.43-0.45) and a low positive likelihood ratio (2.0; 95% CI, 1.8-2.2), and 56 biopsies will be performed per cancer diagnosed. If 2 characteristics were required for biopsy, the sensitivity and false-positive rates would be lower (sensitivity, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42-0.62; false-positive rate, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.07-0.08), the positive likelihood ratio would be higher (7.1; 95% CI, 6.2-8.2), and only 16 biopsies will be performed per cancer diagnosed. Compared with performing biopsy of all thyroid nodules larger than 5 mm, adoption of this more stringent rule requiring 2 abnormal nodule characteristics to prompt biopsy would reduce unnecessary biopsies by 90% while maintaining a low risk of cancer (5 per 1000 patients for whom biopsy is deferred). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Thyroid ultrasound imaging could be used to identify patients who have a low risk of cancer for whom biopsy could be deferred. On the basis of these results, these findings should be validated in a large prospective cohort.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Case-Control Studies Female Humans Male Middle Aged Registries Retrospective Studies Risk Sensitivity and Specificity Thyroid Gland/pathology/*ultrasonography Thyroid Neoplasms/pathology/*ultrasonography Thyroid Nodule/pathology/*ultrasonography"
23699865,Prevalence of allergic disease in foreign-born American children.,JAMA Pediatr,Silverberg JI and Simpson EL and Durkin HG and Joks R,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Improved understanding of allergic disease epidemiology lead to novel therapeutic and prevention strategies. OBJECTIVES: To study the association between US birthplace and prevalence of childhood allergic disease and to determine the effects of prolonged US residence on allergic disease. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional questionnaire distributed to 91, 642 children aged 0 to 17 years enrolled in the 2007-2008 National Survey of Children's Health. EXPOSURE: Place of birth. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Prevalence of allergic disease, including asthma, eczema, hay fever, and food allergies. RESULTS: Children born outside the United States had significantly lower odds of any atopic disorders than those born in the United States (logistic regression OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.38-0.61), including ever-asthma (0.53; 0.39-0.72), current-asthma (0.34; 0.23-0.51), eczema (0.43; 0.30-0.61), hay fever (0.39; 0.27-0.55), and food allergies (0.60; 0.37-0.99). The associations between child's birthplace and atopic disorders remained significant in multivariate models including age, sex, race/ethnicity, annual household income, residence in metropolitan areas, and history of child moving to a new address. Children born outside the United States whose parents were also born outside the United States had significantly lower odds of any atopic disorders than those whose parents were born in the United States (P = .005). Children born outside the United States who lived in the United States for longer than 10 years when compared with those who resided for only 0 to 2 years had significantly higher odds of developing any allergic disorders (adjusted OR, 3.04; 95% CI, 1.08-8.60), including eczema (4.93; 1.18-20.62; P = .03) and hay fever (6.25; 1.70-22.96) but not asthma or food allergies (P >/= .06). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children born outside the United States have a lower prevalence allergic disease that increases after residing in the United States for 1 decade.","Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Cross-Sectional Studies *Emigrants and Immigrants Female Health Surveys Humans Hypersensitivity, Immediate/*ethnology Infant Infant, Newborn Logistic Models Male Multivariate Analysis Odds Ratio Prevalence Questionnaires *Residence Characteristics Time Factors United States/epidemiology"
23546607,Use of glucocorticoids and risk of venous thromboembolism: a nationwide population-based case-control study.,JAMA Intern Med,Johannesdottir SA and Horvath-Puho E and Dekkers OM and Cannegieter SC and Jorgensen JO and Ehrenstein V and Vandenbroucke JP and Pedersen L and Sorensen HT,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Excess endogenous cortisol has been linked to venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk, but whether this relationship applies to exogenous glucocorticoids remains uncertain. Because the prevalence of glucocorticoid use and the incidence of VTE are high, an increased risk of VTE associated with glucocorticoid use would have important implications. BACKGROUND: To examine the association between glucocorticoid use and VTE. DESIGN: Population-based case-control study using nationwide databases. SETTING: Denmark (population 5.6 million). PARTICIPANTS: We identified 38,765 VTE cases diagnosed from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2011, and 387,650 population controls included through risk-set sampling and matched by birth year and sex. The VTE diagnosis date for the case was the index date for cases and matched controls. EXPOSURE: We classified individuals who filled their most recent glucocorticoid prescription 90 days or less, 91 to 365 days, and more than 365 days before the index date as present, recent, and former users, respectively. Present users were subdivided into new (first-ever prescription 90 days or less before the index date) and continuing users (others). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We used conditional logistic regression adjusted for VTE risk factors to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs for glucocorticoid users vs nonusers. RESULTS: Systemic glucocorticoids increased VTE risk among present (adjusted IRR, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.18-2.45), new (3.06; 2.77-3.38), continuing (2.02; 1.88-2.17), and recent (1.18; 1.10-1.26) users but not among former users (0.94; 0.90-0.99). The adjusted IRR increased from 1.00 (95% CI, 0.93-1.07) for a prednisolone-equivalent cumulative dose of 10 mg or less to 1.98 (1.78-2.20) for more than 1000 to 2000 mg, and to 1.60 (1.49-1.71) for doses higher than 2000 mg. New use of inhaled (adjusted IRR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.72-2.86) and intestinal-acting (2.17; 1.27-3.71) glucocorticoids also increased VTE risk. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The risk of VTE is increased among glucocorticoid users. Although residual confounding may partly explain this finding, we consider a biological mechanism likely because the association followed a clear temporal gradient, persisted after adjustment for indicators of severity of underlying disease, and existed also for noninflammatory conditions.

The impact of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease, visualized as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on magnetic resonance imaging scans, may be a key factor that contributes independently to AD presentation. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of WMHs and Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) positron-emission tomography-derived amyloid positivity on the clinical expression of AD. DESIGN: Baseline PIB-positron-emission tomography values were downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Total WMH volume was derived on accompanying structural magnetic resonance imaging data. We examined whether PIB positivity and total WMHs predicted diagnostic classification of patients with AD (n = 20) and control subjects (n = 21). A second analysis determined whether WMHs discriminated between those with and without the clinical diagnosis of AD among those who were classified as PIB positive (n = 28). A third analysis examined whether WMHs, in addition to PIB status, could be used to predict future risk for AD among subjects with mild cognitive impairment (n = 59). SETTING: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative public database. PARTICIPANTS: The study involved data from 21 normal control subjects, 59 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and 20 participants with clinically defined AD from the Alzheimer Disease's Neuroimaging Initiative database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical AD diagnosis and WMH volume. RESULTS: Pittsburgh Compound B positivity and increased total WMH volume independently predicted AD diagnosis. Among PIB-positive subjects, those diagnosed as having AD had greater WMH volume than normal control subjects. Among subjects with mild cognitive impairment, both WMH and PIB status at baseline conferred risk for future diagnosis of AD. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: White matter hyperintensities contribute to the presentation of AD and, in the context of significant amyloid deposition, may provide a second hit necessary for the clinical manifestation of the disease. As risk factors for the development of WMHs are modifiable, these findings suggest intervention and prevention strategies for the clinical syndrome of AD.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Alzheimer Disease/*complications/*diagnosis/*metabolism/radionuclide imaging Amyloidosis/*etiology Aniline Compounds/diagnostic use Brain Mapping Cerebral Cortex/*pathology/radionuclide imaging Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data Female Humans Longitudinal Studies Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Mild Cognitive Impairment/pathology/radionuclide imaging Nerve Fibers, Myelinated/*pathology Positron-Emission Tomography Thiazoles/diagnostic use"

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of sex with short-term risk of THA revision after adjusting for patient, implant, surgery, surgeon, and hospital confounders. DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective cohort of patients enrolled in a total joint replacement registry from April 1, 2001, through December 31, 2010. PARTICIPANTS: Patients undergoing primary, elective, unilateral THA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Failure of THA, defined as revision procedure for (1) any reason, (2) septic reason, or (3) aseptic reason after the index procedure. RESULTS: A total of 35,140 THAs with 3.0 years of median follow-up were identified. Women constituted 57.5% of the study sample, and the mean (SD) patient age was 65.7 (11.6) years. A higher proportion of women received 28-mm femoral heads (28.2% vs 13.1%) and had metal on highly cross-linked polyethylene-bearing surfaces (60.6% vs 53.7%) than men. Men had a higher proportion of 36-mm or larger heads (55.4% vs 32.8%) and metal on metal-bearing surfaces (19.4% vs 9.6%). At 5-year follow-up, implant survival was 97.4% (95% CI, 97.2%-97.6%). Device survival for men (97.7%; 95% CI, 97.4%-98.0%) vs women (97.1%; 95% CI, 96.8%-97.4%) was significantly different (P = .01). After adjustments, the hazards ratios for women were 1.29 (95% CI, 1.11-1.51) for all-cause revision, 1.32 (95% CI, 1.10-1.58) for aseptic revision, and 1.17 (95% CI, 0.81-1.68) for septic revision. CONCLUSIONS: After considering patient-, surgery-, surgeon-, volume-, and implant-specific risk factors, women had a 29% higher risk of implant failure than men after THA in this community-based sample.","Aged *Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip/adverse effects/instrumentation Cohort Studies Equipment Failure Analysis Female Humans Male Middle Aged *Prosthesis Design/methods/statistics & numerical data Prosthesis Failure/*etiology Registries Reoperation/*statistics & numerical data Risk Assessment Risk Factors Sex Distribution Sex Factors Surgical Procedures, Elective/adverse effects/methods/statistics & numerical data Treatment Outcome United States"

The United States documented the elimination of endemic measles in 2000 and of endemic rubella and CRS in 2004. In December 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened an external expert panel to review the evidence and determine whether elimination of endemic measles, rubella, and CRS had been sustained. OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence for sustained elimination of endemic measles, rubella, and CRS from the United States through 2011. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Review of data for measles from 2001 to 2011 and for rubella and CRS from 2004 to 2011 covering the US resident population and international visitors, including disease epidemiology, importation status of cases, molecular epidemiology, adequacy of surveillance, and population immunity as estimated by national vaccination coverage and serologic surveys. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Annual numbers of measles, rubella, and CRS cases, by importation status, outbreak size, and distribution; proportions of US population seropositive for measles and rubella; and measles-mumps-rubella vaccination coverage levels. RESULTS: Since 2001, US reported measles incidence has remained below 1 case per 1,000,000 population. Since 2004, rubella incidence has been below 1 case per 10,000,000 population, and CRS incidence has been below 1 case per 5,000,000 births. Eighty-eight percent of measles cases and 54% of rubella cases were internationally imported or epidemiologically or virologically linked to importation. The few cases not linked to importation were insufficient to represent endemic transmission. Molecular epidemiology indicated no endemic genotypes. The US surveillance system is adequate to detect endemic measles or rubella. Seroprevalence and vaccination coverage data indicate high levels of population immunity to measles and rubella. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The external expert panel concluded that the elimination of endemic measles, rubella, and CRS from the United States was sustained through 2011. However, international importation continues, and health care providers should suspect measles or rubella in patients with febrile rash illness, especially when associated with international travel or international visitors, and should report suspected cases to the local health department.","Endemic Diseases/prevention & control/*statistics & numerical data Epidemiological Monitoring History, 21st Century Humans Mass Vaccination/statistics & numerical data Measles/*epidemiology/prevention & control Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine Rubella/*epidemiology/prevention & control Rubella Syndrome, Congenital/epidemiology/prevention & control United States/epidemiology"
23552572,High variation between hospitals in vena cava filter use for venous thromboembolism.,JAMA Intern Med,White RH and Geraghty EM and Brunson A and Murin S and Wun T and Spencer F and Romano PS,ucdavis,"BACKGROUND: The extent to which vena cava filter (VCF) use varies between hospitals in the management of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) is not clear. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study that compared the frequency of VCF use among California hospitals from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2010. Using administrative hospital discharge data, we followed explicit criteria to identify nontrauma patients with acute VTE, and determined the frequency of VCF placement in each of the hospitals that admitted more than 55 VTE patients. Multivariable hierarchical regression models to predict VCF use included important clinical and demographic variables as fixed effects and hospital as a random effect. RESULTS: Among the 263 hospitals included, 130 643 acute VTE hospitalizations occurred with the placement of 19 537 VCFs (14.95%). Variation in the percentage of acute VTE hospitalizations that included VCF placement was very high, from 0% to 38.96% (interquartile range, 6.23%-18.14%), with 18.49% of the observed variation due to differences among the hospitals that provided care. Significant clinical predictors of VCF use included acute bleeding at the time of admission (odds ratio, 3.4 [95% CI, 3.2-3.6]), a major operation after admission for VTE (3.4 [3.3-3.5]), presence of metastatic cancer (1.7 [1.6-1.8]), and extreme severity of illness (2.5 [2.3-2.7] vs mild). Insertion of VCFs occurred more frequently than expected in 109 hospitals and less frequently in 59. Hospital characteristics associated with VCF use included a small number of beds (odds ratio, 0.2 [95% CI, 0.2-0.4], <100 vs >400 beds), a rural location (0.4 [0.2-0.5]), and other private vs Kaiser hospitals (1.5 [1.1-2.0]). Use of VCFs varied widely even in geographically proximate areas. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of VCF use in patients with acute VTE varied widely and depended on which hospital provided the care, even after adjusting for clinical and socioeconomic factors. Further research is needed to determine whether this variation is associated with local cultural differences between hospitals or with differences in the availability of interventional radiologists or specialists, or whether it reflects the absence of high-quality evidence that VCFs are effective.",California Hospital Records *Hospitals Humans Retrospective Studies Vena Cava Filters/*utilization Venous Thromboembolism/*therapy

OBJECTIVES: To provide updated estimates of and trends for childhood exposure to a broad range of violence, crime, and abuse victimizations. DESIGN: The National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence was based on a cross-sectional, US national telephone survey conducted in 2011. SETTING: Interviews by telephone. PARTICIPANTS: The experiences of 4503 children and youth aged 1 month to 17 years were assessed by interviews with caregivers and with youth in the case of those aged 10 to 17 years. RESULTS: Two-fifths (41.2%) of children and youth experienced a physical assault in the last year, and 1 in 10 (10.1%) experienced an assault-related injury. Two percent experienced sexual assault or sexual abuse in the last year, but the rate was 10.7% for girls aged 14 to 17 years. More than 1 in 10 (13.7%) experienced maltreatment by a caregiver, including 3.7% who experienced physical abuse. Few significant changes could be detected in rates since an equivalent survey in 2008, but declines were documented in peer flashing, school bomb threats, juvenile sibling assault, and robbery and total property victimization. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The variety and scope of children's exposure to violence, crime, and abuse suggest the need for better and more comprehensive tools in clinical and research settings for identifying these experiences and their effects.","Adolescent Bullying Caregivers/psychology Child Child Abuse/statistics & numerical data Child, Preschool Crime/*statistics & numerical data Cross-Sectional Studies Female Humans Incidence Infant Male Peer Group Prevalence Risk Factors United States/epidemiology Violence/*statistics & numerical data"

OBJECTIVE: To determine if supplementing diet with long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids or with macular xanthophylls results in a reduced rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Cardiovascular Outcome Study (COS) was an ancillary study of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2), a factorial-designed randomized clinical trial of 4203 participants recruited from 82 US academic and community ophthalmology clinics, who were followed up for a median of 4.8 years. Individuals were eligible to participate if they were between the ages of 50 and 85 years, had intermediate or advanced age-related macular degeneration in 1 eye, and were willing to be randomized. Participants with stable, existing CVD (>12 months since initial event) were eligible to participate. Participants, staff, and outcome assessors were masked to intervention. INTERVENTIONS: Daily supplementation with long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (350-mg docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] + 650-mg eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]), macular xanthophylls (10-mg lutein + 2-mg zeaxanthin), combination of the two, or matching placebos. These treatments were added to background therapy of the AREDS vitamin and mineral formulation for macular degeneration. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death with 4 prespecified secondary combinations of the primary outcome with hospitalized heart failure, revascularization, or unstable angina. RESULTS: Study participants were primarily white, married, and highly educated, with a median age at baseline of 74 years. A total of 602 cardiovascular events were adjudicated, and 459 were found to meet 1 of the study definitions for a CVD outcome. In intention-to-treat analysis, no reduction in the risk of CVD or secondary CVD outcomes was seen for the DHA + EPA (primary outcome: hazard ratio [HR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.78-1.17) or lutein + zeaxanthin (primary outcome: HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.77-1.15) groups. No differences in adverse events or serious adverse event were seen by treatment group. The sample size was sufficient to detect a 25% reduction in CVD events with 80% power. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Dietary supplementation of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids or macular xanthophylls in addition to daily intake of minerals and vitamins did not reduce the risk of CVD in elderly participants with age-related macular degeneration.

25144163,Survival outcomes in advanced laryngeal cancer.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Megwalu UC and Sikora AG,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Chemoradiation therapy has become increasingly popular in the treatment of advanced laryngeal cancer as part of an organ preservation protocol. However, several studies have reported a decline in survival, possibly attributable to the increased use of radiation and chemoradiation therapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate survival outcomes of laryngeal conservation vs surgical therapy in the treatment of advanced laryngeal cancer in the United States using a large population-based cancer database. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based, nonconcurrent cohort study of 5394 patients who received a diagnosis of stage III or IV laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma between 1992 and 2009. Data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 Database. INTERVENTIONS: Surgical or nonsurgical therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). RESULTS: Patients who received surgical therapy had better 2-year and 5-year DSS (70% vs 64% and 55% vs 51%, respectively; P < .001) and 2-year and 5-year OS (64% vs 57% and 44% vs 39%, respectively; P < .001) than patients who received nonsurgical therapy. The difference in DSS and OS between treatment groups remained after stratification by year-of-diagnosis cohorts (P < .001). The survival gap consistently narrowed with subsequent year-of-diagnosis cohorts. On multivariable analysis, nonsurgical patients had worse DSS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.33 [95% CI, 1.21-1.45]) and OS (HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.22-1.43]) after adjustment for year of diagnosis, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, age, sex, subsite, race, and marital status. Stage III disease (HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.54-0.65]), glottic subsite (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.67-0.82]), 2004 to 2009 year-of-diagnosis cohort (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.70-0.90]), female sex (HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.72-0.89]), and married status (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.62-0.75]) positively affected DSS. Black race (HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.05-1.30]) and increased age (HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.02-1.03] for each year) negatively affected DSS. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Surgical therapy leads to better survival outcomes than nonsurgical therapy for patients with advanced laryngeal cancer. Patients need to be made aware of the modest but significant survival disadvantage associated with nonsurgical therapy as part of the shared decision-making process during treatment selection.",Missing
23677406,Surgical residents' perceptions of 2011 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education duty hour regulations.,JAMA Surg,Drolet BC and Sangisetty S and Tracy TF and Cioffi WG,lifespan,"IMPORTANCE: In 2010, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) proposed increased regulation of work hours and supervision for residents. New Common Program requirements that took effect in July 2011 dramatically changed the customary 24-hour in-house call schedule. Surgical residents are more likely to be affected by these duty hour restrictions. OBJECTIVE: To examine surgical residents' views of the 2011 ACGME Common Program requirements after implementation in July 2011. DESIGN: A 20-question electronic survey was administered 6 months after implementation of 2011 ACGME regulations to 123 participating institutions. SETTING: ACGME-accredited teaching hospitals in the United States and US territories. PARTICIPANTS: The total sample was 1013 voluntarily participating residents in general surgery and surgical specialties at ACGME-accredited institutions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Residents' perceptions of changes in education, patient care, and quality of life after institution of 2011 ACGME duty hour regulations and their compliance with these rules. RESULTS: A subset of 1013 residents training in general surgery or a surgical subspecialty was identified from a demographically representative sample of 6202 survey respondents. Most surgical residents indicated that education (55.1%), preparation for senior roles (68.4%), and work schedules (50.7%) are worse after implementation of the 2011 regulations. They reported no change in supervision (80.8%), safety of patient care (53.4%), or amount of rest (57.8%). Although quality of life is perceived as better for interns (61.9%), most residents believe that it is worse for senior residents (54.4%). A majority report increased handoffs (78.2%) and a shift of junior-level responsibilities to senior residents (68.7%). Finally, many residents report noncompliance (67.6%) and duty hour falsification (62.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A majority of surgical residents disapprove of 2011 ACGME Common Program requirements (65.9%). The proposed benefits of the increased duty hour restrictions-improved education, patient care, and quality of life-have ostensibly not borne out in surgical training. It may be difficult for residents, particularly in surgical fields, to learn and care for patients under the 2011 ACGME regulations.","*Accreditation Adult *Attitude of Health Personnel *Education, Medical, Graduate Female General Surgery/*education Humans Internship and Residency Male Personnel Staffing and Scheduling *Students, Medical United States Work Schedule Tolerance Workload"
24848779,Costs Associated With Surgical Site Infections in Veterans Affairs Hospitals.,JAMA Surg,Schweizer ML and Cullen JJ and Perencevich EN and Vaughan Sarrazin MS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE Surgical site infections (SSIs) are potentially preventable complications that are associated with excess morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE To determine the excess costs associated with total, deep, and superficial SSIs among all operations and for high-volume surgical specialties. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Surgical patients from 129 Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals were included. The Veterans Health Administration Decision Support System and VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program databases were used to assess costs associated with SSIs among VA patients who underwent surgery in fiscal year 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate incremental costs associated with SSIs, controlling for patient risk factors, surgical risk factors, and hospital-level variation in costs. Costs of the index hospitalization and subsequent 30-day readmissions were included. Additional analysis determined potential cost savings of quality improvement programs to reduce SSI rates at hospitals with the highest risk-adjusted SSI rates. RESULTS Among 54 233 VA patients who underwent surgery, 1756 (3.2%) experienced an SSI. Overall, 0.8% of the cohort had a deep SSI, and 2.4% had a superficial SSI. The mean unadjusted costs were $31 580 and $52 620 for patients without and with an SSI, respectively. In the risk-adjusted analyses, the relative costs were 1.43 times greater for patients with an SSI than for patients without an SSI (95% CI, 1.34-1.52; difference, $11 876). Deep SSIs were associated with 1.93 times greater costs (95% CI, 1.71-2.18; difference, $25 721), and superficial SSIs were associated with 1.25 times greater costs (95% CI, 1.17-1.35; difference, $7003). Among the highest-volume specialties, the greatest mean cost attributable to SSIs was $23 755 among patients undergoing neurosurgery, followed by patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, general surgery, peripheral vascular surgery, and urologic surgery. If hospitals in the highest 10th percentile (ie, the worst hospitals) reduced their SSI rates to the rates of the hospitals in the 50th percentile, the Veterans Health Administration would save approximately $6.7 million per year. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Surgical site infections are associated with significant excess costs.

OBJECTIVE: To assess physicians' attitudes toward and perceived role in addressing health care costs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional survey mailed in 2012 to 3897 US physicians randomly selected from the AMA Masterfile. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Enthusiasm for 17 cost-containment strategies and agreement with an 11-measure cost-consciousness scale. RESULTS: A total of 2556 physicians responded (response rate = 65%). Most believed that trial lawyers (60%), health insurance companies (59%), hospitals and health systems (56%), pharmaceutical and device manufacturers (56%), and patients (52%) have a ""major responsibility"" for reducing health care costs, whereas only 36% reported that practicing physicians have ""major responsibility."" Most were ""very enthusiastic"" for ""promoting continuity of care"" (75%), ""expanding access to quality and safety data"" (51%), and ""limiting access to expensive treatments with little net benefit"" (51%) as a means of reducing health care costs. Few expressed enthusiasm for ""eliminating fee-for-service payment models"" (7%). Most physicians reported being ""aware of the costs of the tests/treatments [they] recommend"" (76%), agreed they should adhere to clinical guidelines that discourage the use of marginally beneficial care (79%), and agreed that they ""should be solely devoted to individual patients' best interests, even if that is expensive"" (78%) and that ""doctors need to take a more prominent role in limiting use of unnecessary tests"" (89%). Most (85%) disagreed that they ""should sometimes deny beneficial but costly services to certain patients because resources should go to other patients that need them more."" In multivariable logistic regression models testing associations with enthusiasm for key cost-containment strategies, having a salary plus bonus or salary-only compensation type was independently associated with enthusiasm for ""eliminating fee for service"" (salary plus bonus: odds ratio [OR], 3.3, 99% CI, 1.8-6.1; salary only: OR, 4.3, 99% CI, 2.2-8.5). In multivariable linear regression models, group or government practice setting (beta = 0.87, 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.45, P = .004; and beta = 0.99, 95% CI, 0.20 to 1.79, P = .01, respectively) and having a salary plus bonus compensation type (beta = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.33; P = .002) were positively associated with cost-consciousness. Finding the ""uncertainty involved in patient care disconcerting"" was negatively associated with cost-consciousness (beta = -1.95; 95% CI, -2.71 to -1.18; P < .001). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this survey about health care cost containment, US physicians reported having some responsibility to address health care costs in their practice and expressed general agreement about several quality initiatives to reduce cost but reported less enthusiasm for cost containment involving changes in payment models.",Adult *Attitude *Cost Control Cross-Sectional Studies Data Collection Female *Health Care Costs Humans Male Middle Aged *Physician's Role Physicians/psychology Reimbursement Mechanisms United States

Data on undertreatment, treatment use, and treatment satisfaction are paramount to identify priority areas for advocacy, education, and research to improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent of nontreatment and undertreatment of psoriatic diseases, trends in treatment use, treatment satisfaction, and reasons for medication discontinuation among patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used the national survey data collected by the National Psoriasis Foundation via biannual surveys conducted from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2011, in the United States. Survey data were collected from randomly sampled patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the US population from a database of more than 76,000 patients with psoriatic diseases. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Nontreatment, undertreatment, and treatment trends determined by the use of prescription medication (topical, phototherapeutic, oral systemic, and biologic), as well as treatment satisfaction and reasons for medication discontinuation. RESULTS: A total of 5604 patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis completed the survey. From 2003 through 2011, patients who were untreated ranged from 36.6% to 49.2% of patients with mild psoriasis, 23.6% to 35.5% of patients with moderate psoriasis, and 9.4% to 29.7% of patients with severe psoriasis. Among those receiving treatment, 29.5% of patients with moderate psoriasis and 21.5% of patients with severe psoriasis were treated with topical agents alone. The most frequently used phototherapy modality is UV-B, whereas methotrexate is the most commonly used oral agent. Although adverse effects and a lack of effectiveness were primary reasons for discontinuing biological agents, the inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage was among the top reasons for discontinuation. Overall, 52.3% of patients with psoriasis and 45.5% of patients with psoriatic arthritis were dissatisfied with their treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Nontreatment and undertreatment of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis remain a significant problem in the United States. While various treatment modalities are available for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, widespread treatment dissatisfaction exists. Efforts in advocacy and education are necessary to ensure that effective treatments are accessible to this patient population.","Adult Aged Arthritis, Psoriatic/pathology/*therapy Data Collection Dermatologic Agents/*therapeutic use Female Humans Insurance Coverage/statistics & numerical data Male Methotrexate/therapeutic use Middle Aged Patient Satisfaction/*statistics & numerical data Phototherapy/*methods Physician's Practice Patterns/statistics & numerical data Psoriasis/pathology/*therapy Severity of Illness Index Treatment Outcome United States"

OBJECTIVE: To identify trends in children's exposure to violence, crime, and abuse from 2003 through 2011. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Three national telephone surveys of representative samples of children and caregivers from 2003, 2008, and 2011 were compared, all obtained using the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire; samples included parents of children 2 to 9 years old and youth 10 to 17 years old. EXPOSURES: Direct and indirect experiences of violence, abuse, and victimization during the previous year. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in rates between 2003 and 2011 and between 2008 and 2011. RESULTS: Of 50 trends in exposure examined, there were 27 significant declines and no significant increases between 2003 and 2011. Declines were particularly large for assault victimization, bullying, and sexual victimization. There were also significant declines in the perpetration of violence and property crime. For the recession period between 2008 and 2011, there were 11 significant declines and no increases for 50 specific trends examined. Dating violence declined, as did one form of sexual victimization and some forms of indirect exposure.

Similar information among older patients is lacking because existing trauma databases do not include important patient comorbidity information. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether racial disparities in trauma survival persist in patients 65 years or older. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Trauma patients were identified from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (January 1, 2003, through December 30, 2010) using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. Injury severity was ascertained by applying the Trauma Mortality Prediction Model, and patient comorbidities were quantified using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital mortality after trauma for blacks vs whites for younger (16-64 years of age) and older (>/=65 years of age) patients was compared using 3 different statistical methods: univariable logistic regression, multivariable logistic regression with and without clustering for hospital effects, and coarsened exact matching. Model covariates included age, sex, insurance status, type and intent of injury, injury severity, head injury severity, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: A total of 1,073,195 patients were included (502,167 patients 16-64 years of age and 571,028 patients >/=65 years of age). Most older patients were white (547,325 [95.8%]), female (406 158 [71.1%]), and insured (567,361 [99.4%]) and had Charlson Comorbidity Index scores of 1 or higher (323,741 [56.7%]). The unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) for death in blacks vs whites were 1.35 (95% CI, 1.28-1.42) for patients 16 to 64 years of age and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.93-1.08) for patients 65 years or older. After risk adjustment, racial disparities in survival persisted in the younger black group (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.13-1.30) but were reversed in the older group (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76-0.90). This finding was consistent across all 3 statistical methods. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Different racial disparities in survival after trauma exist between white and black patients depending on their age group. Although younger white patients have better outcomes after trauma than younger black patients, older black patients have better outcomes than older white patients.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between sustained virological response (SVR) and all-cause mortality in patients with chronic HCV infection and advanced hepatic fibrosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: An international, multicenter, long-term follow-up study from 5 large tertiary care hospitals in Europe and Canada of 530 patients with chronic HCV infection who started an interferon-based treatment regimen between 1990 and 2003, following histological proof of advanced hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis (Ishak score 4-6). Complete follow-up ranged between January 2010 and October 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were liver failure, HCC, and liver-related mortality or liver transplantation. RESULTS: The 530 study patients were followed up for a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 8.4 (6.4-11.4) years. The baseline median (IQR) age was 48 (42-56) years and 369 patients (70%) were men. The Ishak fibrosis score was 4 in 143 patients (27%), 5 in 101 patients (19%), and 6 in 286 patients (54%). There were 192 patients (36%) who achieved SVR; 13 patients with SVR and 100 without SVR died (10-year cumulative all-cause mortality rate, 8.9% [95% CI, 3.3%-14.5%] with SVR and 26.0% [95% CI, 20.2%-28.4%] without SVR; P < .001). In time-dependent multivariate Cox regression analysis, SVR was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14-0.49; P < .001) and reduced risk of liver-related mortality or transplantation (HR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.02-0.19; P < .001), the latter occurring in 3 patients with SVR and 103 without SVR. The 10-year cumulative incidence rate of liver-related mortality or transplantation was 1.9% (95% CI, 0.0%-4.1%) with SVR and 27.4% (95% CI, 22.0%-32.8%) without SVR (P < .001). There were 7 patients with SVR and 76 without SVR who developed HCC (10-year cumulative incidence rate, 5.1%; 95% CI, 1.3%-8.9%; vs 21.8%; 95% CI, 16.6%-27.0%; P < .001), and 4 patients with SVR and 111 without SVR experienced liver failure (10-year cumulative incidence rate, 2.1%; 95% CI, 0.0%-4.5%; vs 29.9%; 95% CI, 24.3%-35.5%; P < .001).

23863861,Comorbidities and mortality in bipolar disorder: a Swedish national cohort study.,JAMA Psychiatry,Crump C and Sundquist K and Winkleby MA and Sundquist J,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Bipolar disorder is associated with premature mortality, but the specific causes and underlying pathways are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To examine the physical health effects of bipolar disorder using outpatient and inpatient data for a national population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: National cohort study of 6,587,036 Swedish adults, including 6618 with bipolar disorder. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Physical comorbidities diagnosed in any outpatient or inpatient setting nationwide and mortality (January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2009). RESULTS: Women and men with bipolar disorder died 9.0 and 8.5 years earlier on average than the rest of the population, respectively. All-cause mortality was increased 2-fold among women (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.34; 95% CI, 2.16-2.53) and men (aHR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.85-2.23) with bipolar disorder, compared with the rest of the population. Patients with bipolar disorder had increased mortality from cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), influenza or pneumonia, unintentional injuries, and suicide for both women and men and cancer for women only. Suicide risk was 10-fold among women (aHR, 10.37; 95% CI, 7.36-14.60) and 8-fold among men (aHR, 8.09; 95% CI, 5.98-10.95) with bipolar disorder, compared with the rest of the population. Substance use disorders contributed only modestly to these findings. The association between bipolar disorder and mortality from chronic diseases (ischemic heart disease, diabetes, COPD, or cancer) was weaker among persons with a prior diagnosis of these conditions (aHR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.26-1.56) than among those without a prior diagnosis (aHR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.95-2.90; P(interaction) = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this large national cohort study, patients with bipolar disorder died prematurely from multiple causes, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD, influenza or pneumonia, unintentional injuries, and suicide. However, chronic disease mortality among those with more timely medical diagnosis approached that of the general population, suggesting that better provision of primary medical care may effectively reduce premature mortality among persons with bipolar disorder.","Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*mortality Cohort Studies Comorbidity Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mortality, Premature Registries Sweden/epidemiology Young Adult"
23568703,Electronic media-based health interventions promoting behavior change in youth: a systematic review.,JAMA Pediatr,Hieftje K and Edelman EJ and Camenga DR and Fiellin LE,yale,"IMPORTANCE: Little research has been done on the efficacy of electronic media-based interventions, especially on their effect on health or safety behavior. The current review systematically identified and evaluated electronic media-based interventions that focused on promoting health and safety behavior change in youth. OBJECTIVE: To assess the type and quality of the studies evaluating the effects of electronic media-based interventions on health and safety behavior change. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Studies were identified from searches in MEDLINE (1950 through September 2010) and PsycINFO (1967 through September 2010). The review included published studies of interventions that used electronic media and focused on changes in behavior related to health or safety in children aged 18 years or younger. FINDINGS: Nineteen studies met the criteria and focused on at least 1 behavior change outcome. The focus was interventions related to physical activity and/or nutrition in 7 studies, on asthma in 6, safety behaviors in 3, sexual risk behaviors in 2, and diabetes mellitus in 1. Seventeen studies reported at least 1 statistically significant effect on behavior change outcomes, including an increase in fruit, juice, or vegetable consumption; an increase in physical activity; improved asthma self-management; acquisition of street and fire safety skills; and sexual abstinence. Only 5 of the 19 studies were rated as excellent. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our systematic review suggests that interventions using electronic media can improve health and safety behaviors in young persons, but there is a need for higher-quality, rigorous interventions that promote behavior change.","Adolescent Adolescent Behavior Child Child Behavior Child, Preschool *Health Behavior Health Education/methods Health Promotion/*methods Humans *Internet Multimedia *Risk Reduction Behavior *Safety Video Games/*psychology *Video Recording"
25027139,Telecare collaborative management of chronic pain in primary care: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Kroenke K and Krebs EE and Wu J and Yu Z and Chumbler NR and Bair MJ,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is among the most prevalent, costly, and disabling medical disorders. However, few clinical trials have examined interventions to improve chronic pain in primary care. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a telecare intervention for chronic pain. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Stepped Care to Optimize Pain Care Effectiveness (SCOPE) study was a randomized trial comparing a telephone-delivered collaborative care management intervention vs usual care in 250 patients with chronic (>/=3 months) musculoskeletal pain of at least moderate intensity (Brief Pain Inventory [BPI] score >/=5). Patients were enrolled from 5 primary care clinics in a single Veterans Affairs medical center from June 2010 through May 2012, with 12-month follow-up completed by June 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized either to an intervention group (n = 124) or to a usual care group whose members received all pain care as usual from their primary care physicians (n = 126). The intervention group received 12 months of telecare management that coupled automated symptom monitoring with an algorithm-guided stepped care approach to optimizing analgesics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was the BPI total score, which ranges from 0 (""no pain"") to 10 (""pain as bad as you can imagine"") and for which a 1-point change is considered clinically important. Secondary pain outcomes included BPI interference and severity, global pain improvement, treatment satisfaction, and use of opioids and other analgesics. RESULTS: Overall, mean (SD) baseline BPI scores in the intervention and control groups were 5.31 (1.81) and 5.12 (1.80), respectively. Compared with usual care, the intervention group had a 1.02-point lower (95% CI, -1.58 to -0.47) BPI score at 12 months (3.57 vs 4.59). Patients in the intervention group were nearly twice as likely to report at least a 30% improvement in their pain score by 12 months (51.7% vs 27.1%; relative risk, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.4 to 2.7]), with a number needed to treat of 4.1 (95% CI, 3.0 to 6.4) for a 30% improvement. Secondary pain outcomes also improved. Few patients in either group required opioid initiation or dose escalation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Telecare collaborative management increased the proportion of primary care patients with improved chronic musculoskeletal pain. This was accomplished by optimizing nonopioid analgesic medications using a stepped care algorithm and monitoring.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether an allied health professional telephone visit could safely substitute for an in-person clinic visit. DESIGN: Prospective case series during a 10-month study period from October 2011 to October 2012 (excluding July and August 2012). SETTING: University-affiliated veterans hospital. PATIENTS: Ambulatory surgery patients who underwent elective open hernia repair or laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the 10-month study period. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were called 2 weeks after surgery by a physician assistant and assessed using a scripted template. Assessment variables included overall health, pain, fever, incision appearance, activity level, and any patient concerns. If the telephone assessment was consistent with absence of infection and return to baseline activities, the patient was discharged from follow-up. Patients who preferred a clinic visit were seen accordingly. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Percentage of patients who accepted telehealth follow-up and complications that presented in telehealth patients within 30 days of surgery. RESULTS: One hundred fifteen open herniorrhaphy and 26 laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients had attempted telehealth follow-up. Seventy-eight percent (110) of all patients were successfully contacted; of those, 70.8% (63) of hernia patients and 90.5% (19) of cholecystectomy patients accepted telehealth as the sole means of follow-up. Complications in the telehealth patients were zero for cholecystectomy and 4.8% (3) for herniorrhaphy. Nearly all patients expressed great satisfaction with the telephone follow-up method. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth can be safely used in selected ambulatory patients as a substitute for the standard postoperative clinic visit with a high degree of patient satisfaction. Time and expense for travel (7-866 miles) were reduced and the freed clinic time was used to schedule new patients.","*Ambulatory Surgical Procedures California/epidemiology *Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic *Continuity of Patient Care Female *Herniorrhaphy Humans Male *Physician Assistants Pilot Projects Postoperative Complications/epidemiology Prospective Studies *Telephone Travel Treatment Outcome"

Providing specialty care to patients via telemedicine could help alleviate this growing problem. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and economic benefits of using web-based videoconferencing (telemedicine) to provide specialty care to patients with Parkinson disease in their homes. DESIGN: A 7-month, 2-center, randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Patients' homes and outpatient clinics at 2 academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty patients with Parkinson disease with Internet access at home. INTERVENTION: Care from a specialist delivered remotely at home or in person in the clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome variable was feasibility, as measured by the percentage of telemedicine visits completed as scheduled. Secondary outcome measures included clinical benefit, as measured by the 39-item Parkinson Disease Questionnaire, and economic value, as measured by time and travel. RESULTS: Twenty participants enrolled in the study and were randomly assigned to telemedicine (n = 9) or in-person care (n = 11). Of the 27 scheduled telemedicine visits, 25 (93%) were completed, and of the 33 scheduled in-person visits, 30 (91%) were completed (P = .99). In this small study, the change in quality of life did not differ for those randomly assigned to telemedicine compared with those randomly assigned to in-person care (4.0-point improvement vs 6.4-point improvement; P = .61). Compared with in-person visits, each telemedicine visit saved participants, on average, 100 miles of travel and 3 hours of time. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Using web-based videoconferencing to provide specialty care at home is feasible, provides value to patients, and may offer similar clinical benefit to that of in-person care. Larger studies are needed to determine whether the clinical benefits are indeed comparable to those of in-person care and whether the results observed are generalizable.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of combining cognitive therapy (CT) with ADM vs ADM alone on remission and recovery in major depressive disorder (MDD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 452 adult outpatients with chronic or recurrent MDD participated in a trial conducted in research clinics at 3 university medical centers in the United States. The patients were randomly assigned to ADM treatment alone or CT combined with ADM treatment. Treatment was continued for up to 42 months until recovery was achieved. INTERVENTIONS: Antidepressant medication with or without CT. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Blind evaluations of recovery with a modified version of the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation. RESULTS: Combined treatment enhanced the rate of recovery vs treatment with ADM alone (72.6% vs 62.5%; t451 = 2.45; P = .01; hazard ratio [HR], 1.33; 95% CI, 1.06-1.68; number needed to treat [NNT], 10; 95% CI, 5-72). This effect was conditioned on interactions with severity (t451 = 1.97; P = .05; NNT, 5) and chronicity (chi2 = 7.46; P = .02; NNT, 6) such that the advantage for combined treatment was limited to patients with severe, nonchronic MDD (81.3% vs 51.7%; n = 146; t145 = 3.96; P = .001; HR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.54-3.57; NNT, 3; 95% CI, 2-5). Fewer patients dropped out of combined treatment vs ADM treatment alone (18.9% vs 26.8%; t451 = -2.04; P = .04; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.98). Remission rates did not differ significantly either as a main effect of treatment or as an interaction with severity or chronicity. Patients with comorbid Axis II disorders took longer to recover than did patients without comorbid Axis II disorders regardless of the condition (P = .01). Patients who received combined treatment reported fewer serious adverse events than did patients who received ADMs alone (49 vs 71; P = .02), largely because they experienced less time in an MDD episode. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cognitive therapy combined with ADM treatment enhances the rates of recovery from MDD relative to ADMs alone, with the effect limited to patients with severe, nonchronic depression.

Frequency of church attendance was not significantly related to depression risk. Our previous brain imaging findings in adult offspring in these high-risk families also revealed large expanses of cortical thinning across the lateral surface of the right cerebral hemisphere. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether high-risk adults who reported high importance of religion or spirituality had thicker cortices than those who reported moderate or low importance of religion or spirituality and whether this effect varied by family risk status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal, retrospective cohort, familial study of 103 adults (aged 18-54 years) who were the second- or third-generation offspring of depressed (high familial risk) or nondepressed (low familiar risk) probands (first generation). Religious or spiritual importance and church attendance were assessed at 2 time points during 5 years, and cortical thickness was measured on anatomical images of the brain acquired with magnetic resonance imaging at the second time point. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cortical thickness in the parietal regions by risk status. RESULTS: Importance of religion or spirituality, but not frequency of attendance, was associated with thicker cortices in the left and right parietal and occipital regions, the mesial frontal lobe of the right hemisphere, and the cuneus and precuneus in the left hemisphere, independent of familial risk. In addition, the effects of importance on cortical thickness were significantly stronger in the high-risk than in the low-risk group, particularly along the mesial wall of the left hemisphere, in the same region where we previously reported a significant thinner cortex associated with a familial risk of developing depressive illness. We note that these findings are correlational and therefore do not prove a causal association between importance and cortical thickness. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A thicker cortex associated with a high importance of religion or spirituality may confer resilience to the development of depressive illness in individuals at high familial risk for major depression, possibly by expanding a cortical reserve that counters to some extent the vulnerability that cortical thinning poses for developing familial depressive illness.","Adolescent Adult Cerebral Cortex/anatomy & histology/*pathology Child of Impaired Parents Depressive Disorder, Major/*pathology/psychology Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Longitudinal Studies Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Pedigree *Religion Retrospective Studies Risk *Spirituality Young Adult"

23101118,Neurocognitive development of children 4 years after critical illness and treatment with tight glucose control: a randomized controlled trial.,JAMA,Mesotten D and Gielen M and Sterken C and Claessens K and Hermans G and Vlasselaers D and Lemiere J and Lagae L and Gewillig M and Eyskens B and Vanhorebeek I and Wouters PJ and Van den Berghe G,Missing,"CONTEXT: A large randomized controlled trial revealed that tight glucose control (TGC) to age-adjusted normoglycemia (50-80 mg/dL at age <1 year and 70-100 mg/dL at age 1-16 years) reduced intensive care morbidity and mortality compared with usual care (UC), but increased hypoglycemia (</=40 mg/dL) (25% vs 1%). OBJECTIVE: As both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia may adversely affect the developing brain, long-term follow-up was required to exclude harm and validate short-term benefits of TGC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A prospective, randomized controlled trial of 700 patients aged 16 years or younger who were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Hospitals in Leuven, Belgium, between October 2004 and December 2007. Follow-up was scheduled after 3 years with infants assessed at 4 years old between August 2008 and January 2012. Assessment was performed blinded for treatment allocation, in-hospital (83%) or at home/school (17%). For comparison, 216 healthy siblings and unrelated children were tested. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intelligence (full-scale intelligence quotient [IQ]), as assessed with age-adjusted tests (Wechsler IQ scales). Further neurodevelopmental testing encompassed tests for visual-motor integration (Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration); attention, motor coordination, and executive functions (Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks); memory (Children's Memory Scale); and behavior (Child Behavior Checklist). RESULTS: Sixteen percent of patients declined participation or could not be reached (n = 113), resulting in 569 patients being alive and testable at follow-up. At a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 3.9 (3.8-4.1) years after randomization, TGC in the ICU did not affect full-scale IQ score (median [IQR], 88.0 [74.0-100.0] vs 88.5 [74.3-99.0] for UC; P = .73) and had not increased incidence of poor outcomes (death or severe disability precluding neurocognitive testing: 19% [68/349] vs 18% [63/351] with UC; risk-adjusted odds ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.60-1.46; P = .72). Other scores for intelligence, visual-motor integration, and memory also did not differ between groups. Tight glucose control improved motor coordination (9% [95% CI, 0%-18%] to 20% [95% CI, 5%-35%] better, all P </= .03) and cognitive flexibility (19% [95% CI, 5%-33%] better, P = .02). Brief hypoglycemia evoked by TGC was not associated with worse neurocognitive outcome. CONCLUSION: At follow-up, children who had been treated with TGC during an ICU admission did not have a worse measure of intelligence than those who had received UC.

23712747,"Trends in tobacco and alcohol brand placements in popular US movies, 1996 through 2009.",JAMA Pediatr,Bergamini E and Demidenko E and Sargent JD,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Tobacco and alcohol use in movies could be influenced by product placement agreements. Tobacco brand placement was limited by the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) after 1998, while alcohol is subject to self-regulation only. OBJECTIVE: To examine recent trends for tobacco and alcohol use in movies. We expected that the MSA would be associated with declines in tobacco but not alcohol brand placement (hypothesis formulated after data collection). DESIGN: Content analysis. SETTING: Top 100 box-office hits released in the United States from 1996 through 2009 (N = 1400). INTERVENTION: The MSA, an agreement signed in 1998 between the state attorneys general and tobacco companies, ended payments for tobacco brand placements in movies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Trend for tobacco and alcohol brand counts and seconds of screen time for the pre-MSA period from 1996 through 1999 compared with the post-MSA period from 2000 through 2009. RESULTS: Altogether, the 1400 movies contained 500 tobacco and 2433 alcohol brand appearances. After implementation of the MSA, tobacco brand appearances dropped exponentially by 7.0% (95% CI, 5.4%-8.7%) each year, then held at a level of 22 per year after 2006. The MSA also heralded a drop in tobacco screen time for youth- and adult-rated movies (42.3% [95% CI, 24.1%-60.2%] and 85.4% [56.1%-100.0%], respectively). In contrast, there was little change in alcohol brand appearances or alcohol screen time overall. In addition, alcohol brand appearances in youth-rated movies trended upward during the period from 80 to 145 per year, an increase of 5.2 (95% CI, 2.4-7.9) appearances per year. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Tobacco brands in movies declined after implementation of externally enforced constraints on the practice, coinciding also with a decline in tobacco screen time and suggesting that enforced limits on tobacco brand placement also limited onscreen depictions of smoking. Alcohol brand placement, subject only to industry self-regulation, was found increasingly in movies rated for youth as young as 13 years, despite the industry's intent to avoid marketing to underage persons.",Alcohol Drinking/*trends Alcoholic Beverages/*statistics & numerical data Humans Marketing/*trends Motion Pictures as Topic/*trends Smoking/*trends Time Factors Tobacco Products/*statistics & numerical data United States/epidemiology
24005903,Pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to topical corticosteroids: a UK population-based cohort study.,JAMA Dermatol,Chi CC and Wang SH and Mayon-White R and Wojnarowska F,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Topical corticosteroids are indicated for pregnant women with skin conditions, but their safety in pregnancy is not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether maternal exposure to topical corticosteroids results in adverse pregnancy outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: United Kingdom National Health Service. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2658 pregnant women exposed to topical corticosteroid and 7246 unexposed pregnant women. EXPOSURE: Topical corticosteroids dispensed during pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Orofacial cleft, low birth weight, preterm delivery, fetal death, low Apgar score, and mode of delivery. RESULTS: No associations of maternal topical corticosteroid exposure with orofacial cleft, low birth weight, preterm delivery, fetal death, low Apgar score, and mode of delivery were found in the primary analysis (adjusted risk ratio [RR], 1.85 [95% CI, 0.22-15.20] [P = .57]; 0.97 [95% CI, 0.78-1.19] [P = .75]; 1.20 [95% CI, 0.73-1.96] [P = .48]; 1.07 [95% CI, 0.56-2.05] [P = .84]; 0.84 [95% CI, 0.54-1.31] [P = .45]; and P = .76, respectively). Stratified analyses based on potency did not reveal any significant associations in most of these categories either, but an exploratory analysis showed a significantly increased risk of low birth weight when the dispensed amount of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids exceeded 300 g during the entire pregnancy (adjusted RR, 7.74 [95% CI, 1.49-40.11]; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study reassuringly showed no associations of maternal topical corticosteroid exposure with orofacial cleft, preterm delivery, fetal death, low Apgar score, and mode of delivery. With this study and all available evidence taken together, the risk of low birth weight seems to correlate with the quantity of topical corticosteroid exposure.","Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/diagnosis/*etiology Administration, Topical Apgar Score Birth Weight Cohort Studies Dermatologic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Female Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/*adverse effects Great Britain Humans Infant, Low Birth Weight Infant, Newborn Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications/*chemically induced *Pregnancy Outcome Retrospective Studies Skin Cream Skin Diseases/drug therapy"
24337530,Association between traumatic brain injury and risk of posttraumatic stress disorder in active-duty Marines.,JAMA Psychiatry,Yurgil KA and Barkauskas DA and Vasterling JJ and Nievergelt CM and Larson GE and Schork NJ and Litz BT and Nash WP and Baker DG,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Whether traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been difficult to determine because of the prevalence of comorbid conditions, overlapping symptoms, and cross-sectional samples. OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which self-reported predeployment and deployment-related TBI confers increased risk of PTSD when accounting for combat intensity and predeployment mental health symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: As part of the prospective, longitudinal Marine Resiliency Study (June 2008 to May 2012), structured clinical interviews and self-report assessments were administered approximately 1 month before a 7-month deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan and again 3 to 6 months after deployment. The study was conducted at training areas on a Marine Corps base in southern California or at Veterans Affairs San Diego Medical Center. Participants for the final analytic sample were 1648 active-duty Marine and Navy servicemen who completed predeployment and postdeployment assessments. Reasons for exclusions were nondeployment (n = 34), missing data (n = 181), and rank of noncommissioned and commissioned officers (n = 66). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the total score on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) 3 months after deployment. RESULTS: At the predeployment assessment, 56.8% of the participants reported prior TBI; at postdeployment assessment, 19.8% reported sustaining TBI between predeployment and postdeployment assessments (ie, deployment-related TBI). Approximately 87.2% of deployment-related TBIs were mild; 250 of 287 participants (87.1%) who reported posttraumatic amnesia reported less than 24 hours of posttraumatic amnesia (37 reported >/= 24 hours), and 111 of 117 of those who lost consciousness (94.9%) reported less than 30 minutes of unconsciousness. Predeployment CAPS score and combat intensity score raised predicted 3-month postdeployment CAPS scores by factors of 1.02 (P < .001; 95% CI, 1.02-1.02) and 1.02 (P < .001; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02) per unit increase, respectively. Deployment-related mild TBI raised predicted CAPS scores by a factor of 1.23 (P < .001; 95% CI, 1.11-1.36), and moderate/severe TBI raised predicted scores by a factor of 1.71 (P < .001; 95% CI, 1.37-2.12). Probability of PTSD was highest for participants with severe predeployment symptoms, high combat intensity, and deployment-related TBI. Traumatic brain injury doubled or nearly doubled the PTSD rates for participants with less severe predeployment PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Even when accounting for predeployment symptoms, prior TBI, and combat intensity, TBI during the most recent deployment is the strongest predictor of postdeployment PTSD symptoms.","Adult Afghan Campaign 2001- Brain Injuries/complications/*epidemiology/physiopathology Combat Disorders/complications/epidemiology Comorbidity Humans Iraq War, 2003-2011 Male *Military Personnel/psychology/statistics & numerical data Prospective Studies Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Resilience, Psychological Risk Factors Severity of Illness Index Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*epidemiology/etiology Time Factors United States/epidemiology Young Adult"

OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between TBI and premature mortality, particularly by external causes, and determine the role of psychiatric comorbidity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We studied all persons born in 1954 or later in Sweden who received inpatient and outpatient International Classification of Diseases-based diagnoses of TBI from 1969 to 2009 (n = 218,300). We compared mortality rates 6 months or more after TBI to general population controls matched on age and sex (n = 2,163,190) and to unaffected siblings of patients with TBI (n = 150,513). Furthermore, we specifically examined external causes of death (suicide, injury, or assault). We conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate whether mortality rates differed by sex, age at death, severity (including concussion), and different follow-up times after diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of premature death by external causes in patients with TBI compared with general population controls. RESULTS: Among those who survived 6 months after TBI, we found a 3-fold increased odds of mortality (AOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 3.0-3.4) compared with general population controls and an adjusted increased odds of mortality of 2.6 (95% CI, 2.3-2.8) compared with unaffected siblings. Risks of mortality from external causes were elevated, including for suicide (AOR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.9-3.7), injuries (AOR, 4.3; 95% CI, 3.8-4.8), and assault (AOR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.7-5.7). Among those with TBI, absolute rates of death were high in those with any psychiatric or substance abuse comorbidity (3.8% died prematurely) and those with solely substance abuse (6.2%) compared with those without comorbidity (0.5%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Traumatic brain injury is associated with substantially elevated risks of premature mortality, particularly for suicide, injuries, and assaults, even after adjustment for sociodemographic and familial factors. Current clinical guidelines may need revision to reduce mortality risks beyond the first few months after injury and address high rates of psychiatric comorbidity and substance abuse.","Adolescent Adult Brain Injuries/*epidemiology *Cause of Death Child Comorbidity Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Mental Disorders/*epidemiology Middle Aged *Mortality, Premature Severity of Illness Index Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology Suicide/statistics & numerical data Sweden/epidemiology Time Factors Wounds and Injuries/epidemiology Young Adult"
23896698,Worsening trends in the management and treatment of back pain.,JAMA Intern Med,Mafi JN and McCarthy EP and Davis RB and Landon BE,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Back pain treatment is costly and frequently includes overuse of treatments that are unsupported by clinical guidelines. Few studies have evaluated recent national trends in guideline adherence of spine-related care. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the treatment of back pain from January 1, 1999, through December 26, 2010. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Using nationally representative data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, we studied outpatient visits with a chief symptom and/or primary diagnosis of back or neck pain, as well as those with secondary symptoms and diagnoses of back or neck pain. We excluded visits with concomitant ""red flags,"" including fever, neurologic symptoms, or cancer. Results were analyzed using logistic regression adjusted for patient and health care professional characteristics and weighted to reflect national estimates. We also present adjusted results stratified by symptom duration and whether the health care professional was the primary care physician (PCP). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We assessed imaging, narcotics, and referrals to physicians (guideline discordant indicators). In addition, we evaluated use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen and referrals to physical therapy (guideline concordant indicators). RESULTS: We identified 23,918 visits for spine problems, representing an estimated 440 million visits. Approximately 58% of patients were female. Mean age increased from 49 to 53 years (P< .001) during the study period. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or acetaminophen use per visit decreased from 36.9% in 1999-2000 to 24.5% in 2009-2010 (unadjusted P< .001). In contrast, narcotic use increased from 19.3% to 29.1% (P< .001). Although physical therapy referrals remained unchanged at approximately 20%, physician referrals increased from 6.8% to 14.0% (P< .001). The number of radiographs remained stable at approximately 17%, whereas the number of computed tomograms or magnetic resonance images increased from 7.2% to 11.3% during the study period (P< .001). These trends were similar after stratifying by short-term vs long-term presentations, visits to PCPs vs non-PCPs, and adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, PCP status, symptom duration, region, and metropolitan location. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite numerous published clinical guidelines, management of back pain has relied increasingly on guideline discordant care. Improvements in the management of spine-related disease represent an area of potential cost savings for the health care system with the potential for improving the quality of care.","Acetaminophen/therapeutic use Ambulatory Care/*statistics & numerical data Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/therapeutic use Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use Back Pain/epidemiology/*therapy Female Follow-Up Studies Guideline Adherence/*trends Health Care Surveys/*methods Humans Male Middle Aged Morbidity/trends Office Visits/*trends Physical Therapy Modalities *Physician's Practice Patterns Retrospective Studies Treatment Outcome United States/epidemiology"
23592107,Effect of shock wave-facilitated intracoronary cell therapy on LVEF in patients with chronic heart failure: the CELLWAVE randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Assmus B and Walter DH and Seeger FH and Leistner DM and Steiner J and Ziegler I and Lutz A and Khaled W and Klotsche J and Tonn T and Dimmeler S and Zeiher AM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The modest effects of clinical studies using intracoronary administration of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMCs) in patients with chronic postinfarction heart failure may be attributed to impaired homing of BMCs to the target area. Extracorporeal shock wave treatment has been experimentally shown to increase homing factors in the target tissue, resulting in enhanced retention of applied BMCs. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that targeted cardiac shock wave pretreatment with subsequent application of BMCs improves recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with chronic heart failure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The CELLWAVE double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted among patients with chronic heart failure treated at Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, between 2006 and 2011. INTERVENTIONS: Single-blind low-dose (n = 42), high-dose (n = 40), or placebo (n = 21) shock wave pretreatment targeted to the left ventricular anterior wall. Twenty-four hours later, patients receiving shock wave pretreatment were randomized to receive double-blind intracoronary infusion of BMCs or placebo, and patients receiving placebo shock wave received intracoronary infusion of BMCs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end point was change in LVEF from baseline to 4 months in the pooled groups shock wave + placebo infusion vs shock wave + BMCs; secondary end points included regional left ventricular function assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and clinical events. RESULTS: The primary end point was significantly improved in the shock wave + BMCs group (absolute change in LVEF, 3.2% [95% CI, 2.0% to 4.4%]), compared with the shock wave + placebo infusion group (1.0% [95% CI, -0.3% to 2.2%]) (P = .02). Regional wall thickening improved significantly in the shock wave + BMCs group (3.6% [95% CI, 2.0% to 5.2%]) but not in the shock wave + placebo infusion group (0.5% [95% CI, -1.2% to 2.1%]) (P = .01). Overall occurrence of major adverse cardiac events was significantly less frequent in the shock wave + BMCs group (n = 32 events) compared with the placebo shock wave + BMCs (n = 18) and shock wave + placebo infusion (n = 61) groups (hazard ratio, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.40-0.85]; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with postinfarction chronic heart failure, shock wave-facilitated intracoronary administration of BMCs vs shock wave treatment alone resulted in a significant, albeit modest, improvement in LVEF at 4 months. Determining whether the increase in contractile function will translate into improved clinical outcomes requires confirmation in larger clinical end point trials.

In addition, there is a concern that prolonged exposure therapy for PTSD may exacerbate alcohol use. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of an evidence-based treatment for alcohol dependence (naltrexone) plus an evidence-based treatment for PTSD (prolonged exposure therapy), their combination, and supportive counseling. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A single-blind, randomized clinical trial of 165 participants with PTSD and alcohol dependence conducted at the University of Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Veterans Administration. Participant enrollment began on February 8, 2001, and ended on June 25, 2009. Data collection was completed on August 12, 2010. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to (1) prolonged exposure therapy plus naltrexone (100 mg/d), (2) prolonged exposure therapy plus pill placebo, (3) supportive counseling plus naltrexone (100 mg/d), or (4) supportive counseling plus pill placebo. Prolonged exposure therapy was composed of 12 weekly 90-minute sessions followed by 6 biweekly sessions. All participants received supportive counseling. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The Timeline Follow-Back Interview and the PTSD Symptom Severity Interview were used to assess the percentage of days drinking alcohol and PTSD severity, respectively, and the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale was used to assess alcohol craving. Independent evaluations occurred prior to treatment (week 0), at posttreatment (week 24), and at 6 months after treatment discontinuation (week 52). RESULTS: Participants in all 4 treatment groups had large reductions in the percentage of days drinking (mean change, -63.9% [95% CI, -73.6% to -54.2%] for prolonged exposure therapy plus naltrexone; -63.9% [95% CI, -73.9% to -53.8%] for prolonged exposure therapy plus placebo; -69.9% [95% CI, -78.7% to -61.2%] for supportive counseling plus naltrexone; and -61.0% [95% CI, -68.9% to -53.0%] for supportive counseling plus placebo). However, those who received naltrexone had lower percentages of days drinking than those who received placebo (mean difference, 7.93%; P = .008). There was also a reduction in PTSD symptoms in all 4 groups, but the main effect of prolonged exposure therapy was not statistically significant. Six months after the end of treatment, participants in all 4 groups had increases in percentage of days drinking. However, those in the prolonged exposure therapy plus naltrexone group had the smallest increases. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study of patients with alcohol dependence and PTSD, naltrexone treatment resulted in a decrease in the percentage of days drinking. Prolonged exposure therapy was not associated with an exacerbation of alcohol use disorder.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether endoscopic radiofrequency ablation could decrease the rate of neoplastic progression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter randomized clinical trial that enrolled 136 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Barrett esophagus containing low-grade dysplasia at 9 European sites between June 2007 and June 2011. Patient follow-up ended May 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either endoscopic treatment with radiofrequency ablation (ablation) or endoscopic surveillance (control). Ablation was performed with the balloon device for circumferential ablation of the esophagus or the focal device for targeted ablation, with a maximum of 5 sessions allowed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was neoplastic progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma during a 3-year follow-up since randomization. Secondary outcomes were complete eradication of dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia and adverse events. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were randomized to receive ablation and 68 to receive control. Ablation reduced the risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma by 25.0% (1.5% for ablation vs 26.5% for control; 95% CI, 14.1%-35.9%; P < .001) and the risk of progression to adenocarcinoma by 7.4% (1.5% for ablation vs 8.8% for control; 95% CI, 0%-14.7%; P = .03). Among patients in the ablation group, complete eradication occurred in 92.6% for dysplasia and 88.2% for intestinal metaplasia compared with 27.9% for dysplasia and 0.0% for intestinal metaplasia among patients in the control group (P < .001). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19.1% of patients receiving ablation (P < .001). The most common adverse event was stricture, occurring in 8 patients receiving ablation (11.8%), all resolved by endoscopic dilation (median, 1 session). The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the trial due to superiority of ablation for the primary outcome and the potential for patient safety issues if the trial continued. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized trial of patients with Barrett esophagus and a confirmed diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia, radiofrequency ablation resulted in a reduced risk of neoplastic progression over 3 years of follow-up.

24549549,Radiofrequency ablation vs antiarrhythmic drugs as first-line treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (RAAFT-2): a randomized trial.,JAMA,Morillo CA and Verma A and Connolly SJ and Kuck KH and Nair GM and Champagne J and Sterns LD and Beresh H and Healey JS and Natale A,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common rhythm disorder seen in clinical practice. Antiarrhythmic drugs are effective for reduction of recurrence in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF. Radiofrequency ablation is an accepted therapy in patients for whom antiarrhythmic drugs have failed; however, its role as a first-line therapy needs further investigation. OBJECTIVE: To compare radiofrequency ablation with antiarrhythmic drugs (standard therapy) in treating patients with paroxysmal AF as a first-line therapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A randomized clinical trial involving 127 treatment-naive patients with paroxysmal AF were randomized at 16 centers in Europe and North America to received either antiarrhythmic therapy or ablation. The first patient was enrolled July 27, 2006; the last patient, January 29, 2010. The last follow-up was February 16, 2012. INTERVENTIONS: Sixty-one patients in the antiarrhythmic drug group and 66 in the radiofrequency ablation group were followed up for 24 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The time to the first documented atrial tachyarrhythmia of more than 30 seconds (symptomatic or asymptomatic AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia), detected by either scheduled or unscheduled electrocardiogram, Holter, transtelephonic monitor, or rhythm strip, was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included symptomatic recurrences of atrial tachyarrhythmias and quality of life measures assessed by the EQ-5D tool. RESULTS: Forty-four patients (72.1%) in the antiarrhythmic group and in 36 patients (54.5%) in the ablation group experienced the primary efficacy outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 0.56 [95% CI, 0.35-0.90]; P = .02). For the secondary outcomes, 59% in the drug group and 47% in the ablation group experienced the first recurrence of symptomatic AF, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.33-0.95]; P = .03). No deaths or strokes were reported in either group; 4 cases of cardiac tamponade were reported in the ablation group. In the standard treatment group, 26 patients (43%) underwent ablation after 1-year. Quality of life was moderately impaired at baseline in both groups and improved at the 1 year follow-up. However, improvement was not significantly different among groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with paroxysmal AF without previous antiarrhythmic drug treatment, radiofrequency ablation compared with antiarrhythmic drugs resulted in a lower rate of recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias at 2 years.

23695483,Effect of escitalopram on mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia: results of the REMIT trial.,JAMA,Jiang W and Velazquez EJ and Kuchibhatla M and Samad Z and Boyle SH and Kuhn C and Becker RC and Ortel TL and Williams RB and Rogers JG and O'Connor C,duke,"IMPORTANCE: Mental stress can induce myocardial ischemia and also has been implicated in triggering cardiac events. However, pharmacological interventions aimed at reducing mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) have not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of 6 weeks of escitalopram treatment vs placebo on MSIMI and other psychological stress-related biophysiological and emotional parameters. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The REMIT (Responses of Mental Stress Induced Myocardial Ischemia to Escitalopram Treatment) study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients with clinically stable coronary heart disease and laboratory-diagnosed MSIMI. Enrollment occurred from July 24, 2007, through August 24, 2011, at a tertiary medical center. INTERVENTIONS: Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to receive escitalopram (dose began at 5 mg/d, with titration to 20 mg/d in 3 weeks) or placebo over 6 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Occurrence of MSIMI, defined as development or worsening of regional wall motion abnormality; left ventricular ejection fraction reduction of 8% or more; and/or horizontal or down-sloping ST-segment depression of 1 mm or more in 2 or more leads, lasting for 3 or more consecutive beats, during 1 or more of 3 mental stressor tasks. RESULTS: Of 127 participants randomized to receive escitalopram (n = 64) or placebo (n = 63), 112 (88.2%) completed end point assessments (n = 56 in each group). At the end of 6 weeks, more patients taking escitalopram (34.2% [95% CI, 25.4%-43.0%]) had absence of MSIMI during the 3 mental stressor tasks compared with patients taking placebo (17.5% [95% CI, 10.4%-24.5%]), based on the unadjusted multiple imputation model for intention-to-treat analysis. A significant difference favoring escitalopram was observed (odds ratio, 2.62 [95% CI, 1.06-6.44]). Rates of exercise-induced ischemia were slightly lower at 6 weeks in the escitalopram group (45.8% [95% CI, 36.6%-55.0%]) than in patients receiving placebo (52.5% [95% CI, 43.3%-61.8%]), but this difference was not statistically significant (adjusted odds ratio; 1.24 [95% CI, 0.60-2.58]; P = .56). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with stable coronary heart disease and baseline MSIMI, 6 weeks of escitalopram, compared with placebo, resulted in a lower rate of MSIMI. There was no statistically significant difference in exercise-induced ischemia. Replication of these results in multicenter settings and investigations of other medications for reducing MSIMI are needed.

23400279,Comparing 3 techniques for eliciting patient values for decision making about prostate-specific antigen screening: a randomized controlled trial.,JAMA Intern Med,Pignone MP and Howard K and Brenner AT and Crutchfield TM and Hawley ST and Lewis CL and Sheridan SL,unc,"IMPORTANCE: To make good decisions about prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, men must consider how they value the different potential outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of different methods of helping men consider such values. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized trial from October 12 to 27, 2011, in the general community. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 911 men aged 50 to 70 years from the United States and Australia who had average risk. Participants were drawn from online panels from a survey research firm in each country and were randomized by the survey firm to 1 of 3 values clarification methods: a balance sheet (n = 302), a rating and ranking task (n = 307), or a discrete choice experiment (n = 302). INTERVENTION: Participants underwent a values clarification task and then chose the most important attribute. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome was the difference among groups in the most important attribute. Secondary outcomes were differences in unlabeled test preference and intent to undergo screening with PSA. RESULTS: The mean age was 59.8 years; most participants were white and more than one-third had graduated from college. More than 40% reported a PSA test within 12 months. The participants who received the rating and ranking task were more likely to report reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer as being most important (54.4%) compared with those who received the balance sheet (35.1%) or the discrete choice experiment (32.5%) (P < .001). Those receiving the balance sheet were more likely (43.7%) to prefer the unlabeled PSA-like option (as opposed to the ""no screening""-like option) compared with those who received rating and ranking (34.2%) or the discrete choice experiment (20.2%). However, the proportion who intended to undergo PSA testing was high and did not differ between groups (balance sheet, 77.1%; rating and ranking, 76.8%; and discrete choice experiment, 73.5%; P = .73). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Different values clarification methods produce different patterns of attribute importance and different preferences for screening when presented with an unlabeled choice. Further studies with more distal outcome measures are needed to determine the best method of values clarification, if any, for decisions such as whether to undergo screening with PSA.","Aged Australia Choice Behavior Data Interpretation, Statistical Decision Making Educational Status Ethnic Groups Humans Male Mass Screening/*methods Middle Aged Outcome Assessment (Health Care) *Patient Navigation/methods/standards *Patient Participation/methods/psychology Preventive Health Services/methods/organization & administration Prostate-Specific Antigen/*blood *Prostatic Neoplasms/blood/diagnosis/prevention & control/psychology Questionnaires United States"

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, the most common conversion disorder, are as disabling as epilepsy and are not adequately addressed or treated by mental health clinicians. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate different PNES treatments compared with standard medical care (treatment as usual). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Pilot randomized clinical trial at 3 academic medical centers with mental health clinicians trained to administer psychotherapy or psychopharmacology to outpatients with PNES. Thirty-eight participants were randomized in a blocked schedule among 3 sites to 1 of 4 treatment arms and were followed up for 16 weeks between September 2008 and February 2012; 34 were included in the analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Medication (flexible-dose sertraline hydrochloride) only, cognitive behavioral therapy informed psychotherapy (CBT-ip) only, CBT-ip with medication (sertraline), or treatment as usual. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Seizure frequency was the primary outcome; psychosocial and functioning measures, including psychiatric symptoms, social interactions, quality of life, and global functioning, were secondary outcomes. Data were collected prospectively, weekly, and with baseline, week 2, midpoint (week 8), and exit (week 16) batteries. Within-group analyses for each arm were performed on primary (seizure frequency) and secondary outcomes from treatment-blinded raters using an intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: The psychotherapy (CBT-ip) arm showed a 51.4% seizure reduction (P = .01) and significant improvement from baseline in secondary measures including depression, anxiety, quality of life, and global functioning (P < .001). The combined arm (CBT-ip with sertraline) showed 59.3% seizure reduction (P = .008) and significant improvements in some secondary measures, including global functioning (P = .007). The sertraline-only arm did not show a reduction in seizures (P = .08). The treatment as usual group showed no significant seizure reduction or improvement in secondary outcome measures (P = .19). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This pilot randomized clinical trial for PNES revealed significant seizure reduction and improved comorbid symptoms and global functioning with CBT-ip for PNES without and with sertraline. There were no improvements in the sertraline-only or treatment-as-usual arms. This study supports the use of manualized psychotherapy for PNES and successful training of mental health clinicians in the treatment. Future studies could assess larger-scale intervention dissemination. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00835627.",Missing

Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) has been used successfully to remit autoimmune-mediated neurological diseases. We report 2 cases of severe SPS treated with auto-HSCT, a novel therapy for this disease. Observations: Two anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody-positive patients with SPS had an autologous hematopoietic stem cell graft collected and stored. Subsequently, the patients underwent auto-HSCT. Both patients achieved clinical remission with sustained, marked improvement in symptoms and a return to premorbid functioning, now more than 2.5 and 4.5 years after the procedure. Conclusions and Relevance: Stiff person syndrome represents a novel indication for auto-HSCT. The resolution of clinical manifestations of SPS despite the persistence of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies following auto-HSCT suggests that the antibody does not play a direct role in pathogenesis of SPS.",Missing

Radiotherapy is indicated after prostatectomy in select patients who have adverse pathologic features and in those with recurrent disease. OBJECTIVES: To examine the patterns of use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), a newer, more expensive technology that may reduce radiation dose to adjacent organs compared with the older conformal radiotherapy (CRT) in the postprostatectomy setting, and to compare disease control and morbidity outcomes of these treatments. DESIGN AND SETTING: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare-linked database were used to identify patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer who had received radiotherapy within 3 years after prostatectomy. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who received IMRT or CRT. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcomes of 457 IMRT and 557 CRT patients who received radiotherapy between 2002 and 2007 were compared using their claims through 2009. We used propensity score methods to balance baseline characteristics and estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (RRs) and their 95% CIs for measured outcomes. RESULTS: Use of IMRT increased from zero in 2000 to 82.1% in 2009. Men who received IMRT vs CRT showed no significant difference in rates of long-term gastrointestinal morbidity (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.66-1.37), urinary nonincontinent morbidity (0.93; 0.66-1.33), urinary incontinence (0.98; 0.71-1.35), or erectile dysfunction (0.85; 0.61-1.19). There was no significant difference in subsequent treatment for recurrent disease (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.90-1.92). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Postprostatectomy IMRT and CRT achieved similar morbidity and cancer control outcomes. The potential clinical benefit of IMRT in this setting is unclear. Given that IMRT is more expensive, its use for postprostatectomy radiotherapy may not be cost-effective compared with CRT, although formal analysis is needed.","Aged Cohort Studies Comparative Effectiveness Research Cost-Benefit Analysis Humans Male Postoperative Period *Prostatectomy Prostatic Neoplasms/*radiotherapy Radiation Dosage *Radiotherapy, Conformal *Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated/adverse effects/economics Treatment Outcome"

OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible dose-response associations of young children's electronic media use with their later well-being. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The IDEFICS (Identification and Prevention of Dietary- and Lifestyle-Induced Health Effects in Children and Infants) study is a prospective cohort study with an intervention component. Data were collected at baseline from September 1, 2007, through June 30, 2008, and at follow-up from September 1, 2009, through May 31, 2010, in 8 European countries participating in the IDEFICS study. This investigation is based on 3604 children aged 2 to 6 years who participated in the longitudinal component of the IDEFICS study only and not in the intervention. EXPOSURE: Early childhood electronic media use. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The following 6 indicators of well-being from 2 validated instruments were used as outcomes at follow-up: Peer problems and Emotional problems subscales from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Emotional well-being, Self-esteem, Family functioning, and Social networks subscales from the KINDLR (Questionnaire for Measuring Health-Related Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents-Revised Version). Each scale was dichotomized to identify those children at risk for poorer outcomes. Indicators of electronic media use (weekday and weekend television and electronic game [e-game]/computer use) from baseline were used as predictors. RESULTS: Associations varied between boys and girls; however, associations suggested that increased levels of electronic media use predicted poorer well-being outcomes. Television viewing on weekdays or weekends was more consistently associated with poorer outcomes than e-game/computer use. Across associations, the likelihood of adverse outcomes in children ranged from a 1.2- to 2.0-fold increase for emotional problems and poorer family functioning for each additional hour of television viewing or e-game/computer use depending on the outcome examined. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Higher levels of early childhood electronic media use are associated with children being at risk for poorer outcomes with some indicators of well-being. Further research is required to identify potential mechanisms.","Body Weight Child Child, Preschool Computers/*statistics & numerical data Female *Health Status Humans Male Prospective Studies Questionnaires Risk Factors Television/*statistics & numerical data Time Factors"
24681960,"Comparison of application of the ACC/AHA guidelines, Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and European Society of Cardiology guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention in a European cohort.",JAMA,Kavousi M and Leening MJ and Nanchen D and Greenland P and Graham IM and Steyerberg EW and Ikram MA and Stricker BH and Hofman A and Franco OH,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines introduced a prediction model and lowered the threshold for treatment with statins to a 7.5% 10-year hard atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. Implications of the new guideline's threshold and model have not been addressed in non-US populations or compared with previous guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To determine population-wide implications of the ACC/AHA, the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III), and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines using a cohort of Dutch individuals aged 55 years or older. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We included 4854 Rotterdam Study participants recruited in 1997-2001. We calculated 10-year risks for ""hard"" ASCVD events (including fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease [CHD] and stroke) (ACC/AHA), hard CHD events (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, CHD mortality) (ATP-III), and atherosclerotic CVD mortality (ESC). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Events were assessed until January 1, 2012. Per guideline, we calculated proportions of individuals for whom statins would be recommended and determined calibration and discrimination of risk models. RESULTS: The mean age was 65.5 (SD, 5.2) years. Statins would be recommended for 96.4% (95% CI, 95.4%-97.1%; n = 1825) of men and 65.8% (95% CI, 63.8%-67.7%; n = 1523) of women by the ACC/AHA, 52.0% (95% CI, 49.8%-54.3%; n = 985) of men and 35.5% (95% CI, 33.5%-37.5%; n = 821) of women by the ATP-III, and 66.1% (95% CI, 64.0%-68.3%; n = 1253) of men and 39.1% (95% CI, 37.1%-41.2%; n = 906) of women by ESC guidelines. With the ACC/AHA model, average predicted risk vs observed cumulative incidence of hard ASCVD events was 21.5% (95% CI, 20.9%-22.1%) vs 12.7% (95% CI, 11.1%-14.5%) for men (192 events) and 11.6% (95% CI, 11.2%-12.0%) vs 7.9% (95% CI, 6.7%-9.2%) for women (151 events). Similar overestimation occurred with the ATP-III model (98 events in men and 62 events in women) and ESC model (50 events in men and 37 events in women). The C statistic was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.63-0.71) in men and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.64-0.73) in women for hard ASCVD (ACC/AHA), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.62-0.72) in men and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.63-0.75) in women for hard CHD (ATP-III), and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.70-0.82) in men and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.71-0.83) in women for CVD mortality (ESC). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this European population aged 55 years or older, proportions of individuals eligible for statins differed substantially among the guidelines. The ACC/AHA guideline would recommend statins for nearly all men and two-thirds of women, proportions exceeding those with the ATP-III or ESC guidelines. All 3 risk models provided poor calibration and moderate to good discrimination. Improving risk predictions and setting appropriate population-wide thresholds are necessary to facilitate better clinical decision making.","Aged American Heart Association Cardiology Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/*prevention & control Cohort Studies Europe Female Humans Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use Male Middle Aged Models, Theoretical Netherlands *Practice Guidelines as Topic Risk Assessment/*methods Risk Factors Societies, Medical Stroke/epidemiology United States"

Although the short-term outcome of UHR patients has been well researched, the long-term outcome is not known. OBJECTIVE: To assess the rate and baseline predictors of transition to psychotic disorder in UHR patients up to 15 years after study entry. DESIGN: Follow-up study of a cohort of UHR patients recruited to participate in research studies between 1993 and 2006. SETTING: The Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation (PACE) clinic, a specialized service for UHR patients in Melbourne, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred sixteen UHR patients previously seen at the PACE clinic. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Transition to psychotic disorder, as measured using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale/Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History, or state public mental health records. RESULTS: During the time to follow-up (2.4-14.9 years after presentation), 114 of the 416 participants were known to have developed a psychotic disorder. The highest risk for transition was within the first 2 years of entry into the service, but individuals continued to be at risk up to 10 years after initial referral. The overall rate of transition was estimated to be 34.9% over a 10-year period (95% CI, 28.7%-40.6%). Factors associated with transition included year of entry into the clinic, duration of symptoms before clinic entry, baseline functioning, negative symptoms, and disorders of thought content. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The UHR patients are at long-term risk for psychotic disorder, with the highest risk in the first 2 years. Services should aim to follow up patients for at least this period, with the possibility to return for care after this time. Individuals with a long duration of symptoms and poor functioning at the time of referral may need closer monitoring.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between undervaccination and pertussis in children 3 to 36 months of age. DESIGN: Matched case-control study with conditional logistic regression analysis. SETTING: Eight managed care organizations of the Vaccine Safety Datalink between 2004 and 2010. PARTICIPANTS: Each laboratory-confirmed case of pertussis (72 patients) was matched to 4 randomly selected controls (for a total of 288 controls). The case patients were matched to controls by managed care organization site, sex, and age at the index date. The index date was defined as the date of pertussis diagnosis for the case patients. EXPOSURE: Undervaccination for the diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. Undervaccination was defined as the number of doses of DTaP vaccine that was either missing or delayed by the index date. Case patients and controls could be undervaccinated by 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 doses of DTaP vaccine. Children undervaccinated by 0 doses were considered age-appropriately vaccinated by the index date. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Pertussis. RESULTS: Of the 72 case patients with pertussis, 12 (16.67%) were hospitalized, and 34 (47.22%) were undervaccinated for DTaP vaccine by the date of pertussis diagnosis. Of the 288 matched controls, 64 (22.22%) were undervaccinated for DTaP vaccine. Undervaccination was strongly associated with pertussis.

Data from large real-world practice samples are needed to improve risk factor estimates for late-stage liver events and death in HCV. OBJECTIVE: To describe the natural history of HCV in real-world clinical practice. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational cohort study. Patients with a detectable viral load (>25 IU/mL) and a recorded baseline genotype were selected from the Veterans Affairs (VA) HCV clinical registry (CCR), which compiles electronic medical records data from 1999 to present. EXPOSURES: Risk factors included genotype, race, age, sex, and time to achieving an observed undetected viral load. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were time to death and time to a composite of liver-related clinical events. Secondary outcomes included the components of the composite clinical outcome. Outcomes were measured using a time-to-event format and were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS A total of 28,769 of 360,857 unique HCV CCR patients met all study criteria. Only 24.3% of patients received treatment, and 16.4% of treated patients (4.0% of all patients) achieved an undetectable viral load. The unadjusted death rates were 6.8 (95% CI, 6.0-7.7) per 1000 person-years for patients who achieved viral load suppression vs 21.8 (95% CI, 21.5-22.2) deaths per 1000 person-years in patients who did not achieve this goal. Cox model results found that achieving viral suppression reduced risk of the composite clinical end point by 27% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.66-0.82]) and the risk of death by 45% (HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.47-0.64]). Genotype 2 patients were at significantly lower risk, and genotype 3 patients were at higher risk for all study outcomes relative to genotype 1. Black patients were at lower risk for all liver events than white patients. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Achieving an undetectable viral load was associated with decreased hepatic morbidity and mortality. It remains to be determined whether newer treatment regimens can offer higher response rates with fewer adverse effects in real-world settings.","Female Follow-Up Studies Hepacivirus/genetics Hepatitis C, Chronic/*epidemiology/virology Humans Male Middle Aged Morbidity/trends Proportional Hazards Models RNA, Viral/analysis *Registries Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment/*methods Risk Factors Survival Rate/trends Time Factors United States/epidemiology United States Department of Veterans Affairs"
23401888,The cumulative effect of unemployment on risks for acute myocardial infarction.,Arch Intern Med,Dupre ME and George LK and Liu G and Peterson ED,duke,"BACKGROUND: Employment instability is a major source of strain affecting an increasing number of adults in the United States. Little is known about the cumulative effect of multiple job losses and unemployment on the risks for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: We investigated the associations between different dimensions of unemployment and the risks for AMI in US adults in a prospective cohort study of adults (N = 13,451) aged 51 to 75 years in the Health and Retirement Study with biennial follow-up interviews from 1992 to 2010. Unadjusted rates of age-specific AMI were used to demonstrate observed differences by employment status, cumulative number of job losses, and cumulative time unemployed. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the multivariate effects of cumulative work histories on AMI while adjusting for sociodemographic background and confounding risk factors. RESULTS: The median age of the study cohort was 62 years, and 1061 AMI events (7.9%) occurred during the 165,169 person-years of observation. Among the sample, 14.0% of subjects were unemployed at baseline, 69.7% had 1 or more cumulative job losses, and 35.1% had spent time unemployed. Unadjusted plots showed that age-specific rates of AMI differed significantly for each dimension of work history. Multivariate models showed that AMI risks were significantly higher among the unemployed (hazard ratio, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.10-1.66]) and that risks increased incrementally from 1 job loss (1.22 [1.04-1.42]) to 4 or more cumulative job losses (1.63 [1.29-2.07]) compared with no job loss. Risks for AMI were particularly elevated within the first year of unemployment (hazard ratio, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.01-1.60]) but not thereafter. Results were robust after adjustments for multiple clinical, socioeconomic, and behavioral risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Unemployment status, multiple job losses, and short periods without work are all significant risk factors for acute cardiovascular events.","Female Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Myocardial Infarction/*epidemiology/etiology/psychology Prognosis Proportional Hazards Models Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Stress, Psychological/*complications/epidemiology/psychology Survival Rate/trends Unemployment/*psychology United States/epidemiology"

Data were collected from June 2009 to October 2011. INTERVENTIONS: CPAP or no therapy while maintaining usual blood pressure control medication. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the change in 24-hour mean blood pressure after 12 weeks. Secondary end points included changes in other blood pressure values and changes in nocturnal blood pressure patterns. Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 194 patients were randomly assigned to receive CPAP (n = 98) or no CPAP (control; n = 96). The mean AHI was 40.4 (SD, 18.9) and an average of 3.8 antihypertensive drugs were taken per patient. Baseline 24-hour mean blood pressure was 103.4 mm Hg; systolic blood pressure (SBP), 144.2 mm Hg; and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), 83 mm Hg. At baseline, 25.8% of patients displayed a dipper pattern (a decrease of at least 10% in the average nighttime blood pressure compared with the average daytime blood pressure). The percentage of patients using CPAP for 4 or more hours per day was 72.4%. When the changes in blood pressure over the study period were compared between groups by ITT, the CPAP group achieved a greater decrease in 24-hour mean blood pressure (3.1 mm Hg [95% CI, 0.6 to 5.6]; P = .02) and 24-hour DBP (3.2 mm Hg [95% CI, 1.0 to 5.4]; P = .005), but not in 24-hour SBP (3.1 mm Hg [95% CI, -0.6 to 6.7]; P = .10) compared with the control group. Moreover, the percentage of patients displaying a nocturnal blood pressure dipper pattern at the 12-week follow-up was greater in the CPAP group than in the control group (35.9% vs 21.6%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.4 [95% CI, 1.2 to 5.1]; P = .02). There was a significant positive correlation between hours of CPAP use and the decrease in 24-hour mean blood pressure (r = 0.29, P = .006), SBP (r = 0.25; P = .02), and DBP (r = 0.30, P = .005). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with OSA and resistant hypertension, CPAP treatment for 12 weeks compared with control resulted in a decrease in 24-hour mean and diastolic blood pressure and an improvement in the nocturnal blood pressure pattern. Further research is warranted to assess longer-term health outcomes.

23385271,Effect of ramipril on walking times and quality of life among patients with peripheral artery disease and intermittent claudication: a randomized controlled trial.,JAMA,Ahimastos AA and Walker PJ and Askew C and Leicht A and Pappas E and Blombery P and Reid CM and Golledge J and Kingwell BA,alfred,"IMPORTANCE: Approximately one-third of patients with peripheral artery disease experience intermittent claudication, with consequent loss of quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of ramipril for improving walking ability, patient-perceived walking performance, and quality of life in patients with claudication. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 212 patients with peripheral artery disease (mean age, 65.5 [SD, 6.2] years), initiated in May 2008 and completed in August 2011 and conducted at 3 hospitals in Australia. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive 10 mg/d of ramipril (n = 106) or matching placebo (n = 106) for 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maximum and pain-free walking times were recorded during a standard treadmill test. The Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) and Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) were used to assess walking ability and quality of life, respectively. RESULTS: At 6 months, relative to placebo, ramipril was associated with a 75-second (95% CI, 60-89 seconds) increase in mean pain-free walking time (P < .001) and a 255-second (95% CI, 215-295 seconds) increase in maximum walking time (P < .001). Relative to placebo, ramipril improved the WIQ median distance score by 13.8 (Hodges-Lehmann 95% CI, 12.2-15.5), speed score by 13.3 (95% CI, 11.9-15.2), and stair climbing score by 25.2 (95% CI, 25.1-29.4) (P < .001 for all). The overall SF-36 median Physical Component Summary score improved by 8.2 (Hodges-Lehmann 95% CI, 3.6-11.4; P = .02) in the ramipril group relative to placebo. Ramipril did not affect the overall SF-36 median Mental Component Summary score. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with intermittent claudication, 24-week treatment with ramipril resulted in significant increases in pain-free and maximum treadmill walking times compared with placebo. This was associated with a significant increase in the physical functioning component of the SF-36 score.

23860987,Androgen deprivation therapy and risk of acute kidney injury in patients with prostate cancer.,JAMA,Lapi F and Azoulay L and Niazi MT and Yin H and Benayoun S and Suissa S,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: The use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer has been shown to delay the clinical progression of the disease. However, the testosterone suppression associated with this therapy may lead to a hypogonadal condition that can have detrimental effects on renal function, thus raising the hypothesis that ADT-induced hypogonadism could potentially lead to acute kidney injury (AKI). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of ADT is associated with an increased risk of AKI in patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: A nested case-control analysis using medical information extracted from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to the Hospital Episodes Statistics database. PARTICIPANTS: Men newly diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2008, were selected and followed up until December 31, 2009. Cases were patients with incident AKI during follow-up who were randomly matched with up to 20 controls on age, calendar year of prostate cancer diagnosis, and duration of follow-up. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs of AKI associated with the use of ADT. ADT was categorized into 1 of 6 mutually exclusive groups: gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, oral antiandrogens, combined androgen blockade, bilateral orchiectomy, estrogens, and combination of the above. RESULTS A total of 10,250 patients met the study inclusion criteria. During a mean follow-up of 4.1 (SD, 2.9) years, 232 incident cases of AKI were identified (rate, 5.5/1000 person-years). Overall, current use of any ADT was associated with an increased risk of AKI when compared with never use (OR, 2.48 [95% CI, 1.61-3.82]), generating a rate difference of 4.43/1000 persons per year (95% CI, 1.54-7.33). This association was mainly driven by a combined androgen blockade consisting of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists with oral antiandrogens (OR, 4.50 [95% CI, 2.61-7.78]), estrogens (OR, 4.00 [95% CI, 1.06-15.03]), other combination therapies (OR, 4.04 [95% CI, 1.88-8.69]), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (OR, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.20-3.10]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic prostate cancer, the use of ADT was significantly associated with an increased risk of AKI. These findings require replication in other well-designed studies as well as further investigation of their clinical importance.","Acute Kidney Injury/*chemically induced/epidemiology Aged Aged, 80 and over Androgen Antagonists/*adverse effects/therapeutic use Case-Control Studies Estrogens/therapeutic use Follow-Up Studies Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/agonists Humans Male Odds Ratio Orchiectomy Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy Risk"
23280224,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and risk of stillbirth and infant mortality.,JAMA,Stephansson O and Kieler H and Haglund B and Artama M and Engeland A and Furu K and Gissler M and Norgaard M and Nielsen RB and Zoega H and Valdimarsdottir U,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Maternal psychiatric disease is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy has been associated with congenital anomalies, neonatal withdrawal syndrome, and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. However, the risk of stillbirth and infant mortality when accounting for previous maternal psychiatric disease remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To study risk of stillbirth and infant mortality associated with use of SSRIs during pregnancy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study from all Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) at different periods from 1996 through 2007. The study included women with singleton births. We obtained information on maternal use of SSRIs from prescription registries. Maternal characteristics, pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes were obtained from patient and medical birth registries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We used logistic regression to estimate relative risks of stillbirth, neonatal death, and postneonatal death associated with SSRI use during pregnancy taking into account maternal characteristics and previous psychiatric hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 1,633,877 singleton births in the study, 6054 were stillbirths; 3609, neonatal deaths; and 1578, postneonatal deaths. A total of 29,228 (1.79%) of mothers had filled a prescription for an SSRI during pregnancy. Women exposed to an SSRI presented with higher rates of stillbirth (4.62 vs 3.69 per 1000, P = .01) and postneonatal death (1.38 vs 0.96 per 1000, P = .03) than those who did not. The rate of neonatal death was similar between groups (2.54 vs 2.21 per 1000, P = .24). Yet in multivariable models, SSRI use was not associated with stillbirth (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.17; 95% CI, 0.96-1.41; P = .12), neonatal death (adjusted OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.96-1.57; P = .11), or postneonatal death (adjusted OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.97-1.86; P = .08). Estimates were further attenuated when stratified by previous hospitalization for psychiatric disease. The adjusted OR for stillbirth in women with a previous hospitalization for psychiatric disease was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.66-1.28; P = .62) and was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.84-1.36; P = .59) for those who had not been previously hospitalized. The corresponding ORs for neonatal death were 0.89 (95% CI, 0.58-1.39; P = .62) for women who were hospitalized and 1.14 (95% CI, 0.84-1.56; P = .39) for women who were not. For postneonatal death, the ORs were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.61-1.69; P = .95) for women who were hospitalized and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.71-1.72; P = .66) for women who were not. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among women with singleton births in Nordic countries, no significant association was found between use of SSRIs during pregnancy and risk of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, or postneonatal mortality. However, decisions about use of SSRIs during pregnancy must take into account other perinatal outcomes and the risks associated with maternal mental illness.","Adult Cohort Studies Decision Making Female Humans Infant Infant Mortality Infant, Newborn Logistic Models Mental Disorders/*drug therapy Middle Aged Odds Ratio Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications/*drug therapy Pregnancy Outcome Risk Scandinavia/epidemiology Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use Stillbirth/*epidemiology Young Adult"
23613074,Prenatal valproate exposure and risk of autism spectrum disorders and childhood autism.,JAMA,Christensen J and Gronborg TK and Sorensen MJ and Schendel D and Parner ET and Pedersen LH and Vestergaard M,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Valproate is used for the treatment of epilepsy and other neuropsychological disorders and may be the only treatment option for women of childbearing potential. However, prenatal exposure to valproate may increase the risk of autism. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prenatal exposure to valproate is associated with an increased risk of autism in offspring. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based study of all children born alive in Denmark from 1996 to 2006. National registers were used to identify children exposed to valproate during pregnancy and diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (childhood autism [autistic disorder], Asperger syndrome, atypical autism, and other or unspecified pervasive developmental disorders). We analyzed the risks associated with all autism spectrum disorders as well as childhood autism. Data were analyzed by Cox regression adjusting for potential confounders (maternal age at conception, paternal age at conception, parental psychiatric history, gestational age, birth weight, sex, congenital malformations, and parity). Children were followed up from birth until the day of autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, death, emigration, or December 31, 2010, whichever came first. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Absolute risk (cumulative incidence) and the hazard ratio (HR) of autism spectrum disorder and childhood autism in children after exposure to valproate in pregnancy. RESULTS: Of 655,615 children born from 1996 through 2006, 5437 were identified with autism spectrum disorder, including 2067 with childhood autism. The mean age of the children at end of follow-up was 8.84 years (range, 4-14; median, 8.85). The estimated absolute risk after 14 years of follow-up was 1.53% (95% CI, 1.47%-1.58%) for autism spectrum disorder and 0.48% (95% CI, 0.46%-0.51%) for childhood autism. Overall, the 508 children exposed to valproate had an absolute risk of 4.42% (95% CI, 2.59%-7.46%) for autism spectrum disorder (adjusted HR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.7-4.9]) and an absolute risk of 2.50% (95% CI, 1.30%-4.81%) for childhood autism (adjusted HR, 5.2 [95% CI, 2.7-10.0]). When restricting the cohort to the 6584 children born to women with epilepsy, the absolute risk of autism spectrum disorder among 432 children exposed to valproate was 4.15% (95% CI, 2.20%-7.81%) (adjusted HR, 1.7 [95% CI, 0.9-3.2]), and the absolute risk of childhood autism was 2.95% (95% CI, 1.42%-6.11%) (adjusted HR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.4-6.0]) vs 2.44% (95% CI, 1.88%-3.16%) for autism spectrum disorder and 1.02% (95% CI, 0.70%-1.49%) for childhood autism among 6152 children not exposed to valproate. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Maternal use of valproate during pregnancy was associated with a significantly increased risk of autism spectrum disorder and childhood autism in the offspring, even after adjusting for maternal epilepsy. For women of childbearing potential who use antiepileptic medications, these findings must be balanced against the treatment benefits for women who require valproate for epilepsy control.","Adolescent Adult Anticonvulsants/*adverse effects/therapeutic use Autistic Disorder/*epidemiology Child Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/*epidemiology Child, Preschool Denmark/epidemiology Epilepsy/*drug therapy Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Male Maternal Age Mental Disorders/epidemiology Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications/*drug therapy *Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects Registries/statistics & numerical data Risk Valproic Acid/*adverse effects/therapeutic use Young Adult"
23613075,Association of perioperative beta-blockade with mortality and cardiovascular morbidity following major noncardiac surgery.,JAMA,London MJ and Hur K and Schwartz GG and Henderson WG,ucsf,"IMPORTANCE: The effectiveness of perioperative beta-blockade in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations of early perioperative exposure to beta-blockers with 30-day postoperative outcome in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A retrospective cohort analysis evaluating exposure to beta-blockers on the day of or following major noncardiac surgery among a population-based sample of 136,745 patients who were 1:1 matched on propensity scores (37,805 matched pairs) treated at 104 VA medical centers from January 2005 through August 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All cause 30-day mortality and cardiac morbidity (cardiac arrest or Q-wave myocardial infarction). RESULTS: Overall 55,138 patients (40.3%) were exposed to beta-blockers. Exposure was higher in the 66.7% of 13,863 patients undergoing vascular surgery (95% CI, 65.9%-67.5%) than in the 37.4% of 122,882 patients undergoing nonvascular surgery (95% CI, 37.1%-37.6%; P < .001). Exposure increased as Revised Cardiac Risk Index factors increased, with 25.3% (95% CI, 24.9%-25.6%) of those with no risk vs 71.3% (95% CI, 69.5%-73.2%) of those with 4 risk factors or more exposed to beta-blockers (P < .001). Death occurred among 1.1% (95% CI, 1.1%-1.2%) and cardiac morbidity occurred among 0.9% (95% CI, 0.8%-0.9%) of patients. In the propensity matched cohort, exposure was associated with lower mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.65-0.83; P < .001; number need to treat [NNT], 241; 95% CI, 173-397). When stratified by cumulative numbers of Revised Cardiac Risk Index factors, beta-blocker exposure was associated with significantly lower mortality among patients with 2 factors (RR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.50-0.80]; P < .001; NNT, 105 [95% CI, 69-212]), 3 factors (RR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.39-0.73]; P < .001; NNT, 41 [95% CI, 28-80]), or 4 factors or more (RR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.25-0.73]; P < .001; NNT, 18 [95% CI, 12-34]). This association was limited to patients undergoing nonvascular surgery. beta-Blocker exposure was also associated with a lower rate of nonfatal Q-wave infarction or cardiac arrest (RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.57-0.79]; P < .001; NNT, 339 [95% CI, 240-582]), again limited to patients undergoing nonvascular surgery. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among propensity-matched patients undergoing noncardiac, nonvascular surgery, perioperative beta-blocker exposure was associated with lower rates of 30-day all-cause mortality in patients with 2 or more Revised Cardiac Risk Index factors. Our findings support use of a cumulative number of Revised Cardiac Risk Index predictors in decision making regarding institution and continuation of perioperative beta-blockade. A multicenter randomized trial involving patients at a low to intermediate risk by these factors would be of interest to validate these observational findings.","Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/*therapeutic use Aged Cohort Studies Databases, Factual Female Heart Arrest/*mortality/prevention & control Humans Male Middle Aged Morbidity Myocardial Infarction/*mortality/prevention & control Perioperative Period Retrospective Studies Risk *Surgical Procedures, Operative Treatment Outcome United States/epidemiology United States Department of Veterans Affairs/statistics & numerical data"

It is unclear whether anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy elevates herpes zoster risk. OBJECTIVES: To ascertain whether initiation of anti-TNF therapy compared with nonbiologic comparators is associated with increased herpes zoster risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We identified new users of anti-TNF therapy among cohorts of patients with RA, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis from 1998 through 2007 within a large US multi-institutional collaboration combining data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly, Tennessee Medicaid, and national Medicaid/Medicare programs. We compared herpes zoster incidence between new anti-TNF users (n=33,324) and patients initiating nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (n=25,742) within each inflammatory disease cohort (last participant follow-up December 31, 2007). Within these cohorts, we used Cox regression models to compare propensity score-adjusted herpes zoster incidence between new anti-TNF and nonbiologic DMARD users while controlling for baseline corticosteroid use. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of herpes zoster cases occurring after initiation of new anti-TNF or nonbiologic DMARD therapy. RESULTS: Among 33,324 new users of anti-TNF therapy, we identified 310 herpes zoster cases. Crude incidence rates among anti-TNF users were 12.1 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI, 10.7-13.6) for RA, 11.3 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI, 7.7-16.7) for inflammatory bowel disease, and 4.4 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI, 2.8-7.0) for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis. Baseline use of corticosteroids of 10 mg/d or greater among all disease indications was associated with elevated risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.13 [95% CI, 1.64-2.75]) compared with no baseline use. For patients with RA, adjusted incidence rates were similar between anti-TNF and nonbiologic DMARD initiators (adjusted HR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.77-1.29]) and comparable between all 3 anti-TNF therapies studied. Across all disease indications, the adjusted HR was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.88-1.36). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with RA and other inflammatory diseases, those who initiated anti-TNF therapies were not at higher risk of herpes zoster compared with patients who initiated nonbiologic treatment regimens.","Adult Aged Antirheumatic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use Arthritis, Rheumatoid/complications/*drug therapy/immunology Autoimmune Diseases/complications/*drug therapy/immunology Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies Databases, Factual Female Herpes Zoster/chemically induced/*epidemiology/immunology Humans Immunocompromised Host Incidence Male Middle Aged Retrospective Studies Risk Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors United States/epidemiology"

The effect of implementing these guidelines is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of a decision-support guide and elimination of financial barriers to testing on use of prenatal genetic testing and decision making among pregnant women of varying literacy and numeracy levels. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized trial conducted from 2010-2013 at prenatal clinics at 3 county hospitals, 1 community clinic, 1 academic center, and 3 medical centers of an integrated health care delivery system in the San Francisco Bay area. Participants were English- or Spanish-speaking women who had not yet undergone screening or diagnostic testing and remained pregnant at 11 weeks' gestation (n = 710). INTERVENTIONS: A computerized, interactive decision-support guide and access to prenatal testing with no out-of-pocket expense (n = 357) or usual care as per current guidelines (n = 353). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was invasive diagnostic test use, obtained via medical record review. Secondary outcomes included testing strategy undergone, and knowledge about testing, risk comprehension, and decisional conflict and regret at 24 to 36 weeks' gestation. RESULTS: Women randomized to the intervention group, compared with those randomized to the control group, were less likely to have invasive diagnostic testing (5.9% vs 12.3%; odds ratio [OR], 0.45 [95% CI, 0.25-0.80]) and more likely to forgo testing altogether (25.6% vs 20.4%; OR, 3.30 [95% CI, 1.43-7.64], reference group screening followed by invasive testing). Women randomized to the intervention group also had higher knowledge scores (9.4 vs 8.6 on a 15-point scale; mean group difference, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.34-1.31]) and were more likely to correctly estimate the amniocentesis-related miscarriage risk (73.8% vs 59.0%; OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.39-2.75]) and their estimated age-adjusted chance of carrying a fetus with trisomy 21 (58.7% vs 46.1%; OR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.22-2.28]). Significant differences did not emerge in decisional conflict or regret. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Full implementation of prenatal testing guidelines using a computerized, interactive decision-support guide in the absence of financial barriers to testing resulted in less test use and more informed choices. If validated in additional populations, this approach may result in more informed and preference-based prenatal testing decision making and fewer women undergoing testing.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if RBCs stored for 7 days or less compared with usual standards decreased rates of major nosocomial infection and organ dysfunction in neonatal intensive care unit patients requiring at least 1 RBC transfusion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 377 premature infants with birth weights less than 1250 g admitted to 6 Canadian tertiary neonatal intensive care units between May 2006 and June 2011. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive transfusion of RBCs stored 7 days or less (n = 188) vs standard-issue RBCs in accordance with standard blood bank practice (n = 189). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite measure of major neonatal morbidities, including necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and intraventricular hemorrhage, as well as death. The primary outcome was measured within the entire period of neonatal intensive care unit stay up to 90 days after randomization. The rate of nosocomial infection was a secondary outcome. RESULTS: The mean age of transfused blood was 5.1 (SD, 2.0) days in the fresh RBC group and 14.6 (SD, 8.3) days in the standard group. Among neonates in the fresh RBC group, 99 (52.7%) had the primary outcome compared with 100 (52.9%) in the standard RBC group (relative risk, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.82-1.21). The rate of clinically suspected infection in the fresh RBC group was 77.7% (n = 146) compared with 77.2% (n = 146) in the standard RBC group (relative risk, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.90-1.12), and the rate of positive cultures was 67.5% (n = 127) in the fresh RBC group compared with 64.0% (n = 121) in the standard RBC group (relative risk, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.91-1.22).

Meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model showed a decrease in lung injury development (risk ratio [RR], 0.33; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.47; I2, 0%; number needed to treat [NNT], 11), and mortality (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.89; I2, 0%; NNT, 23) in patients receiving ventilation with lower tidal volumes. The results of lung injury development were similar when stratified by the type of study (randomized vs nonrandomized) and were significant only in randomized trials for pulmonary infection and only in nonrandomized trials for mortality. Meta-analysis using a random-effects model showed, in protective ventilation groups, a lower incidence of pulmonary infection (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.92; I2, 32%; NNT, 26), lower mean (SD) hospital length of stay (6.91 [2.36] vs 8.87 [2.93] days, respectively; standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.82; I2, 75%), higher mean (SD) PaCO2 levels (41.05 [3.79] vs 37.90 [4.19] mm Hg, respectively; SMD, -0.51; 95% CI, -0.70 to -0.32; I2, 54%), and lower mean (SD) pH values (7.37 [0.03] vs 7.40 [0.04], respectively; SMD, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.31 to 2.02; I2, 96%) but similar mean (SD) ratios of PaO2 to fraction of inspired oxygen (304.40 [65.7] vs 312.97 [68.13], respectively; SMD, 0.11; 95% CI, -0.06 to 0.27; I2, 60%). Tidal volume gradients between the 2 groups did not influence significantly the final results. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients without ARDS, protective ventilation with lower tidal volumes was associated with better clinical outcomes. Some of the limitations of the meta-analysis were the mixed setting of mechanical ventilation (intensive care unit or operating room) and the duration of mechanical ventilation.","Humans Length of Stay Lung Diseases/*physiopathology/*therapy Lung Injury/*physiopathology/*therapy Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic *Respiration, Artificial Risk Tidal Volume Treatment Outcome"
25058085,"Anesthesia technique, mortality, and length of stay after hip fracture surgery.",JAMA,Neuman MD and Rosenbaum PR and Ludwig JM and Zubizarreta JR and Silber JH,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: More than 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the United States. Recent practice guidelines have advocated greater use of regional anesthesia for hip fracture surgery. OBJECTIVE: To test the association of regional (ie, spinal or epidural) anesthesia vs general anesthesia with 30-day mortality and hospital length of stay after hip fracture. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We conducted a matched retrospective cohort study involving patients 50 years or older who were undergoing surgery for hip fracture at general acute care hospitals in New York State between July 1, 2004, and December 31, 2011. Our main analysis was a near-far instrumental variable match that paired patients who lived at different distances from hospitals that specialized in regional or general anesthesia. Supplementary analyses included a within-hospital match that paired patients within the same hospital and an across-hospital match that paired patients at different hospitals. EXPOSURES: Spinal or epidural anesthesia; general anesthesia. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Thirty-day mortality and hospital length of stay. Because the distribution of length of stay had long tails, we characterized this outcome using the Huber M estimate with Huber weights, a robust estimator similar to a trimmed mean. RESULTS: Of 56,729 patients, 15,904 (28%) received regional anesthesia and 40,825 (72%) received general anesthesia. Overall, 3032 patients (5.3%) died. The M estimate of the length of stay was 6.2 days (95% CI, 6.2 to 6.2). The near-far matched analysis showed no significant difference in 30-day mortality by anesthesia type among the 21,514 patients included in this match: 583 of 10,757 matched patients (5.4%) who lived near a regional anesthesia-specialized hospital died vs 629 of 10,757 matched patients (5.8%) who lived near a general anesthesia-specialized hospital (instrumental variable estimate of risk difference, -1.1%; 95% CI, -2.8 to 0.5; P = .20). Supplementary analyses of within and across hospital patient matches yielded mortality findings to be similar to the main analysis. In the near-far match, regional anesthesia was associated with a 0.6-day shorter length of stay than general anesthesia (95% CI, -0.8 to -0.4, P < .001). Supplementary analyses also showed regional anesthesia to be associated with shorter length of stay, although the observed association was smaller in magnitude than in the main analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults in acute care hospitals in New York State undergoing hip repair, the use of regional anesthesia compared with general anesthesia was not associated with lower 30-day mortality but was associated with a modestly shorter length of stay. These findings do not support a mortality benefit for regional anesthesia in this setting.","Aged Aged, 80 and over *Anesthesia, Epidural *Anesthesia, General *Anesthesia, Spinal Cohort Studies Female Hip Fractures/*mortality/*surgery Hospitals/statistics & numerical data Humans Length of Stay Male New York Retrospective Studies Treatment Outcome"
23478662,Effect of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition on exercise capacity and clinical status in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Redfield MM and Chen HH and Borlaug BA and Semigran MJ and Lee KL and Lewis G and LeWinter MM and Rouleau JL and Bull DA and Mann DL and Deswal A and Stevenson LW and Givertz MM and Ofili EO and O'Connor CM and Felker GM and Goldsmith SR and Bart BA and McNulty SE and Ibarra JC and Lin G and Oh JK and Patel MR and Kim RJ and Tracy RP and Velazquez EJ and Anstrom KJ and Hernandez AF and Mascette AM and Braunwald E,mayo,"IMPORTANCE: Studies in experimental and human heart failure suggest that phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors may enhance cardiovascular function and thus exercise capacity in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil compared with placebo on exercise capacity and clinical status in HFPEF. DESIGN: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial of 216 stable outpatients with HF, ejection fraction >/=50%, elevated N-terminal brain-type natriuretic peptide or elevated invasively measured filling pressures, and reduced exercise capacity. Participants were randomized from October 2008 through February 2012 at 26 centers in North America. Follow-up was through August 30, 2012. INTERVENTIONS: Sildenafil (n = 113) or placebo (n = 103) administered orally at 20 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks, followed by 60 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end point was change in peak oxygen consumption after 24 weeks of therapy. Secondary end points included change in 6-minute walk distance and a hierarchical composite clinical status score (range, 1-n, a higher value indicates better status; expected value with no treatment effect, 95) based on time to death, time to cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization, and change in quality of life for participants without cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization at 24 weeks. RESULTS: Median age was 69 years, and 48% of patients were women. At baseline, median peak oxygen consumption (11.7 mL/kg/min) and 6-minute walk distance (308 m) were reduced. The median E/e' (16), left atrial volume index (44 mL/m2), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (41 mm Hg) were consistent with chronically elevated left ventricular filling pressures. At 24 weeks, median (IQR) changes in peak oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min) in patients who received placebo (-0.20 [IQR, -0.70 to 1.00]) or sildenafil (-0.20 [IQR, -1.70 to 1.11]) were not significantly different (P = .90) in analyses in which patients with missing week-24 data were excluded, and in sensitivity analysis based on intention to treat with multiple imputation for missing values (mean between-group difference, 0.01 mL/kg/min, [95% CI, -0.60 to 0.61]). The mean clinical status rank score was not significantly different at 24 weeks between placebo (95.8) and sildenafil (94.2) (P = .85). Changes in 6-minute walk distance at 24 weeks in patients who received placebo (15.0 m [IQR, -26.0 to 45.0]) or sildenafil (5.0 m [IQR, -37.0 to 55.0]; P = .92) were also not significantly different. Adverse events occurred in 78 placebo patients (76%) and 90 sildenafil patients (80%). Serious adverse events occurred in 16 placebo patients (16%) and 25 sildenafil patients (22%). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with HFPEF, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition with administration of sildenafil for 24 weeks, compared with placebo, did not result in significant improvement in exercise capacity or clinical status.

23754458,Stimulant medication and substance use outcomes: a meta-analysis.,JAMA Psychiatry,Humphreys KL and Eng T and Lee SS,ucla,"IMPORTANCE: Psychostimulant medication is an efficacious treatment for childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, yet controversy remains regarding potential iatrogenic effects of stimulant medication, particularly with respect to increasing susceptibility to later substance use disorders. However, stimulant treatment was previously reported to reduce the risk of substance problems. OBJECTIVE: To meta-analyze the longitudinal association between treatment with stimulant medication during childhood and later substance outcomes (ie, lifetime substance use and substance abuse or dependence). DATA SOURCES: Studies published between January 1980 and February 2012 were identified using review articles, PubMed, and pertinent listservs. STUDY SELECTION: Studies with longitudinal designs in which medication treatment preceded the measurement of substance outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Odds ratios were extracted or provided by the study authors. Odds ratios were obtained for lifetime use (ever used) and abuse or dependence status for alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, nicotine, and nonspecific drugs for 2565 participants from 15 different studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Random-effects models estimated the overall association, and potential study moderators were examined. RESULTS: Separate random-effects analyses were conducted for each substance outcome, with the number of studies ranging from 3 to 11 for each outcome. Results suggested comparable outcomes between children with and without medication treatment history for any substance use and abuse or dependence outcome across all substance types. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide an important update and suggest that treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with stimulant medication neither protects nor increases the risk of later substance use disorders.",Adolescent Adult Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/complications/drug therapy Central Nervous System Stimulants/*adverse effects/therapeutic use Child Female Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Odds Ratio Substance-Related Disorders/*complications/*epidemiology

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exposed to TNF-alpha antagonists were at increased risk of developing cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Nationwide register-based cohort study in Denmark, 1999-2012. Participants were 56,146 patients 15 years or older with IBD identified in the National Patient Registry, of whom 4553 (8.1%) were exposed to TNF-alpha antagonists. Cancer cases were identified in the Danish Cancer Registry. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rate ratios (RRs) for incident cancer (overall and site-specific) comparing TNF-alpha antagonist users and nonusers, estimated using Poisson regression adjusted for age, calendar year, disease duration, propensity scores, and use of other IBD medications. RESULTS: During 489,433 person-years of follow-up (median, 9.3 years [interquartile range, 4.2-14.0]), 81 of 4553 patients exposed to TNF-alpha antagonists (1.8%) (median follow-up, 3.7 years [interquartile range, 1.8-6.0]) and 3465 of 51,593 unexposed patients (6.7%) developed cancer, yielding a fully adjusted RR of 1.07 (95% CI, 0.85-1.36). There was no significantly increased risk of cancer in analyses according to time since first TNF-alpha antagonist exposure (less than 1 year: RR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.67-1.81]; 1 to less than 2 years: RR, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.77-1.93]; 2 to less than 5 years: RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.54-1.24]; 5 or more years: RR, 1.33 [95% CI, 0.88-2.03]) and in analyses according to the number of TNF-alpha antagonist doses received (1 to 3 doses: RR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.71-1.47]; 4 to 7 doses: RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.55-1.42]; 8 or more doses: RR, 1.29 [95% CI, 0.90-1.85]). No site-specific cancers were in significant excess in fully adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this Danish nationwide study, exposure to TNF-alpha antagonists among patients with IBD was not associated with an increased risk of cancer over a median follow-up of 3.7 years among those exposed. An increased risk associated with longer-term accumulated doses and follow-up cannot be excluded.",Adult Cohort Studies Denmark Female Humans Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/*drug therapy Male Middle Aged Neoplasms/*epidemiology Registries Risk Risk Factors Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors Young Adult
24643601,Age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff levels to rule out pulmonary embolism: the ADJUST-PE study.,JAMA,Righini M and Van Es J and Den Exter PL and Roy PM and Verschuren F and Ghuysen A and Rutschmann OT and Sanchez O and Jaffrelot M and Trinh-Duc A and Le Gall C and Moustafa F and Principe A and Van Houten AA and Ten Wolde M and Douma RA and Hazelaar G and Erkens PM and Van Kralingen KW and Grootenboers MJ and Durian MF and Cheung YW and Meyer G and Bounameaux H and Huisman MV and Kamphuisen PW and Le Gal G,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: D-dimer measurement is an important step in the diagnostic strategy of clinically suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE), but its clinical usefulness is limited in elderly patients. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively validate whether an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff, defined as age x 10 in patients 50 years or older, is associated with an increased diagnostic yield of D-dimer in elderly patients with suspected PE. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PATIENTS: A multicenter, multinational, prospective management outcome study in 19 centers in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland between January 1, 2010, and February 28, 2013. INTERVENTIONS: All consecutive outpatients who presented to the emergency department with clinically suspected PE were assessed by a sequential diagnostic strategy based on the clinical probability assessed using either the simplified, revised Geneva score or the 2-level Wells score for PE; highly sensitive D-dimer measurement; and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Patients with a D-dimer value between the conventional cutoff of 500 microg/L and their age-adjusted cutoff did not undergo CTPA and were left untreated and formally followed-up for a 3-month period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the failure rate of the diagnostic strategy, defined as adjudicated thromboembolic events during the 3-month follow-up period among patients not treated with anticoagulants on the basis of a negative age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff result. RESULTS: Of the 3346 patients with suspected PE included, the prevalence of PE was 19%. Among the 2898 patients with a nonhigh or an unlikely clinical probability, 817 patients (28.2%) had a D-dimer level lower than 500 microg/L (95% CI, 26.6%-29.9%) and 337 patients (11.6%) had a D-dimer between 500 microg/L and their age-adjusted cutoff (95% CI, 10.5%-12.9%). The 3-month failure rate in patients with a D-dimer level higher than 500 microg/L but below the age-adjusted cutoff was 1 of 331 patients (0.3% [95% CI, 0.1%-1.7%]). Among the 766 patients 75 years or older, of whom 673 had a nonhigh clinical probability, using the age-adjusted cutoff instead of the 500 microg/L cutoff increased the proportion of patients in whom PE could be excluded on the basis of D-dimer from 43 of 673 patients (6.4% [95% CI, 4.8%-8.5%) to 200 of 673 patients (29.7% [95% CI, 26.4%-33.3%), without any additional false-negative findings. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with a fixed D-dimer cutoff of 500 microg/L, the combination of pretest clinical probability assessment with age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff was associated with a larger number of patients in whom PE could be considered ruled out with a low likelihood of subsequent clinical venous thromboembolism.

24048217,Expansion of screening mammography in the Veterans Health Administration: implications for breast cancer treatment.,JAMA Surg,Kvasnovsky CL and Kesmodel SB and Gragasin JL and Punnoose V and Johnson PA and Goel R and Reddy SK and Pierson RN and Jain A,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Women represent the fastest-growing demographic in the Veterans Health Administration. In 2008, we implemented programmatic changes to expand screening mammography, develop on-site breast care resources, and better coordinate care with non-Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the programmatic changes would increase patient volumes, decrease time to definitive treatment, and increase the rate of breast conservation therapy (BCT). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all breast cancer cases treated from January 1, 2000, to May 31, 2012, at the Baltimore VA Medical Center. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We compared process-of-care metrics before and after 2008, when programmatic changes were implemented. Metrics evaluated included the number of mammograms performed annually, sex shift, the interval from clinical suspicion to tissue diagnosis and definitive treatment, and the rate of BCT. RESULTS: From 2000 to 2012, a total of 7355 mammograms were performed and 76 patients with breast cancer received treatment. Most mammograms (n = 6720) were performed after 2008. A median of 1453 (interquartile range [IQR], 592-1458) mammograms were performed and 6.33 patients received cancer treatment annually after 2008, representing 1200% and 49% increases, respectively, compared with the 2000 to 2007 interval. Most patients (86.7%) received screening and diagnostic imaging, biopsy, and surgery between multiple institutions. The interval between screening mammography and tissue diagnosis was 34 days (IQR, 20-52), with no significant difference between study intervals (P = .18). Time from tissue diagnosis to initiation of definitive treatment increased from 33 days (IQR, 26-51) to 51 days (IQR, 36-75) (P = .03) between 2008 and 2012. Thirty-three patients eligible for BCT (67.3%) received it, while 16 patients (32.7%) underwent mastectomy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our institution has rapidly and successfully expanded screening mammography. Higher mammography volumes have been associated with increased use of non-VA breast care services and increased time to definitive treatment. Appropriate counseling regarding BCT was consistently documented, and mastectomy in BCT-eligible patients was largely the result of patient preference or clinical/social factors. Our data suggest that as patient volumes increase with intensified screening, VA hospitals may benefit from acquiring a full complement of on-site breast care services rather than improving flow between VA hospitals and non-VA breast care centers having specialized resources.","Adult Aged Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*therapy *Early Detection of Cancer Female Hospitals, Veterans Humans Male Mammography/*utilization Mass Screening/organization & administration Mastectomy Middle Aged Retrospective Studies Time Factors *Veterans Health"
25005652,Efficacy of varenicline combined with nicotine replacement therapy vs varenicline alone for smoking cessation: a randomized clinical trial.,JAMA,Koegelenberg CF and Noor F and Bateman ED and van Zyl-Smit RN and Bruning A and O'Brien JA and Smith C and Abdool-Gaffar MS and Emanuel S and Esterhuizen TM and Irusen EM,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Behavioral approaches and pharmacotherapy are of proven benefit in assisting smokers to quit, but it is unclear whether combining nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) with varenicline to improve abstinence is effective and safe. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining varenicline and a nicotine patch vs varenicline alone in smoking cessation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial with a 12-week treatment period and a further 12-week follow-up conducted in 7 centers in South Africa from April 2011 to October 2012. Four hundred forty-six generally healthy smokers were randomized (1:1); 435 were included in the efficacy and safety analyses. INTERVENTIONS: Nicotine or placebo patch treatment began 2 weeks before a target quit date (TQD) and continued for a further 12 weeks. Varenicline was begun 1 week prior to TQD, continued for a further 12 weeks, and tapered off during week 13. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Tobacco abstinence was established and confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide measurements at TQD and at intervals thereafter up to 24 weeks. The primary end point was the 4-week exhaled carbon monoxide-confirmed continuous abstinence rate for weeks 9 through 12 of treatment, ie, the proportion of participants able to maintain complete abstinence from smoking for the last 4 weeks of treatment, as assessed using multiple imputation analysis. Secondary end points included point prevalence abstinence at 6 months, continuous abstinence rate from weeks 9 through 24, and adverse events. Multiple imputation also was used to address loss to follow-up. RESULTS: The combination treatment was associated with a higher continuous abstinence rate at 12 weeks (55.4% vs 40.9%; odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.19-2.89; P = .007) and 24 weeks (49.0% vs 32.6%; OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.25-3.14; P = .004) and point prevalence abstinence rate at 6 months (65.1% vs 46.7%; OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.32-3.43; P = .002). In the combination treatment group, there was a numerically greater incidence of nausea, sleep disturbance, skin reactions, constipation, and depression, with only skin reactions reaching statistical significance (14.4% vs 7.8%; P = .03); the varenicline-alone group experienced more abnormal dreams and headaches. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Varenicline in combination with NRT was more effective than varenicline alone at achieving tobacco abstinence at 12 weeks (end of treatment) and at 6 months. Further studies are needed to assess long-term efficacy and safety.

OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials and observational studies that have examined the association between vegetarian diets and BP. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched for articles published in English from 1946 to October 2013 and from 1900 to November 2013, respectively. STUDY SELECTION All studies met the inclusion criteria of the use of (1) participants older than 20 years, (2) vegetarian diets as an exposure or intervention, (3) mean difference in BP as an outcome, and (4) a controlled trial or observational study design. In addition, none met the exclusion criteria of (1) use of twin participants, (2) use of multiple interventions, (3) reporting only categorical BP data, or (4) reliance on case series or case reports. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data collected included study design, baseline characteristics of the study population, dietary data, and outcomes. The data were pooled using a random-effects model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Net differences in systolic and diastolic BP associated with the consumption of vegetarian diets were assessed. RESULTS Of the 258 studies identified, 7 clinical trials and 32 observational studies met the inclusion criteria. In the 7 controlled trials (a total of 311 participants; mean age, 44.5 years), consumption of vegetarian diets was associated with a reduction in mean systolic BP (-4.8 mm Hg; 95% CI, -6.6 to -3.1; P < .001; I2 = 0; P = .45 for heterogeneity) and diastolic BP (-2.2 mm Hg; 95% CI, -3.5 to -1.0; P < .001; I2 = 0; P = .43 for heterogeneity) compared with the consumption of omnivorous diets. In the 32 observational studies (a total of 21,604 participants; mean age, 46.6 years), consumption of vegetarian diets was associated with lower mean systolic BP (-6.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, -9.1 to -4.7; P < .001; I2 = 91.4; P < .001 for heterogeneity) and diastolic BP (-4.7 mm Hg; 95% CI, -6.3 to -3.1; P < .001; I2 = 92.6; P < .001 for heterogeneity) compared with the consumption of omnivorous diets. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Consumption of vegetarian diets is associated with lower BP. Such diets could be a useful nonpharmacologic means for reducing BP.","Blood Pressure/*physiology *Diet, Vegetarian Humans Hypertension/*diet therapy"

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between vegetarian dietary patterns and mortality. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study; mortality analysis by Cox proportional hazards regression, controlling for important demographic and lifestyle confounders. SETTING: Adventist Health Study 2 (AHS-2), a large North American cohort. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 96,469 Seventh-day Adventist men and women recruited between 2002 and 2007, from which an analytic sample of 73,308 participants remained after exclusions. EXPOSURES: Diet was assessed at baseline by a quantitative food frequency questionnaire and categorized into 5 dietary patterns: nonvegetarian, semi-vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, lacto-ovo-vegetarian, and vegan. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The relationship between vegetarian dietary patterns and all-cause and cause-specific mortality; deaths through 2009 were identified from the National Death Index. RESULTS: There were 2570 deaths among 73,308 participants during a mean follow-up time of 5.79 years. The mortality rate was 6.05 (95% CI, 5.82-6.29) deaths per 1000 person-years. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality in all vegetarians combined vs nonvegetarians was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80-0.97). The adjusted HR for all-cause mortality in vegans was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73-1.01); in lacto-ovo-vegetarians, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.82-1.00); in pesco-vegetarians, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.69-0.94); and in semi-vegetarians, 0.92 (95% CI, 0.75-1.13) compared with nonvegetarians. Significant associations with vegetarian diets were detected for cardiovascular mortality, noncardiovascular noncancer mortality, renal mortality, and endocrine mortality. Associations in men were larger and more often significant than were those in women. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vegetarian diets are associated with lower all-cause mortality and with some reductions in cause-specific mortality. Results appeared to be more robust in males. These favorable associations should be considered carefully by those offering dietary guidance.","Adult Aged Body Mass Index *Cause of Death Cohort Studies Diet/statistics & numerical data Diet, Vegetarian/*statistics & numerical data Female Follow-Up Studies Humans *Life Style Male Middle Aged Myocardial Ischemia/epidemiology Neoplasms/epidemiology North America/epidemiology Nutritional Status Prospective Studies *Protestantism Sampling Studies"

Between June 1 and August 31, 2008, men were recruited, completed baseline telephone interviews, and were than randomized to receive either a video-based intervention (n = 469) or brochures only (n = 461; overall response rate, 37.1%) and were again interviewed 7 months later (n = 870; 93.5% retention). INTERVENTIONS: Video on skin self-examination and skin awareness and written informational materials. The control group received written materials only.

Physicians completed a case report form that included the type of CSE, who initiated it, the number of suspicious lesions detected, how lesions were managed (excision, nonsurgical treatment, monitoring, or referral), and pathology reports after lesion excision or biopsy. RESULTS: Overall, 540 of 870 men (62.1%) self-reported a CSE since receiving intervention materials, and 321 of 540 (59.4%) consented for their physician to provide medical information (received for 266 of 321 [82.9%]). Attendance of any CSE was similar between groups (intervention group, 246 of 436 [56.4%]; control group, 229 of 434 [52.8%]), but men in the intervention group were more likely to self-report a whole-body CSE (154 of 436 [35.3%] vs 118 of 434 [27.2%] for control group; P = .01). Two melanomas, 29 squamous cell carcinomas, and 38 basal cell carcinomas were diagnosed, with a higher proportion of malignant lesions in the intervention group (60.0% vs 40.0% for controls; P = .03). Baseline attitudes, behaviors, and skin cancer history were associated with higher odds of CSE and skin cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A video-based intervention may increase whole-body CSE and skin cancer diagnosis in older men.

23047359,Association between physical activity and risk of bleeding in children with hemophilia.,JAMA,Broderick CR and Herbert RD and Latimer J and Barnes C and Curtin JA and Mathieu E and Monagle P and Brown SA,unsw,"CONTEXT: Vigorous physical activity is thought to increase risk of bleeds in children with hemophilia, but the magnitude of the risk is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the transient increase in risk of bleeds associated with physical activity in children with hemophilia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A case-crossover study nested within a prospective cohort study was conducted at 3 pediatric hemophilia centers in Australia between July 2008 and October 2010. A total of 104 children and adolescent boys aged 4 through 18 years with moderate or severe hemophilia A or B were monitored for bleeds for up to 1 year. Following each bleed, the child or parent was interviewed to ascertain exposures to physical activity preceding the bleed. Physical activity was categorized according to expected frequency and severity of collisions. The risk of bleeds associated with physical activity was estimated by contrasting exposure to physical activity in the 8 hours before the bleed with exposures in two 8-hour control windows, controlling for levels of clotting factor in the blood. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association of physical activity and factor level with risk of bleeding. RESULTS: The participants were observed for 4839 person-weeks during which time 436 bleeds occurred. Of these, 336 bleeds occurred more than 2 weeks after the preceding bleed and were used in the primary analysis of risk. Compared with inactivity and category 1 activities (eg, swimming), category 2 activities (eg, basketball) were associated with a transient increase in the risk of bleeding (30.6% of bleed windows vs 24.8% of first control windows; odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.7-4.8, P < .001). Category 3 activities (eg, wrestling) were associated with a greater transient increase in risk (7.0% of bleed windows vs 3.4% of first control windows; odds ratio, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.3-7.3, P < .001). To illustrate absolute risk increase, for a child who bleeds 5 times annually and is exposed on average to category 2 activities twice weekly and to category 3 activities once weekly, exposure to these activities was associated with only 1 of the 5 annual bleeds. For every 1% increase in clotting factor level, bleeding incidence was lower by 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: In children and adolescents with hemophilia, vigorous physical activity was transiently associated with a moderate relative increase in risk of bleeding. Because the increased relative risk is transient, the absolute increase in risk of bleeds associated with physical activity is likely to be small.","Adolescent Australia/epidemiology Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Cross-Over Studies *Exercise Female Hemophilia A/*complications Hemophilia B/*complications Hemorrhage/*epidemiology/etiology Humans Male Risk Severity of Illness Index"

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cognitive and/or emotional variables mediate the effect of violent video game play on aggression and whether the effect is moderated by age, sex, prior aggressiveness, or parental monitoring. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Three-year longitudinal panel study. A total of 3034 children and adolescents from 6 primary and 6 secondary schools in Singapore (73% male) were surveyed annually. Children were eligible for inclusion if they attended one of the 12 selected schools, 3 of which were boys' schools. At the beginning of the study, participants were in third, fourth, seventh, and eighth grades, with a mean (SD) age of 11.2 (2.1) years (range, 8-17 years). Study participation was 99% in year 1. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The final outcome measure was aggressive behavior, with aggressive cognitions (normative beliefs about aggression, hostile attribution bias, aggressive fantasizing) and empathy as potential mediators. RESULTS: Longitudinal latent growth curve modeling demonstrated that the effects of violent video game play are mediated primarily by aggressive cognitions. This effect is not moderated by sex, prior aggressiveness, or parental monitoring and is only slightly moderated by age, as younger children had a larger increase in initial aggressive cognition related to initial violent game play at the beginning of the study than older children. Model fit was excellent for all models. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Given that more than 90% of youths play video games, understanding the psychological mechanisms by which they can influence behaviors is important for parents and pediatricians and for designing interventions to enhance or mitigate the effects.",Adolescent Aggression/*psychology Child *Cognition *Emotions Female Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Risk Factors Singapore Time Factors Video Games/*psychology Violence/*psychology

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), a marker of vitamin D status, predict disease activity and prognosis in patients with a first event suggestive of MS (clinically isolated syndrome). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Betaferon/Betaseron in Newly Emerging multiple sclerosis For Initial Treatment study was a randomized trial originally designed to evaluate the impact of early vs delayed interferon beta-1b treatment in patients with clinically isolated syndrome. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. A total of 465 of the 468 patients randomized had at least 1 25(OH)D measurement, and 334 patients had them at both the 6- and 12-month (seasonally asynchronous) measurements. Patients were followed up for 5 years clinically and by magnetic resonance imaging. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: New active lesions, increased T2 lesion volume, and brain volume on magnetic resonance imaging, as well as MS relapses and disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale score). RESULTS: Higher 25(OH)D levels predicted reduced MS activity and a slower rate of progression. A 50-nmol/L (20-ng/mL) increment in average serum 25(OH)D levels within the first 12 months predicted a 57% lower rate of new active lesions (P < .001), 57% lower relapse rate (P = .03), 25% lower yearly increase in T2 lesion volume (P < .001), and 0.41% lower yearly loss in brain volume (P = .07) from months 12 to 60. Similar associations were found between 25(OH)D measured up to 12 months and MS activity or progression from months 24 to 60. In analyses using dichotomous 25(OH)D levels, values greater than or equal to 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) at up to 12 months predicted lower disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale score, -0.17; P = .004) during the subsequent 4 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with MS mainly treated with interferon beta-1b, low 25(OH)D levels early in the disease course are a strong risk factor for long-term MS activity and progression.",Adult Biological Markers/blood Demyelinating Diseases/*blood/drug therapy/pathology Disease Progression Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Multiple Sclerosis/*blood/drug therapy/pathology Predictive Value of Tests Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Recurrence Risk Factors Time Factors Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/blood

No clinical trial has yet examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation in isolated systolic hypertension, the most common pattern of hypertension in older people. OBJECTIVE: To test whether high-dose, intermittent cholecalciferol supplementation lowers blood pressure in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension. DESIGN: Parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial. SETTING: Primary care clinics and hospital clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Patients 70 years and older with isolated systolic hypertension (supine systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg and supine diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) and baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL were randomized into the trial from June 1, 2009, through May 31, 2011. INTERVENTIONS: A total of 100,000 U of oral cholecalciferol or matching placebo every 3 months for 1 year. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Difference in office blood pressure, 24-hour blood pressure, arterial stiffness, endothelial function, cholesterol level, insulin resistance, and b-type natriuretic peptide level during 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 159 participants were randomized (mean age, 77 years). Mean baseline office systolic blood pressure was 163/78 mm Hg. Mean baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 18 ng/mL. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D levels increased in the treatment group compared with the placebo group (+8 ng/mL at 1 year, P < .001). No significant treatment effect was seen for mean (95% CI) office blood pressure (-1 [-6 to 4]/-2 [-4 to 1] mm Hg at 3 months and 1 [-2 to 4]/0 [-2 to 2] mm Hg overall treatment effect).

It is not known if supplementing inhaled corticosteroids with oral vitamin D3 improves outcomes in patients with asthma and vitamin D insufficiency. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if vitamin D supplementation would improve the clinical efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with symptomatic asthma and lower vitamin D levels. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The VIDA (Vitamin D Add-on Therapy Enhances Corticosteroid Responsiveness in Asthma) randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial studying adult patients with symptomatic asthma and a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 30 ng/mL was conducted across 9 academic US medical centers in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's AsthmaNet network, with enrollment starting in April 2011 and follow-up complete by January 2014. After a run-in period that included treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid, 408 patients were randomized. INTERVENTIONS: Oral vitamin D3 (100,000 IU once, then 4000 IU/d for 28 weeks; n = 201) or placebo (n = 207) was added to inhaled ciclesonide (320 microg/d). If asthma control was achieved after 12 weeks, ciclesonide was tapered to 160 microg/d for 8 weeks, then to 80 microg/d for 8 weeks if asthma control was maintained. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to first asthma treatment failure (a composite outcome of decline in lung function and increases in use of beta-agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and health care). RESULTS: Treatment with vitamin D3 did not alter the rate of first treatment failure during 28 weeks (28% [95% CI, 21%-34%] with vitamin D3 vs 29% [95% CI, 23%-35%] with placebo; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.6-1.3]). Of 14 prespecified secondary outcomes, 9 were analyzed, including asthma exacerbation; of those 9, the only statistically significant outcome was a small difference in the overall dose of ciclesonide required to maintain asthma control (111.3 microg/d [95% CI, 102.2-120.4 microg/d] in the vitamin D3 group vs 126.2 microg/d [95% CI, 117.2-135.3 microg/d] in the placebo group; difference of 14.9 microg/d [95% CI, 2.1-27.7 microg/d]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vitamin D3 did not reduce the rate of first treatment failure or exacerbation in adults with persistent asthma and vitamin D insufficiency.

Some studies have suggested that vitamin D may protect against structural progression. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether vitamin D supplementation reduces symptom and structural progression of knee OA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A 2-year randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial involving 146 participants with symptomatic knee OA (mean age, 62.4 years [SD, 8.5]; 57 women [61%], 115 white race [79%]). Patients were enrolled at Tufts Medical Center in Boston between March 2006 and June 2009. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to receive either placebo or oral cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d, with dose escalation to elevate serum levels to more than 36 ng/mL. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were knee pain severity (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities [WOMAC] pain scale, 0-20: 0, no pain; 20, extreme pain), and cartilage volume loss measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary end points included physical function, knee function (WOMAC function scale, 0-68: 0, no difficulty; 68, extreme difficulty), cartilage thickness, bone marrow lesions, and radiographic joint space width. RESULTS: Eighty-five percent of the participants completed the study. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels increased by a mean 16.1 ng/mL (95% CI, 13.7 to 18.6) in the treatment group and by a mean 2.1 mg/mL (95% CI, 0.5 to 3.7) (P < .001) in the placebo group. Baseline knee pain was slightly worse in the treatment group (mean, 6.9; 95% CI, 6.0 to 7.7) than in the placebo group (mean, 5.8; 95% CI, 5.0 to 6.6) (P = .08). Baseline knee function was significantly worse in the treatment group (mean, 22.7; 95% CI, 19.8 to 25.6) than in the placebo group (mean, 18.5; 95% CI, 15.8 to 21.2) (P = .04). Knee pain decreased in both groups by a mean -2.31 (95% CI, -3.24 to -1.38) in the treatment group and -1.46 (95% CI, -2.33 to -0.60) in the placebo group, with no significant differences at any time. The percentage of cartilage volume decreased by the same extent in both groups (mean, -4.30; 95% CI, -5.48 to -3.12 vs mean, -4.25; 95% CI, -6.12 to -2.39) (P = .96). There were no differences in any of the secondary clinical end points. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Vitamin D supplementation for 2 years at a dose sufficient to elevate 25-hydroxyvitamin D plasma levels to higher than 36 ng/mL, when compared with placebo, did not reduce knee pain or cartilage volume loss in patients with symptomatic knee OA.

Systematic reviews suggest efficacy of web-based alcohol screening and brief intervention and call for effectiveness trials in settings where it could be sustainably delivered. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a national web-based alcohol screening and brief intervention program. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multisite, double-blind, parallel-group, individually randomized trial was conducted at 7 New Zealand universities. In April and May of 2010, invitations containing hyperlinks to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) screening test were e-mailed to 14,991 students aged 17 to 24 years. INTERVENTIONS: Participants who screened positive (AUDIT-C score >/=4) were randomized to undergo screening alone or to 10 minutes of assessment and feedback (including comparisons with medical guidelines and peer norms) on alcohol expenditure, peak blood alcohol concentration, alcohol dependence, and access to help and information. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A fully automated 5-month follow-up assessment was conducted that measured 6 primary outcomes: consumption per typical occasion, drinking frequency, volume of alcohol consumed, an academic problems score, and whether participants exceeded medical guidelines for acute harm (binge drinking) and chronic harm (heavy drinking). A Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of .0083 was used to account for the 6 comparisons and a sensitivity analysis was used to assess possible attrition bias. RESULTS: Of 5135 students screened, 3422 scored 4 or greater and were randomized, and 83% were followed up. There was a significant effect on 1 of the 6 prespecified outcomes. Relative to control participants, those who received intervention consumed less alcohol per typical drinking occasion (median 4 drinks [interquartile range {IQR}, 2-8] vs 5 drinks [IQR 2-8]; rate ratio [RR], 0.93 [99.17% CI, 0.86-1.00]; P = .005) but not less often (RR, 0.95 [99.17% CI, 0.88-1.03]; P = .08) or less overall (RR, 0.95 [99.17% CI, 0.81-1.10]; P = .33). Academic problem scores were not lower (RR, 0.91 [99.17% CI, 0.76-1.08]; P = .14) and effects on the risks of binge drinking (odds ratio [OR], 0.84 [99.17% CI, 0.67-1.05]; P = .04) and heavy drinking (OR, 0.77 [99.17% CI, 0.56-1.05]; P = .03) were not significantly significant. In a sensitivity analysis accounting for attrition, the effect on alcohol per typical drinking occasion was no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A national web-based alcohol screening and brief intervention program produced no significant reductions in the frequency or overall volume of drinking or academic problems. There remains a possibility of a small reduction in the amount of alcohol consumed per typical drinking occasion.

It is unknown whether weekend diagnostic admissions in pediatric patients with leukemia demonstrate similar adverse outcomes. Objective: To estimate adverse clinical outcomes associated with weekend admission in the first hospitalization of pediatric patients with newly diagnosed leukemia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study from 1999 to 2011 featured index hospital admissions identified from the Pediatric Health Information System database. Participants were children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoid leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. Exposures: Weekend (Saturday and Sunday) or weekday index admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Inpatient mortality, length of inpatient stay, time to chemotherapy, and organ-system failure in index admission. Results: A total of 10 720 patients with acute lymphoid leukemia and 1323 patients with acute myeloid leukemia were identified; 2009 patients (16.7%) were admitted on the weekend. While the total daily number of patients receiving intensive care unit-level care was constant regardless of the day of admission, these patients represented a larger percentage of total admissions on weekends. In adjusted analyses, patients admitted on the weekend did not have an increased rate of mortality during the first admission (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.6). Patients whose initial admission for leukemia occurred during a weekend had a significantly increased length of stay (1.4-day increase; 95% CI, 0.7-2.1), time to initiation of chemotherapy (0.36-day increase; 95% CI, 0.3-0.5), and risk for respiratory failure (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7) after adjusting for demographics, severity of illness, and hospital-level factors. Conclusions and Relevance: While pediatric patients with newly diagnosed leukemia admitted on weekends do not have higher mortality rates, they have a prolonged length of stay, increased time to chemotherapy, and higher risk for respiratory failure.

24898363,An electronic health records study of long-term weight gain following antidepressant use.,JAMA Psychiatry,Blumenthal SR and Castro VM and Clements CC and Rosenfield HR and Murphy SN and Fava M and Weilburg JB and Erb JL and Churchill SE and Kohane IS and Smoller JW and Perlis RH,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Short-term studies suggest antidepressants are associated with modest weight gain but little is known about longer-term effects and differences between individual medications in general clinical populations. OBJECTIVE: To estimate weight gain associated with specific antidepressants over the 12 months following initial prescription in a large and diverse clinical population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We identified 22,610 adult patients who began receiving a medication of interest with available weight data in a large New England health care system, including 2 academic medical centers and affiliated outpatient primary and specialty care clinics. We used electronic health records to extract prescribing data and recorded weights for any patient with an index antidepressant prescription including amitriptyline hydrochloride, bupropion hydrochloride, citalopram hydrobromide, duloxetine hydrochloride, escitalopram oxalate, fluoxetine hydrochloride, mirtazapine, nortriptyline hydrochloride, paroxetine hydrochloride, venlafaxine hydrochloride, and sertraline hydrochloride. As measures of assay sensitivity, additional index prescriptions examined included the antiasthma medication albuterol sulfate and the antiobesity medications orlistat, phentermine hydrochloride, and sibutramine hydrochloride. Mixed-effects models were used to estimate rate of weight change over 12 months in comparison with the reference antidepressant, citalopram. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Clinician-recorded weight at 3-month intervals up to 12 months. RESULTS: Compared with citalopram, in models adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical features, significantly decreased rate of weight gain was observed among individuals treated with bupropion (beta [SE]: -0.063 [0.027]; P = .02), amitriptyline (beta [SE]: -0.081 [0.025]; P = .001), and nortriptyline (beta [SE]: -0.147 [0.034]; P < .001). As anticipated, differences were less pronounced among individuals discontinuing treatment prior to 12 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Antidepressants differ modestly in their propensity to contribute to weight gain. Short-term investigations may be insufficient to characterize and differentiate this risk.",Missing
24744140,Analysis of Growth Curves in Children After Adenotonsillectomy.,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Czechowicz JA and Chang KW,Missing,"IMPORTANCE Several studies have documented that children gain more weight than expected after adenotonsillectomy. OBJECTIVES To examine patterns of change in weight and stature percentiles in children after adenotonsillectomy and to analyze clinical and demographic correlates of shifts in the growth curve. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this retrospective medical record review, we studied patients 18 years and younger who underwent adenotonsillectomy at an academic pediatric tertiary medical center and had at least one height and weight measurement recorded at each of the following time points: within 3 months before surgery, within 3 to 9 months after surgery, and within 12 to 27 months after surgery. Data were procured from all children from January 1, 2007, through October 31, 2012, and initially included 2893 surgical patients and 161 458 height and weight measurements. The final database consisted of 815 patients with adequate growth data and multiple time points. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine patient age at surgery, preoperative weight, sex, and ethnic background for correlations with changes in weight, height, and body mass index percentiles. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Change in weight, height, and body mass index percentile before and after surgery. RESULTS At 18 months after surgery, weight percentiles in the study group increased by a mean of 6.3 percentile points (P &lt; .001). Body mass index percentiles increased by a mean of 8.0 percentile points (P &lt; .001). The greatest increases in weight percentiles were observed in children who were between the 1st and 60th percentiles for weight (P &lt; .001) and younger than 4 years at the time of surgery (P &lt; .001). An increase in weight percentile was not observed in children who preoperatively were already above the 80th percentile in weight (P = .15). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Weight gain after adenotonsillectomy occurs primarily in patients who are smaller and younger at the time of surgery and does not correlate with increased rates of obesity.",Missing
23752669,Effect of weight loss on the severity of psoriasis: a randomized clinical study.,JAMA Dermatol,Jensen P and Zachariae C and Christensen R and Geiker NR and Schaadt BK and Stender S and Hansen PR and Astrup A and Skov L,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Psoriasis is associated with adiposity and weight gain increases the severity of psoriasis and the risk of incident psoriasis. Therefore, we aimed to measure the effect of weight reduction on the severity of psoriasis in obese patients with psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of weight reduction on the severity of psoriasis in overweight patients. DESIGN: Sixty obese patients with psoriasis from our dermatology outpatient clinic were enrolled in a prospective randomized clinical trial in which they were allocated to a control group or an intervention group. SETTING: University hospital outpatient dermatology clinic. PARTICIPANTS: We included 60 of 69 eligible overweight patients with psoriasis (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], 27-40; aged 25-71 years). INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group received a low-energy diet (LED) (800-1000 kcal/d) for 8 weeks to induce weight loss, followed by 8 weeks of reintroduction of normal food intake, reaching 1200 kcal/d. The control group was instructed to continue eating ordinary healthy foods. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) after 16 weeks, with Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) as a secondary end point. RESULTS: The median PASI for all patients was 5.4 (interquartile range, 3.8-7.6) at baseline. At week 16, the mean body weight loss was 15.4 kg (95% CI, 12.3-18.5 kg; P < .001) greater in the intervention group than in the control group. The corresponding mean differences in PASI and DLQI, also in favor of the LED group, were -2.0 (95% CI, 4.1 to -0.1; P = .06) and -2.0 (95% CI, -3.6 to -0.3; P = .02), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment with an LED showed a trend in favor of clinically important PASI improvement and a significant reduction in DLQI in overweight patients with psoriasis.

23560285,Substance use following bariatric weight loss surgery.,JAMA Surg,Conason A and Teixeira J and Hsu CH and Puma L and Knafo D and Geliebter A,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: To assess substance use before and after bariatric weight loss surgery (WLS). There is a paucity of research investigating the occurrence of substance use following bariatric WLS. It was hypothesized that patients who underwent WLS would exhibit an increase in substance use (drug use, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking) following surgery to compensate for a marked decrease in food intake. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: A major urban community hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 155 participants (132 women and 23 men) who underwent WLS were recruited from a preoperative information session at a bariatric surgery center. INTERVENTION: Participants received either laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (n = 100) or laparoscopic adjustable gastric band surgery (n = 55). Participants completed questionnaires to assess eating behaviors and substance use at preoperative baseline and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Substance use as assessed by the Compulsive Behaviors Questionnaire. RESULTS: Participants reported significant increases in the frequency of substance use (a composite of drug use, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking, hereafter referred to as composite substance use) 24 months after surgery. Specifically, participants experienced a significant increase in the frequency of composite substance use from baseline to 24 months after surgery (P = .02), as well as significant increases from 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months to 24 months after surgery (all P </= .002). In addition, participants who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery reported a significant increase in the frequency of alcohol use from baseline to 24 months after surgery (P = .011). The response rate to the survey was 61% at 1-month follow-up, 41% at 3-month follow-up, 43% at 6-month follow-up, 49% at 12-month follow-up, and 24% at 24-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients may be at increased risk for substance use following bariatric WLS. In particular, patients who undergo laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery may be at increased risk for alcohol use following WLS. Our study is among the first to document significant increases in substance use following WLS using longitudinal data.","Adolescent Adult Aged Bariatric Surgery/*methods Female Follow-Up Studies Humans *Laparoscopy Male Middle Aged Obesity, Morbid/*surgery Odds Ratio Postoperative Period Prevalence Prospective Studies Risk Factors Substance-Related Disorders/*epidemiology/etiology United States/epidemiology *Weight Loss Young Adult"
25058219,Use of whole-exome sequencing to determine the genetic basis of multiple mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies.,JAMA,Taylor RW and Pyle A and Griffin H and Blakely EL and Duff J and He L and Smertenko T and Alston CL and Neeve VC and Best A and Yarham JW and Kirschner J and Schara U and Talim B and Topaloglu H and Baric I and Holinski-Feder E and Abicht A and Czermin B and Kleinle S and Morris AA and Vassallo G and Gorman GS and Ramesh V and Turnbull DM and Santibanez-Koref M and McFarland R and Horvath R and Chinnery PF,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Mitochondrial disorders have emerged as a common cause of inherited disease, but their diagnosis remains challenging. Multiple respiratory chain complex defects are particularly difficult to diagnose at the molecular level because of the massive number of nuclear genes potentially involved in intramitochondrial protein synthesis, with many not yet linked to human disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine the molecular basis of multiple respiratory chain complex deficiencies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 53 patients referred to 2 national centers in the United Kingdom and Germany between 2005 and 2012. All had biochemical evidence of multiple respiratory chain complex defects but no primary pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutation. Whole-exome sequencing was performed using 62-Mb exome enrichment, followed by variant prioritization using bioinformatic prediction tools, variant validation by Sanger sequencing, and segregation of the variant with the disease phenotype in the family. RESULTS: Presumptive causal variants were identified in 28 patients (53%; 95% CI, 39%-67%) and possible causal variants were identified in 4 (8%; 95% CI, 2%-18%). Together these accounted for 32 patients (60% 95% CI, 46%-74%) and involved 18 different genes. These included recurrent mutations in RMND1, AARS2, and MTO1, each on a haplotype background consistent with a shared founder allele, and potential novel mutations in 4 possible mitochondrial disease genes (VARS2, GARS, FLAD1, and PTCD1). Distinguishing clinical features included deafness and renal involvement associated with RMND1 and cardiomyopathy with AARS2 and MTO1. However, atypical clinical features were present in some patients, including normal liver function and Leigh syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) seen in association with TRMU mutations and no cardiomyopathy with founder SCO2 mutations. It was not possible to confidently identify the underlying genetic basis in 21 patients (40%; 95% CI, 26%-54%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Exome sequencing enhances the ability to identify potential nuclear gene mutations in patients with biochemically defined defects affecting multiple mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. Additional study is required in independent patient populations to determine the utility of this approach in comparison with traditional diagnostic methods.","Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Computational Biology *DNA Mutational Analysis *Exome Female Haplotypes Humans Infant Male Mitochondrial Diseases/*diagnosis/*genetics Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods"
24449315,"Clinical trial evidence supporting FDA approval of novel therapeutic agents, 2005-2012.",JAMA,Downing NS and Aminawung JA and Shah ND and Krumholz HM and Ross JS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Many patients and physicians assume that the safety and effectiveness of newly approved therapeutic agents is well understood; however, the strength of the clinical trial evidence supporting approval decisions by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVES: To characterize pivotal efficacy trials (clinical trials that serve as the basis of FDA approval) for newly approved novel therapeutic agents. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional analysis using publicly available FDA documents for all novel therapeutic agents approved between 2005 and 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pivotal efficacy trials were classified according to the following design features: randomization, blinding, comparator, and trial end point. Surrogate outcomes were defined as any end point using a biomarker expected to predict clinical benefit. The number of patients, trial duration, and trial completion rates were also determined. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2012, the FDA approved 188 novel therapeutic agents for 206 indications on the basis of 448 pivotal efficacy trials. The median number of pivotal trials per indication was 2 (interquartile range, 1-2.5), although 74 indications (36.8%) were approved on the basis of a single pivotal trial. Nearly all trials were randomized (89.3% [95% CI, 86.4%-92.2%]), double-blinded (79.5% [95% CI, 75.7%-83.2%]), and used either an active or placebo comparator (87.1% [95% CI, 83.9%-90.2%]). The median number of patients enrolled per indication among all pivotal trials was 760 (interquartile range, 270-1550). At least 1 pivotal trial with a duration of 6 months or greater supported the approval of 68 indications (33.8% [95% CI, 27.2%-40.4%]). Pivotal trials using surrogate end points as their primary outcome formed the exclusive basis of approval for 91 indications (45.3% [95% CI, 38.3%-52.2%]), clinical outcomes for 67 (33.3% [95% CI, 26.8%-39.9%]), and clinical scales for 36 (17.9% [95% CI, 12.6%-23.3%]). Trial features differed by therapeutic and indication characteristics, such as therapeutic area, expected length of treatment, orphan status, and accelerated approval. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The quality of clinical trial evidence used by the FDA as the basis for recent approvals of novel therapeutic agents varied widely across indications. This variation has important implications for patients and physicians as they make decisions about the use of newly approved therapeutic agents.",Biological Markers Cross-Sectional Studies Decision Making *Drug Approval Endpoint Determination Pharmaceutical Preparations *Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic Research Design United States *United States Food and Drug Administration

Combining individual patient data from multiple clinical trials would enable assessment of CRT benefit in women. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether women with left bundle branch block (LBBB) benefit from CRT-defibrillators (CRT-D) at a shorter QRS duration than men with LBBB do. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Individual patient data were pooled from 3 CRT-D vs implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) trials (4076 patients) enrolling predominantly patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II heart failure and follow-up to 3 years. The effect of CRT-D compared with ICD on outcomes was assessed using random effects Cox proportional hazards. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Time to heart failure event or death (primary) and death alone (secondary). RESULTS: Women benefited from CRT-D more than men. The main difference occurred in patients with LBBB and a QRS of 130 to 149 milliseconds. In this group, women had a 76% reduction in heart failure or death (absolute CRT-D to ICD difference, 23%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.24, [95% CI, 0.11-0.53]; P < .001) and a 76% reduction in death alone (absolute difference 9%; HR, 0.24, [95% CI, 0.06-0.89]; P = .03), while there was no significant benefit in men for heart failure or death (absolute difference 4%; HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.60-1.21]; P = .38) or death alone (absolute difference 2%; HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.49-1.52]; P = .60). Neither women nor men with LBBB benefited from CRT-D at QRS shorter than 130 milliseconds, while both sexes with LBBB benefited at QRS of 150 milliseconds or longer. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this population of patients with primarily mild heart failure, women with LBBB benefited from CRT-D at a shorter QRS duration than men with LBBB. This is important because recent guidelines limit the class I indication for CRT-D to patients with LBBB and QRS of 150 milliseconds or longer. While guidelines do give a class IIa indication to patients with LBBB and a QRS of 120 to 149 milliseconds, the present findings are important to communicate because women are less likely to receive CRT-D than men are. This study exemplifies the potential public health and regulatory science value of combining data from multiple clinical trials submitted to the FDA.",Missing
23288447,Association between World Trade Center exposure and excess cancer risk.,JAMA,Li J and Cone JE and Kahn AR and Brackbill RM and Farfel MR and Greene CM and Hadler JL and Stayner LT and Stellman SD,nyc,"CONTEXT: The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, resulted in the release of known and suspected carcinogens into the environment. There is public concern that exposures may have resulted in increased cancers. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cancer incidence among persons enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Registry. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational study of 55,778 New York State residents enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Registry in 2003-2004, including rescue/recovery workers (n = 21,850) and those not involved in rescue/recovery (n = 33,928), who were followed up from enrollment through December 31, 2008. Within-cohort comparisons using Cox proportional hazards models assessed the relationship between intensity of World Trade Center exposure and selected cancers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cases were identified through linkage with 11 state cancer registries. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and sex were computed with 2003-2008 New York State rates as the reference, focusing on cancers diagnosed in 2007-2008 as being most likely to be related to exposure during September 11 and its aftermath. The total and site-specific incidence rate differences (RDs) per 100,000 person-years between the study population and the New York State population in 2007-2008 also were calculated. RESULTS: There were 1187 incident cancers diagnosed, with an accumulated 253,269 person-years (439 cancers among rescue/recovery workers and 748 among those not involved in rescue/recovery). The SIR for all cancer sites combined in 2007-2008 was not significantly elevated (SIR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.30]; RD, 67 [95% CI, -6 to 126] per 100,000 person-years among rescue/recovery workers vs SIR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.03]; RD, -45 [95% CI, -106 to 15] per 100,000 person-years among those not involved in rescue/recovery). Among rescue/recovery workers, the SIRs had significantly increased by 2007-2008 for 3 cancer sites and were 1.43 (95% CI, 1.11 to 1.82) for prostate cancer (n = 67; RD, 61 [95% CI, 20 to 91] per 100,000 person-years), 2.02 (95% CI, 1.07 to 3.45) for thyroid cancer (n = 13; RD, 16 [95% CI, 2 to 23] per 100,000 person-years), and 2.85 (95% CI, 1.15 to 5.88) for multiple myeloma (n = 7; RD, 11 [95% CI, 2 to 14] per 100,000 person-years). No increased incidence was observed in 2007-2008 among those not involved in rescue/recovery. Using within-cohort comparisons, the intensity of World Trade Center exposure was not significantly associated with cancer of the lung, prostate, thyroid, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or hematological cancer in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Among persons enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Registry, there was an excess risk for prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, and myeloma in 2007-2008 compared with that for New York State residents; however, these findings were based on a small number of events and multiple comparisons. No significant associations were observed with intensity of World Trade Center exposures.

23982367,Association between cholecystectomy with vs without intraoperative cholangiography and risk of common duct injury.,JAMA,Sheffield KM and Riall TS and Han Y and Kuo YF and Townsend CM Jr and Goodwin JS,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Significant controversy exists regarding routine intraoperative cholangiography in preventing common duct injury during cholecystectomy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between intraoperative cholangiography use during cholecystectomy and common duct injury. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of all Texas Medicare claims data from 2000 through 2009. We identified Medicare beneficiaries 66 years or older who underwent inpatient or outpatient cholecystectomy for biliary colic or biliary dyskinesia, acute cholecystitis, or chronic cholecystitis. We compared results from multilevel logistic regression models to the instrumental variable analyses. INTERVENTIONS: Intraoperative cholangiography use during cholecystectomy was determined at the level of the patients (yes/no), hospitals (percentage intraoperative cholangiography use for all cholecystectomies at the hospital), and surgeons (percentage use for all cholecystectomies performed by the surgeon). Percentage of use at the hospital and percentage of use by surgeon were the instrumental variables. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients with claims for common duct repair operations within 1 year of cholecystectomy were considered as having major common duct injury. RESULTS: Of 92,932 patients undergoing cholecystectomy, 37,533 (40.4%) underwent concurrent intraoperative cholangiography and 280 (0.30%) had a common duct injury. The common duct injury rate was 0.21% among patients with intraoperative cholangiography and 0.36% among patients without it. In a logistic regression model controlling for patient, surgeon, and hospital characteristics, the odds of common duct injury for cholecystectomies performed without intraoperative cholangiography were increased compared with those performed with it (OR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.35-2.36]; P < .001). When confounding was controlled with instrumental variable analysis, the association between cholecystectomy performed without intraoperative cholangiography and duct injury was no longer significant (OR, 1.26 [95% CI, 0.81-1.96]; P = .31). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: When confounders were controlled with instrumental variable analysis, there was no statistically significant association between intraoperative cholangiography and common duct injury. Intraoperative cholangiography is not effective as a preventive strategy against common duct injury during cholecystectomy.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Bile Ducts/*injuries/surgery *Cholangiography Cholecystectomy/*adverse effects/methods Cholecystitis/*surgery Cohort Studies Female Humans Intraoperative Care/methods Intraoperative Complications/*prevention & control Male Retrospective Studies Risk"
24306041,Suicide attempt in young people: a signal for long-term health care and social needs.,JAMA Psychiatry,Goldman-Mellor SJ and Caspi A and Harrington H and Hogan S and Nada-Raja S and Poulton R and Moffitt TE,Missing,"IMPORTANCE: Suicidal behavior has increased since the onset of the global recession, a trend that may have long-term health and social implications. OBJECTIVE: To test whether suicide attempts among young people signal increased risk for later poor health and social functioning above and beyond a preexisting psychiatric disorder. DESIGN: We followed up a cohort of young people and assessed multiple aspects of their health and social functioning as they approached midlife. Outcomes among individuals who had self-reported a suicide attempt up through age 24 years (young suicide attempters) were compared with those who reported no attempt through age 24 years (nonattempters). Psychiatric history and social class were controlled for. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The population-representative Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, which involved 1037 birth cohort members comprising 91 young suicide attempters and 946 nonattempters, 95% of whom were followed up to age 38 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes were selected to represent significant individual and societal costs: mental health, physical health, harm toward others, and need for support. RESULTS: As adults approaching midlife, young suicide attempters were significantly more likely to have persistent mental health problems (eg, depression, substance dependence, and additional suicide attempts) compared with nonattempters. They were also more likely to have physical health problems (eg, metabolic syndrome and elevated inflammation). They engaged in more violence (eg, violent crime and intimate partner abuse) and needed more social support (eg, long-term welfare receipt and unemployment). Furthermore, they reported being lonelier and less satisfied with their lives. These associations remained after adjustment for youth psychiatric diagnoses and social class. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Many young suicide attempters remain vulnerable to costly health and social problems into midlife. As rates of suicidal behavior rise with the continuing global recession, additional suicide prevention efforts and long-term monitoring and after-care services are needed.","Adolescent Adult Comorbidity Female Follow-Up Studies Health Status Humans Long-Term Care/statistics & numerical data Male Mental Disorders/*epidemiology Mental Health Services/*statistics & numerical data/utilization New Zealand/epidemiology Personal Satisfaction Social Support Suicide, Attempted/classification/*statistics & numerical data Violence/*statistics & numerical data Young Adult"
